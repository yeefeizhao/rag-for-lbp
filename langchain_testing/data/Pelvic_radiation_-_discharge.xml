            <sectionContent>When you have radiation treatment, color markings are drawn on your skin. Do not remove them. These show where to aim the radiation. If they come off, do not redraw them. Tell your provider instead.
Take care of the treatment area.
Wash gently with lukewarm water only. Don't scrub.Use a mild soap that doesn't dry out your skin.Pat yourself dry instead of rubbing.Don't use lotions, ointments, perfumed powders, or perfumed products on this area. Ask your provider what is OK to use.Keep the area that is being treated out of direct sunlight.Don't scratch or rub your skin.Don't put heating pads or ice bags on the treatment area.
Your provider may recommend soaking in room temperature water.
Tell your provider if you have any breaks or openings in your skin.
Your provider may prescribe medicines to help soothe the skin and prevent infection.
Wear loose-fitting clothing around your stomach and pelvis.

            <sectionContent>Ask your provider how much and what types of liquids you should drink each day.
Your provider may place you on a low-residue diet that limits the amount of roughage you eat. You need to eat enough protein and calories to keep your weight up. Ask your provider about liquid food supplements. These can help you get enough calories.
Do not take a laxative. Ask your provider about medicines to help with diarrhea or the need to urinate often.
You may feel tired after a few days. If so:
Do not try to do too much in a day. You probably will not be able to do everything you are used to doing.Get more sleep at night. Rest during the day when you can.Take a few weeks off work, or work less. 
Watch out for early signs of lymphedema (fluid buildup). Tell your provider if you have:
Feelings of tightness in your leg, or your shoes or socks feel tightWeakness in your legPain, aching, or heaviness in your arm or legRedness, swelling, or signs of infection </sectionContent>

            <sectionTitle>Intimacy</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>It is normal to have less interest in sex during and right after radiation treatments end. Your interest in sex will probably come back after your treatment is over and your life returns to normal.
Women who get radiation treatment in their pelvic areas may have shrinking or tightening of the vagina. Your provider will advise you about using a dilator, which can help gently stretch vaginal walls. You may also want to discuss hormone replacement therapy if you have menstrual changes from radiation or chemotherapy.</sectionContent>
