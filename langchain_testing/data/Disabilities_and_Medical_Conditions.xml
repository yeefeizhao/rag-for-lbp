            <sectionTitle>Disabilities and Medical Conditions</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>All passengers and their property are required to undergo screening at the checkpoint.

                If you need assistance during screening, you or your traveling companion may talk to the TSA officer about the best way to complete the screening process. You may inform the TSA officer of your disability or medical condition verbally, by using the TSA Notification Card or by providing medical documentation.
                
                At TSA PreCheck® lanes, you do not need to remove shoes, laptops, 3-1-1 liquids, light jackets or belts during the screening process. If available, you can request screening by the body scanner machine, also known as Advanced Imaging Technology (AIT). However, removal of light jackets will be required.
                
                To be eligible for AIT screening, you must be able to stand and walk unassisted for the duration of the screening. You must also be able to stand shoulder width apart with your arms above your head for five to seven seconds without support. If you do not want to be screened by AIT, you will receive a pat-down. Pat-downs are conducted by a TSA officer of the same gender and will require the removal of items such as shoes, belts, or light jackets.
                
                A pat-down and additional or enhanced screening of your carry-on property may be required if there is an alarm during screening.</sectionContent>

            <sectionTitle>Fragile Medical Materials (Human Organ Transport)</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>Fragile medical materials consist of, but are not limited to: blood, human organs, bone marrow, skin, human embryos, and eyeballs. We recognize that pre-arrangement may not be always possible, due to last minute scheduling for transportation of fragile medical materials. To allow us to assist you better, we ask medical couriers to request assistance from a supervisor or Passenger Support Specialist (PSS) upon arrival at the checkpoint.

                TSA will review the documentation provided by the courier and ensure that the aircraft operator has been properly notified. The medical documentation provided by the courier may indicate what screening procedures and/or technologies may negatively affect the materials.  Screening may consist of a visual inspection and physical search on the outside of the container, and Explosive Trace Detection testing. We will not open or ask you to open the container.
                
                In some cases, you can have pre-arrangement with TSA by contacting TSA Cares, which coordinates communication between the courier and local TSA airport.  Upon notification from TSA Cares, local TSA management will be notified and will assign a PSS to assist the courier through the checkpoint screening process.  Once the material has been verified, and travel documents and medical documentation have been reviewed, the fragile medical material and courier will be provided assistance by a supervisor or PSS through the screening process, in an expeditious manner, to ensure no damage to the material.</sectionContent>

            <sectionTitle>Medications</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>Medications in pill or other solid forms must undergo security screening. You can facilitate this screening by clearly labeling medication.

                Medication can undergo a visual or X-ray screening and may be tested for traces of explosives.
                
                Inform the TSA Officer
                
                Before the screening begins, inform the TSA officer that you have medically necessary liquids and/or medications. Place them in a bin or bowl separate from other property, along with accessories associated with your liquid medication such as freezer packs, IV bags, pumps and syringes.
                
                3-1-1 Liquids Rule Exemption
                
                TSA allows larger amounts of medically necessary liquids, gels, and aerosols in reasonable quantities for your flight, but you must declare them to TSA officers at the checkpoint for inspection.
                
                Remove medically necessary items from your carry-on bag, and place them in a bin or bowl. If a medically necessary liquid, gel, or aerosol alarms additional screening will be required. If the alarm cannot be resolved, the item may not be allowed.
                
                Accessories
                
                Ice packs, freezer packs, gel packs and other accessories may be presented at the screening checkpoint in a frozen, partially frozen or melted state to keep medically necessary items cool. All items, including supplies associated with medically necessary liquids such as IV bags, pumps and syringes must be screened before they will be permitted into the secure area of the airport.
                
                Screening
                
                TSA officers may test liquids, gels or aerosols for explosives or concealed prohibited items. If officers are unable to use screening technology to clear these items, you may be asked to open them for Vapor Analysis. Screening will never include placing anything into the medically necessary liquid.
                
                Inform the TSA officer if you do not want your liquid medication to be screened by X-ray or opened. Additional steps will be taken to clear the liquid, and you or the traveling guardian will undergo additional screening procedures, which may include AIT screening, a pat-down, and additional screening of your carry-on property.</sectionContent>
