            <sectionTitle>Prosthetic Engineering - Overview</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>Our aim is to improve prosthetic prescription by investigating the efficacy of prosthetic components used in current clinical practice and by developing novel approaches to improve the current standard of care. Our amputee-centric research encompasses improving patient mobility and comfort and preventing injury . Support for this research (2000 to present) includes funding from the Department of Veterans Affairs Rehabilitation Research and Development Service and the National Institutes of Health.</sectionContent>

            <sectionContent>Errors in foot placement while avoiding obstacles and maneuvering in the household and community environments may lead to falls and injuries. This research aims to develop an ankle that can invert and evert and thereby control the center of pressure under the prosthetic foot; enhancing balance and stability of lower limb amputees.</sectionContent>

            <sectionContent>Stochastic resonance (sub-threshold vibration) may enhance peripheral sensation sufficiently to result in improved postural stability and locomotor function.

            <sectionContent>Dr. Aubin’s research spans robotics and biomechanics with applications in health and mobility. He motivates his research by engaging with patients and stakeholders to understand shortcomings in the areas of rehabilitation, prosthetics, orthotics, and physical therapy. Dr. Aubin strives to address these unmet patient and caregiver needs by establishing multidisciplinary research teams that leverage state of the art technologies in robotics, neuroscience, and computational intelligence. Dr. Aubin’s research goal is to develop and utilizes novel sensors, algorithms, assistive powered devices, and robotic tools that can augment human performance and/or improve mobility and function for those affected by disease, age or trauma.</sectionContent>

            <sectionTitle>Smart Cane System</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>People with pain or arthritis in their knee often walk with a cane to reduce knee pain and to improve or maintain their mobility. Increased pressure on the knee joint likely causes knee arthritis and reducing the pressure on the knee joint may slow the progression of arthritis. Walking with a cane reduces the pressure inside the knee joint, but only if the cane supports 10% to 20% of a person’s weight. Many people may not be using their cane in the best way they can because they don’t know how much force (percent of their body weight) they are putting on the cane when they walk. In this study we are looking at how using a computerized cane that beeps or vibrates (like a cell phone) when a certain amount of force is applied to it might help people learn to more effectively use a cane. We are also examining how walking with a cane changes the pressure in the knee joint. We hypothesize that giving the user biofeedback, a sound or vibration signal from the cane, will help them apply the optimal amount of force on the cane. Our secondary hypothesis is that increased cane loading will result in a decrease in knee joint pressure.</sectionContent>

            <sectionContent>It has long been recognized that restoring movement function after amputation is a priority. We are now entering an era in which restoration of sensation may be possible as well through the use of smart sensorized prosthetic devices and haptic feedback. We are working on understanding how feedback of forces and events on the foot - for example the placement of the prosthetic foot as the user is walking down stairs - can lead to improved function.</sectionContent>

            <sectionTitle>Vacuum Suspension Systems</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>Many amputees live with an ill-fitting socket and can experience limb pistoning within the socket, which in turn may result in skin irritation, tissue breakdown, discomfort, and a reduction in activity. The aims of this research are to characterize the response of the lower residual limb to a vacuum suspension system and to measure changes in limb volume with a structured light scanning system.</sectionContent>

Using our fiber-optic video-oximetry imaging system, we aim to discover if prosthetic prescription can influence residual limb tissue oxygenation during both rest and gait.</sectionContent>

            <sectionContent>Sensors monitor skin temperatures Lower limb amputations often experience discomfort related in part to higher skin temperatures within their prosthetic socket. Our research has found prosthetic liners and sockets are excellent insulators that can retain heat. Activity can cause a dramatic increase in skin temperature within the prosthesis requiring substantially long periods of inactivity to restore resting state temperatures. Our current work involves developing active cooling systems and embedded sensor networks to monitor skin temperature.</sectionContent>
