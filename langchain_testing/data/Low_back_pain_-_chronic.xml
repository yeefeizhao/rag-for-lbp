            <sectionTitle>Causes</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>Low back pain is common. Almost everyone has back pain at some time in their life. Often, the exact cause of the pain cannot be found.
A single event may not have caused your pain. You may have been doing many activities, such as lifting the wrong way, for a long time. Then suddenly, one simple movement, such as reaching for something or bending from your waist, leads to pain.
Many people with chronic back pain have arthritis. Or they may have extra wear and tear of the spine, which may be due to:
Heavy use from work or sportsInjuries or fracturesSurgery 
You may have had a herniated disk, in which part of the spinal disk pushed onto nearby nerves. Normally, the disks provide space and cushion in your spine. If these disks dry out and become thinner and more brittle, you can lose movement in the spine over time.
If the spaces between the spinal nerves and spinal cord become narrowed, this can lead to spinal stenosis. These problems are called degenerative joint or spine disease.
Other possible causes of chronic low back pain include:
Curvature of the spine, such as scoliosis or kyphosisMedical problems, such as fibromyalgia or rheumatoid arthritisPiriformis syndrome, a pain disorder involving a muscle in the buttocks called the piriformis muscle 
You are at greater risk for low back pain if you:
Are over age 30Are overweightAre pregnantDo not exerciseFeel stressed or depressedHave a job in which you have to do heavy lifting, bending and twisting, or that involves whole body vibration, such as truck driving or using a sandblasterSmoke </sectionContent>
