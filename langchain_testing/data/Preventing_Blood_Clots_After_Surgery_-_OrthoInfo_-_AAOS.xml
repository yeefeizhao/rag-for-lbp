            <sectionTitle>Preventing Blood Clots After Surgery</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>One of the major risks facing patients who undergo surgery is a complication called deep vein thrombosis.

            Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is the formation of a blood clot within a deep vein. It commonly occurs in the thigh or calf. Deep vein thrombosis can develop after any major surgery. People who have surgery on the legs and hip are especially at risk.
            
            A pulmonary embolism is a blood clot that breaks free and travels through the veins. If it reaches the lungs, it can block the flow of blood to the lungs and heart. A pulmonary embolism is a dangerous condition that can even lead to death.
            
            Your doctor will outline a program to help prevent the development of blood clots after your surgery. This may include periodic elevation of your legs, lower leg exercises to increase circulation, support stockings, and medication to thin your blood.
