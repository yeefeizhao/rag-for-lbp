            <sectionTitle>Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS)</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>The U.S. Department of Labor defines CTS as a disorder associated with
                the peripheral nervous system, which includes nerves and ganglia located outside the
                spinal cord and brain. Carpal tunnel syndrome is the compression of the median nerve
                at the wrist, which may result in numbness, tingling, weakness, or muscle atrophy in
                the hand and fingers. 4 Carpel tunnel syndrome may affect as many as 1.9 million
                people, and 300,000 to 500,000 surgeries are performed each year to correct this
                condition 4 The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported 26,794 CTS cases involving days
                away from work in 2001, representing a median of 25 days away from work compared
                with 6 days for all nonfatal injury and illness cases. Most cases involved workers
                who were aged 25–54 (84%), female, and white, non-Hispanic (75%) 4 Two occupational
                groups accounted for more than 70% of all CTS cases in 2001: operators, fabricators,
                and laborers; and technical, sales, and administrative support 4</sectionContent>

            <sectionTitle>Back injury and back pain</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>Back symptoms are among the top ten reasons for medical visits. For 5%
                to 10% of patients, the back pain becomes chronic. 5-6 In 2001, the Bureau of Labor
                Statistics reported 372,683 back injury cases involving days away from work. Most
                cases involved workers who were aged 25–54 (79%), male (64%), and white,
                non-Hispanic (70%) 7 Two occupational groups accounted for more than 54% of back
                injury cases: operators, fabricators, and laborers (38%); and precision production,
                craft, and repair (17%) 7 Data from scientific studies of primary and secondary
                interventions indicate that low back pain can be reduced by: Engineering controls
                (e.g., ergonomic workplace redesign) Administrative controls (specifically,
                adjusting work schedules and workloads) Programs designed to modify individual
                factors, such as employee exercise Combinations of these approaches</sectionContent>

            <sectionTitle>Arthritis</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>The term arthritis is used to describe more than 100 rheumatic diseases
                and conditions that affect joints, the tissues which surround the joint and other
                connective tissue. The pattern, severity and location of symptoms can vary depending
                on the specific form of the disease. Forty-six million Americans report that a
                doctor told them they have arthritis or other rheumatic conditions. Arthritis is the
                most common cause of disability in the United States. 8 Arthritis limits the
                activities of nearly 19 million adults. 9 Two thirds of individuals with arthritis
                are under age 65. 10 The National Arthritis Data Working Group estimates that 27
                million adults have osteoarthritis. Nine million adults report symptomatic knee
                osteoarthritis, and 13 million report symptomatic hand osteoarthritis. Persons are
                considered to have symptomatic osteoarthritis if they have frequent pain in a joint
                (e.g., pain in a joint on most days of a recent month) and radiographic (e.g.,
                x-ray) evidence of osteoarthritis in that joint, although sometimes this pain may
                not actually emanate from the arthritis seen on the radiograph. Other forms of
                arthritis include rheumatoid arthritis and gout. Arthritis is a concern in the
                workplace both because it may develop from work-related conditions and because it
                may require worksite adaptations for employees with limitations or disabilities.
                11-12 Certain occupations are associated with increased prevalence of arthritis,
                specifically osteoarthritis, most often of the knee and/or hip. These occupations
                include mining, construction, agriculture, and sectors of the service industry.
                12-13 Common features of these occupations are physically demanding/heavy labor
                tasks, lifting or carrying heavy loads, exposure to vibration, high risk of joint or
                tissue injury, and prolonged periods of working in awkward or unnatural postures
                such as kneeling and crawling. In 2003, the total cost for arthritis conditions was
                $128 billion—$81 billion in direct costs and $47 billion in indirect costs 14
                Persons who are limited in their work by arthritis are said to have
                Arthritis-attributable work limitations (AAWL). AAWL affects one in 20 working-age
                adults (aged 18-64) in the United States and one in three working-age adults with
                self-reported, doctor-diagnosed arthritis 15 The National Business Group on Health
                recommends that employers address arthritis by encouraging workers to avoid obesity
                and providing ergonomically appropriate workplace design 16 Early diagnosis and
                appropriate management of arthritis can help people with arthritis decrease pain,
                improve function, stay productive, and lower health care costs. Appropriate
                management includes consulting with a doctor and self management education programs
                to help teach people with arthritis techniques to manage arthritis on a day-to-day
                basis. Physical activity and weight management programs are also important
                self-management activities for persons with arthritis.</sectionContent>

            <sectionTitle>Developing and Implementing Workplace Controls</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>Engineering controls, administrative controls and use of personal
                protective A three-tier hierarchy of controls is widely accepted as an intervention
                strategy for reducing, eliminating, or controlling workplace hazards, including
                ergonomic hazards. The three tiers are: Use of engineering controls The preferred
                approach to prevent and control WMSDs is to design the job to take account of the
                capabilities and limitations of the workforce using engineering controls. Some
                examples include: Changing the way materials, parts, and products can be
                transported. For example, using mechanical assist devices to relieve heavy load
                lifting and carrying tasks or using handles or slotted hand holes in packages
                requiring manual handling Changing workstation layout, which might include using
                height-adjustable workbenches or locating tools and materials within short reaching
                distances Use of administrative controls (changes in work practices and management
                policies) Administrative control strategies are policies and practices that reduce
                WMSD risk but they do not eliminate workplace hazards. Although engineering controls
                are preferred, administrative controls can be helpful as temporary measures until
                engineering controls can be implemented or when engineering controls are not
                technically feasible. Some examples include: Reducing shift length or limiting the
                amount of overtime Changes in job rules and procedures such as scheduling more
                breaks to allow for rest and recovery Rotating workers through jobs that are
                physically tiring Training in the recognition of risk factors for WMSDs and
                instructions in work practices and techniques that can ease the task demands or
                burden (e.g., stress and strain) Use of personal protective equipment (PPE) PPE
                generally provides a barrier between the worker and hazard source. Respirators, ear
                plugs, safety goggles, chemical aprons, safety shoes, and hard hats are all examples
                of PPE Whether braces, wrist splints, back belts, and similar devices can be
                regarded as offering personal protection against ergonomic hazards remains an open
                question. Although these devices may, in some situations, reduce the duration,
                frequency or intensity of exposure, evidence of their effectiveness in injury
                reduction is inconclusive. In some instances, these devices may decrease one
                exposure but increase another because the worker has to “fight” the device to
                perform the work. An example is the use of wrist splints while engaging in work that
                requires wrist bending</sectionContent>

            <sectionTitle>Ergonomics</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>Ergonomics is the science of fitting workplace conditions and job
                demands to the capability of the working population. 1 The goal of ergonomics is to
                reduce stress and eliminate injuries and disorders associated with the overuse of
                muscles, bad posture, and repeated tasks. A workplace ergonomics program can aim to
                prevent or control injuries and illnesses by eliminating or reducing worker exposure
                to WMSD risk factors using engineering and administrative controls. PPE is also used
                in some instances but it is the least effective workplace control to address
                ergonomic hazards. Risk factors include awkward postures, repetition, material
                handling, force, mechanical compression, vibration, temperature extremes, glare,
                inadequate lighting, and duration of exposure. 17 For example, employees who spend
                many hours at a workstation may develop ergonomic-related problems resulting in
                musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs)</sectionContent>
