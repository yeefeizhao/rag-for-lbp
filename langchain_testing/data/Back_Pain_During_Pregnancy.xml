            <sectionTitle>Is back pain normal during pregnancy?</sectionTitle>

            <sectionTitle>What causes back pain during pregnancy?</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>You can blame your growing uterus for your aching back. Your expanding uterus shifts your center of gravity and stretches out and weakens your abdominal muscles. This changes your posture and puts a strain on your back. Plus, the extra weight you’re carrying means more work for your muscles and increased stress on your joints. This is why your back may feel worse at the end of the day. </sectionContent>

            <sectionTitle>What role do the abdominal muscles play in back pain?</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>The abdominal muscles support the spine and play an important role in the health of the back. During pregnancy, these muscles stretch and weaken. These changes also can increase your risk of hurting your back during exercise.</sectionContent>

            <sectionTitle>Do hormones contribute to back pain?</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>Yes, pregnancy hormones can contribute to back pain. To prepare for the passage of the baby through the birth canal, a hormone relaxes the ligaments in the joints of your pelvis to make them more flexible. Back pain can occur if the joints become too flexible.</sectionContent>
