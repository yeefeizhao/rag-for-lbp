            <sectionContent>Treatment and self-care for your neck pain depend on the cause of the pain. You will need to learn:
How to relieve the painWhat your activity level should beWhat medicines you can take
For minor, common causes of neck pain:
Take over-the-counter pain relievers such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB) or acetaminophen (Tylenol).Apply heat or ice to the painful area. Use ice for the first 48 to 72 hours, and then use heat after that.Apply heat with warm showers, warm compresses, or a heating pad. To prevent injury to your skin, DO NOT fall asleep with a heating pad or ice bag in place.Stop normal physical activity for the first few days. This helps calm your symptoms and reduce inflammation.Do slow range-of-motion exercises, up and down, side to side, and from ear to ear. This helps gently stretch the neck muscles.Have a partner gently massage the sore or painful areas.Try sleeping on a firm mattress with a pillow that supports your neck. You may want to get a special neck pillow.Ask your health care provider about using a soft neck collar to relieve discomfort. However, using collar for a long time can weaken neck muscles. Take it off from time to time to allow the muscles to get stronger. </sectionContent>

            <sectionTitle>What to Expect at Your Office Visit</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>Your provider will perform a physical exam and ask about your neck pain, including how often it occurs and how much it hurts. 
Your provider will probably not order any tests during the first visit. Tests are only done if you have symptoms or a medical history that suggests a tumor, infection, fracture, or serious nerve disorder. In that case, the following tests may be done:
X-rays of the neckCT scan of the neck or headBlood tests, such as a complete blood count (CBC)MRI of the neck
If the pain is due to muscle spasm or a pinched nerve, your provider may prescribe a muscle relaxant or a more powerful pain reliever. Over-the-counter medicines often work as well as prescription drugs. At times, your provider may give you steroids to reduce swelling. If there is nerve damage, your provider may refer you to a neurologist, neurosurgeon, or orthopedic surgeon for consultation.</sectionContent>
