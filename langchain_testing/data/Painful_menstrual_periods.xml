            </sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>Painful menstrual periods are periods in which a woman has crampy lower abdominal pain, which can be sharp or aching and come and go. Back pain and/or leg pain may also be present.
            
            Some pain during your period is normal, but a large amount of pain is not. The medical term for painful menstrual periods is dysmenorrhea.

            <sectionContent>Many women have painful periods. Sometimes, the pain makes it hard to do normal household, job, or school-related activities for a few days during each menstrual cycle. Painful menstruation is the leading cause of lost time from school and work among women in their teens and 20s.</sectionContent>

            <sectionTitle>Causes</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>Painful menstrual periods fall into two groups, depending on the cause:
Primary dysmenorrheaSecondary dysmenorrhea 
Primary dysmenorrhea is menstrual pain that occurs around the time that menstrual periods first begin in otherwise healthy young women. In most cases, this pain is not related to a specific problem with the uterus or other pelvic organs. Increased activity of the hormone prostaglandin, which is produced in the uterus, is thought to play a role in this condition.
Secondary dysmenorrhea is menstrual pain that develops later in women who have had normal periods. It is often related to problems in the uterus or other pelvic organs, such as:
EndometriosisFibroidsIntrauterine device (IUD) made of copperPelvic inflammatory disease

   Premenstrual syndrome (PMS)Sexually transmitted infectionStress and anxiety </sectionContent>
