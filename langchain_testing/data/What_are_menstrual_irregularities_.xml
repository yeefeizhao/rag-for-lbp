            <sectionTitle>What are menstrual irregularities?</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>For most women, a normal menstrual cycle ranges from 21 to 35 days. 1 However, 14% to 25% of women have irregular menstrual cycles, meaning the cycles are shorter or longer than normal; are heavier or lighter than normal; or are experienced with other problems, like abdominal cramps. 2 Irregular cycles can be ovulatory, meaning that ovulation occurs, or anovulatory, meaning ovulation does not occur. The most common menstrual irregularities include: Amenorrhea (pronounced ey-men-uh-REE-uh ) or absent menstrual periods: 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 When a woman does not get her period by age 16, or when she stops getting her period for at least 3 months and is not pregnant. Oligomenorrhea (pronounced ol-i-goh-men-uh-REE-uh ) or infrequent menstrual periods: Periods that occur more than 35 days apart. 4 Menorrhagia (pronounced men-uh-REY-jee-uh ) or heavy menstrual periods: 3 , 4 , 7 Also called excessive bleeding. Although anovulatory bleeding and menorrhagia are sometimes grouped together, they do not have the same cause and require different diagnostic testing. 7 Prolonged menstrual bleeding: Bleeding that exceeds 8 days in duration on a regular basis. 4 Dysmenorrhea (pronounced dis-men-uh-REE-uh ): Painful periods that may include severe menstrual cramps. 8 Additional menstrual irregularities include: Polymenorrhea (pronounced pol-ee-men-uh-REE-uh ): Frequent menstrual periods occurring less than 21 days apart 4 Irregular menstrual periods with a cycle-to-cycle variation of more than 20 days 4 Shortened menstrual bleeding of less than 2 days in duration 4 Intermenstrual bleeding: Episodes of bleeding that occur between periods, also known as spotting </sectionContent>
