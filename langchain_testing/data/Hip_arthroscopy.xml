            <sectionTitle>Description</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>During arthroscopy of the hip, the surgeon uses a tiny camera called an arthroscope to see inside your hip. 
An arthroscope is made up of a tiny tube, a lens, and a light source. A small surgical cut is made to insert it into your body.The surgeon will look inside your hip joint for damage or disease.Other medical instruments may also be inserted through one or two other small surgical cuts. This allows the surgeon to treat or fix certain problems, if needed.Your surgeon may remove extra pieces of bone that are loose in your hip joint, or fix cartilage or other tissues that are damaged. 
Spinal or epidural or general anesthesia will be used in most cases, so you will not feel pain. You may also be asleep or receive medicine to help you relax.</sectionContent>

            <sectionTitle>Why the Procedure is Performed</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>The most common reasons for hip arthroscopy are to:
Remove small pieces of bone or cartilage that may be loose inside your hip joint and causing pain.Hip impingement syndrome (also called femoral-acetabular impingement, or FAI). This procedure is done when other treatment has not helped the condition. The surgery is performed to remove excess bone that formed along the hip joint, causing the bones to develop an irregular shape and rub against one another.Repair a torn labrum (a tear in the cartilage that is attached to the rim of your hip socket bone).Repair of your hip tendons.
Less common reasons for hip arthroscopy are:
Hip pain that does not go away and your doctor suspects a problem that hip arthroscopy can fix. Most of the time, your doctor will first inject numbing medicine into the hip to see if the pain goes away.Release of your hip tendons that may be snapping.Inflammation in the hip joint that is not responsive to nonoperative treatment.
If you do not have one of these problems, hip arthroscopy will probably not be useful for treating your hip arthritis.</sectionContent>
