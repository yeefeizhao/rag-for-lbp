            <sectionTitle>Causes</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>Most girls begin their periods between ages 9 and 18. The average is around 12 years old. If no periods have occurred when a girl is older than 15, further testing may be needed. The need is more urgent if she has gone through other normal changes that occur during puberty.
Being born with incompletely formed genital or pelvic organs can lead to a lack of menstrual periods. Some of these defects include:
Blockages or narrowing of the cervixHymen that has no openingMissing uterus or vaginaVaginal septum (a wall that divides the vagina into 2 sections)
Hormones play a big role in a woman's menstrual cycle. Hormone problems can occur when:
Changes occur to the parts of the brain where hormones that help manage the menstrual cycle are produced.The ovaries are not working correctly.
Either of these problems may be due to:
Anorexia (loss of appetite) with low body mass index (BMI)Chronic or long-term illnesses, such as cystic fibrosis or heart diseaseGenetic defects or disordersInfections that occurred before or after the woman's birthOther birth defectsPoor nutritionTumors 
In many cases, the cause of primary amenorrhea is not known.</sectionContent>

            <sectionTitle>Treatment</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>Treatment depends on the cause of the missing period. Lack of periods that is caused by birth defects may require hormone medicines, surgery, or both.
If the amenorrhea is caused by a tumor in the brain:
Medicines may shrink certain types of tumors.Surgery to remove the tumor may also be needed.Radiation therapy is usually only done when other treatments have not worked. 
If the problem is caused by a systemic disease, treatment of the disease may allow menstruation to begin.
If the cause is the bulimia, anorexia or too much exercise, periods will often begin when the weight returns to normal or the exercise level is decreased.
If the amenorrhea cannot be corrected, hormone medicines can sometimes be used. Medicines can help the woman feel more like her friends and female family members. They can also protect the bones from becoming too thin (osteoporosis).</sectionContent>

            <sectionTitle>Outlook (Prognosis)</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>The outlook depends on the cause of the amenorrhea and whether it can be corrected with treatment or lifestyle changes.
