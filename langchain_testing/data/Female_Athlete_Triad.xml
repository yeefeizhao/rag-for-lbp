            <sectionTitle>What causes female athlete triad?</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>The main cause of the female athlete triad is an energy imbalance. This imbalance causes you to use more energy than you consume. Females who are very active may have this problem. It may be on purpose or by accident. The female athlete triad also may be due to an eating disorder, such as anorexia.

                Girls and women may be at risk for the female athlete triad if they:
                
                Are a competitive athlete
                Play sports that require them to maintain a certain weight or to check their weight often
                Exercise more than what is healthy
                Are obsessed with being thin
                Have body image issues
                Are depressed
                Are pushed by their coach or parents to win at all costs</sectionContent>

            <sectionTitle>Treatment</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>The female athlete triad is a disorder that should be taken seriously. Most cases require treatment. A doctor will talk to you about healthy eating habits and lifestyle choices. You may need to change your diet. A nutritionist can help create an eating plan that provides enough vitamins and nutrients. You also may need to change your exercise routine. Your doctor may recommend taking at least one day off each week from athletic training.
            
            If your periods do not return to normal, you may need more treatment. Your doctor may prescribe birth control pills to help regulate your cycle. Hormone medicines that include estrogen or progesterone may help as well. These can balance your energy and improve bone strength.</sectionContent>

            <sectionTitle>Living with female athlete triad</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>Women who have the female athlete triad can develop other health problems. Amenorrhea is a condition that occurs when you miss a period for 3 months or more in a row. Osteoporosis is a disease that makes your bones thin and weak. It can occur when your body doesn’t get the nutrients it needs to help bones grow. It can increase your risk of fractures, breaks, and other injuries. Your organs also can sustain damage due to a lack of nutrients.
            
            Without treatment, the female athlete triad can cause long-term health problems. When combined with a low body weight, it can even lead to death.</sectionContent>
