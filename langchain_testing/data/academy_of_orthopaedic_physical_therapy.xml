            <sectionContent>Physical therapists should use thrust or nonthrust joint mobilization to reduce pain and disability in patients with chronic LBP. Physical therapists may use thrust or nonthrust joint mobilization to reduce pain and disability in patients with chronic LBP with leg pain. Physical therapists may use soft tissue mobilization or massage in conjunction with other treatments to reduce pain and disability in the short term for patients with chronic LBP. Physical therapists can consider the use of dry needling in conjunction with other treatments to reduce pain and disability in the short term for patients with chronic LBP. Physical therapists may use neural mobilization in conjunction with other treatments for short-term improvements in pain and disability in patients with chronic LBP with leg pain. Physical therapists should not use mechanical traction for patients with chronic LBP with leg pain, based on the lack of benefit when added to other interventions. </sectionContent>

            <sectionContent>Physical therapists may use standard education strategies for patients with chronic LBP , but not as a stand- alone treatment. Standard education strategies include advice related to exercise and advice about staying active. Physical therapists should deliver pain neuroscience education alongside other physical therapy interventions, such as exercise or manual therapy, to patients with chronic LBP . Physical therapists should use active treatments (ie, yoga, stretching, Pilates, and strength training) instead of stand- alone educational interventions for patients with chronic LBP . </sectionContent>

            <sectionTitle>Introduction</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent> Low back pain (LBP) remains a musculoskeletal condition with an adverse societal impact. Globally, LBP is highly prevalent and a leading cause of disability.137 In the United States, LBP remains one of the most common reasons to seek health care and, along with neck pain, is the medical condition associated with the highest overall costs.45,50 Surgical cases are the costliest per care episode, but the majority of spending on LBP management can be attributed to the significantly larger volume of nonoperative care episodes.89 Costs for LBP are escalating at a faster pace than overall health care spending and come with no evidence suggesting that there are improved outcomes (ie, reduced pain or disability) at a societal level.45 In fact, a population-based study has suggested that rates of chronic LBP have been increasing during this period of escalating costs.56 In 2018, a series of articles in the Lancet called attention to the high priority of improving the quality of care for operative and nonoperative LBP management.29,54,72 Reducing variability of care to better represent evidence-informed approaches is one way quality of care could improve for LBP. Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) can serve as an important resource in the process of improving quality of care for LBP by synthesizing existing evidence and providing recommendations for evidence-informed treatment options. This information can then be used to assist individual providers with clinical decision making and to encourage health systems to develop clinical pathways that structure care delivery that is aligned with CPG recommendations.64 The development of CPGs for LBP is important, but admittedly only the start of improving patient care. Delivering guideline-adherent treatment as part of routine clinical practice remains a continuing challenge for physical therapists.172,173 </sectionContent>

            <sectionTitle>SCOPE AND RATIONALE</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>Rationale: This is an update to the 2012 Academy of Orthopaedic Physical Therapy (AOPT), formerly the Orthopaedic Section of the American Physical Therapy Association (APTA), CPG for LBP.38 The 2012 guidelines made recommendations for LBP that encompassed a broad scope, including risk factors, clinical course, diagnosis/classification, differential diagnosis, examination, and interventions. Several key considerations guided the 2021 update (see box below). Since 2012, many additional CPGs for LBP have been published, and the primary literature related to LBP has expanded exponentially. The proliferation of CPGs has resulted in convergent recommendations for topic areas included in the 2012 AOPT LBP CPG. For example, a 2020 review of 11 high-quality musculoskeletal pain CPGs (including 4 for LBP) identified consistent best-practice recommenda tions to (1) ensure care is patient centered, (2) screen for red flag conditions, (3) assess psychosocial factors, (4) use imaging selectively, (5) undertake a physical examination to assess impairments, (6) monitor patient progress, (7) pro vide education and evidence-based information as a treatment supplement, (8) incorporate physical activity/exercise, (9) use manual therapy only as an adjunct to other active treatments, (10) offer high-quality, nonsurgical care prior to surgery, and (11) try to keep patients at work.100 An in- press review of 5 high-quality CPGs for LBP produced a synthesis of 13 very similar recommendations for screening, assessment, and treatment approaches.101 This consistency of recommendations for LBP across diagnosis, differential diagnosis, and examination was helpful in supporting the decision to de-emphasize these topic areas for the updated AOPT CPG for LBP. That is, a decision to focus the 2021 update on treatments was made because diagnosis, differential diagnosis, and examination recommendations are well covered in other guidelines. The importance of nonpharmacologic treatments is another development directly relevant to the 2021 update&#8217;s focus on treatments. Since the 2012 CPG, recommendations have been made for nonpharmacologic interventions as first- choice treatments for chronic pain conditions and LBP, as opposed to commonly prescribed pharmacologic treatments like opioids.47,131 However, these recommendations are made broadly, without providing guidance on differentiating the levels of evidence for specific nonpharmacologic treatments.47,100,131 Accordingly, this AOPT CPG update focused on synthesizing new evidence, with the purpose of making recommendations for specific nonpharmacologic treatments.</sectionContent>

        <section>
            <sectionTitle>Scope </sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>Therefore, the overall objective of the 2021 LBP CPG update was to provide recommendations on interventions delivered by physical therapists or studied in care settings that included physical therapy providers. The health question covered by this CPG was to determine which interventions could be recommended for their potential in providing effective pain relief, functional improvement, and/or disability reduction (ie, the primary outcomes for this CPG). The interventions in the 2021 CPG were reviewed in 1 of the following categories: (1) exercise, (2) manual and other directed therapies, (3) classification systems, and (4) patient education. Our primary goal was to make this CPG update applicable to physical therapists practicing globally, and, as such, our literature search was not limited to studies originating in the United States. We acknowledge that there are likely to be differences in factors that influence care delivery for LBP that influence the applicability of these recommendations. For example, differences in health systems, cultural norms, and social determinants of health could all influence the application of these recommendations. Physical therapists are the intended primary audience, but other stakeholders (eg, patients, the public, other provider types, policy makers, and payers) mayfind application in the 2021 CPG update if there is interest in defining evidence-informed care for LBP. </sectionContent>

            <sectionTitle>CONSIDERATIONS FOR THE 2021 CPG UPDATE</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>&#8226;	 Recommendations focused on interventions: while there are many other CPGs for LBP , none specifically addresses interventions commonly used by physical therapists &#8226;	 This CPG excluded studies in which interventions were not provided by physical therapists or in care settings that did not include physical therapists &#8226;	 Recommendations were made for specific subgroups (eg, acute or chronic, leg pain, and postoperative care) as allowed by the available literature &#8226;	 Recommendations were further differentiated with World Health Organization ICF terminology as study eligibility criteria allowed &#8226;	 This CPG includes interventions not considered in the 2012 CPG (eg, dry needling, cognitive functional therapy, and pain neuroscience education) &#8226;	 This CPG includes randomized trials published before July 1, 2020. Thus, these guidelines cannot account for any more recent individual studies, systematic reviews, or meta-analyses that could impact recommendations </sectionContent>

            <sectionTitle>STATEMENT OF INTENT</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>The 2021 LBP CPG update is not intended to be construed or serve as a standard of medical care. Standards of care are determined on the basis of all clinical data available for an individual patient and are subject to change as scientific knowledge and technology advance and patterns of care evolve. The parameters of practice described in this CPG should be considered as guidelines only. Adherence to them will not ensure a successful outcome in every patient, nor should they be construed as including all proper methods of care or excluding other acceptable methods of care. The ultimate judgment regarding a particular clinical procedure or treatment plan must be made based on clinician experience and expertise in light of the clinical presentation of the patient, in addition to the available evidence, available diagnostic and treatment options, and the patient&#8217;s values, expectations, and preferences. However, we suggest that the rationale for significant departures from accepted guidelines be documented in the patient&#8217;s medical records at the time the relevant clinical decision is made. </sectionContent>

            <sectionTitle>Methods</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>Committee members for this CPG update were selected by the AOPT based on content expertise in LBP. The committee was charged with performing a systematic review and evaluation of the literature to produce an updated evidence synthesis for LBP interventions. Meta-analysis of the extracted literature was not performed because it was considered outside the scope of a CPG update. The scope of this update was to consider all relevant literature that has been published since the search for the 2012 CPG. A large body of LBP literature was anticipated, and the committee was subdivided into 4 focus groups, with each category led by a content expert. The 4 intervention categories for this CPG update included (1) exercise, (2) manual and other directed therapies, (3) classification systems, and (4) patient education. Committee members were required to submit conflict-of-interest forms to the AOPT as a condition of authorship. Funding and support for CPG development were provided through the APTA (CPG grant) and the AOPT, as well as support from a dedicated librarian through Duke University. These sponsors did not have any influence over the recommendations in this updated CPG. The development of the final CPG was guided by an expert in CPG development, following standards set by the Institute of Medicine and the APTA Clinical Practice Guideline Process Manual. </sectionContent>

            <sectionTitle>LITERATURE SEARCH</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>A research librarian with experience in systematic reviews updated the original searches that had been completed in 2010 for the 2012 CPG. An initial literature search for this CPG was performed in 2016, a revised search was completed early in 2020, and the final search was completed in June 2020. The literature searches completed in 2020 used a more inclusive list of search terms and removed duplicates from the 2016 search results. Several additional key words and subject headings were included to increase comprehensiveness of the final search. For example, key word synonyms for back pain such as &#8220;back ache&#8221; and &#8220;back strain&#8221; were added to all searches, and new concepts such as treatment-based classification (TBC), multidimensional clinical framework, and cognitive functional therapy (CFT) were added to the classification search. All searches were limited by a filter to include only randomized clinical trials (RCTs), systematic reviews, CPGs, and meta-analyses. The final search strategy consisted of a total of 8 subsearches, based on the aforementioned 4 intervention categories. Multiple subsearches were necessary for the larger treatment categories of exercise and manual and other directed therapies, following the previous LBP CPG search strategy. Exercise subsearches included centralization, progressive endurance, and trunk coordination, while subsearches for manual and other directed therapies included manual therapies, traction, and mobilization. The final search was conducted on June 25, 2020, with no date or language limitations, to capture any new articles based on the addition of updated search terms. Each search was conducted in MEDLINE via PubMed, Embase (via Elsevier), CINAHL Complete (via EBSCOHost), and the Cochrane Library. The 4 sets of search results were compiled in separate EndNote X9 (Clarivate Analytics, Philadelphia, PA) libraries before they were added to a Covidence (Veritas Health Innovation Ltd, Melbourne, Australia) project that contained search results from the 2016 update, which allowed Covidence to deduplicate across all searches and filter to a unique set of articles for screening. Additional information on the search strategies is included in APPENDIX A (available at www. jospt.org). EndNote, Covidence, and Excel (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA) were used to manage literature searches, coordinate article selection, and complete critical appraisals. The search results are presented in APPENDIX B (available at www.jospt.org). Four PRISMA figures that describe the results of the literature search for each of the intervention categories are included in APPENDIX C (available at www.jospt.org). </sectionContent>

        <section>
            <sectionTitle>EVIDENCE SELECTION</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>The evidence-selection process is summarized in FIGURE 1 and described in more detail in the subsequent sections. Title and Abstract Screening and Review of Full-Text Articles Title and abstract screening and full-text article reviews were independently conducted, using prespecified inclusion and exclusion criteria, by 2 team members. Reviewers followed inclusion and exclusion criteria from the 2012 CPG for inclusion in the 2021 CPG update (APPENDIX D, available at www. jospt.org). Conflicts were resolved by a third team member and discussed with content experts as needed. Extraction For each extracted full-text article, 2 reviewers evaluated article quality using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) scale for RCTs and the A MeaSurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) for systematic reviews. The PEDro scale rates 10 internal validity criteria from a Delphi list for assessing RCT quality.164 The AMSTAR rates 11 different criteria for methodological quality in systematic reviews.146 Any conflicts regarding PEDro scale and AMSTAR scores were resolved by the 2 reviewers assigned to the same article. Disagreements unable to be resolved were discussed with the CPG lead author to arrive at the final decision on article score. </sectionContent>

            <sectionTitle>LEVELS OF EVIDENCE</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>The level-of-evidence table (TABLE 1) used for the 2021 CPG update is provided below, and summary information is in APPENDIX E (available at www.jospt.org). Given the size of the body of LBP literature, the committee made the decision to include all systematic reviews but only higher-quality RCTs (PEDro scale score, 6 or greater) in the 2021 update. Thus, the strength of evidence for all recommendations in this CPG is either I or II. The distinction between level I and II evidence was made by focus group members for each intervention category. Because all studies included in this CPG had PEDro scale scores of 6 or greater, the distinction between level I and II evidence was primarily based on number of studies for a given treatment (level I, multiple individual RCTs or systematic reviews/meta-analyses), sample size of individual RCTs (level I, larger sample size), and length of follow-up times (level I, short- and long-term follow-ups). Disagreements on evidence level were resolved by additional discussion until consensus was reached.</sectionContent>

            <sectionTitle>STRENGTH OF EVIDENCE AND RECOMMENDATIONS</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>The strength of recommendations was then given a grade to reflect the confidence in and impact of the included evidence. The strength of recommendation was based on the evidence grade from the 2012 CPG (if available) and the composition of level I and level II studies from the updated literature. Our literature search was limited to RCTs, and there were very few examples of clear superiority for treatment options. Therefore, we modified the language used to avoid any &#8220;must&#8221; recommendations. Instead, we framed recommendations to range from &#8220;should&#8221; (grade A) to &#8220;should not&#8221; (grade D). These grades and how they were determined are summarized in TABLE 2. Further information related to evidence grading is available online (www.orthopt.org). </sectionContent>

        <section>
            <sectionTitle>PATIENT SUBGROUPS</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>Patient subgroups were included in the 2021 CPG update to allow for refinement of clinical recommendations. The 2012 CPG38 differentiated acute, subacute, and chronic LBP; however, the 2021 CPG update only differentiates acute from chronic LBP. This decision was based on the lack of an accepted standard for definitions of subacute pain. Since 2012, there have been operational definitions for chronic LBP reported (eg, the National Institutes of Health Task Force on research standards for chronic LBP and the International Classification of Diseases [ICD], 11th revision).42,120 The committee decided it would be more practical and consistent with the existing literature to only differentiate acute from chronic LBP in the 2021 CPG update. Additionally, we differentiated presence of leg pain, older adults, and postoperative LBP as study eligibility criteria allowed. Therefore, the patient subgroups in the 2021 CPG update were: &#8226;	 Acute or chronic LBP -	 Studies that specifically recruited patients with symptoms for less than or equal to 6 weeks were grouped as acute LBP (ie, this was clearly indicated in the eligibility criteria). All other studies were classified as chronic LBP &#8226;	 LBP with leg pain -	 Studies that specifically recruited patients with LBP, buttock pain, and/or symptoms extending into the leg (above or below the knee) were grouped as LBP with leg pain (ie, this was clearly indicated in the eligibility criteria) &#8226;	 LBP in older adults -	 Studies that specifically recruited patients with LBP who were aged 60 years or older &#8226;	 Postoperative LBP -	 Studies that intentionally recruited patients having surgery for LBP in conjunction with the treatment of interest were grouped as postoperative LBP (ie, this was clearly indicated in the eligibility criteria). Studies that included patients with a history of surgery for LBP were included in other subgroups as indicated (eg, in chronic LBP if meeting the symptom duration criterion) </sectionContent>
        </section>
        <section>
            <sectionTitle>INTERNATIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF FUNCTION</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>An International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) LBP category was included with the recommendation when a study provided enough information in the eligibility criteria. This information was presented to be consistent with the 2012 CPG and to match recommendations to the current CPG&#8217;s ICF system. Briefly, the rationale for including an ICF category is that it provides additional signs and symptoms to support clinical decision making at the individual patient level. The ICF subgroups in this updated CPG remain unchanged from the 2012 version, except for omitting the subacute group. Refer to the 2012 CPG38 for more details on ICF categories for LBP. </sectionContent>

        <section>
            <sectionTitle>CLASSIFICATION CODES</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>There have been no changes in ICD-10 codes that would impact the 2021 CPG update. Therefore, this part of the CPG was not updated or revised, as ICD-10 codes were part of the 2012 CPG. There is a transition planned to ICD-11 codes, which will include coding for primary chronic pain and secondary chronic pain conditions (eg, musculoskeletal).120,125 Changes to the ICD-11 codes are likely to be included in a future CPG update, as we expect that the opportunity to directly code chronic pain will have a noticeable impact on clinical classification of LBP. </sectionContent>

            <sectionContent>It was outside the scope of the 2021 CPG update to provide detailed descriptions for each of the individual treatments included in RCTs. However, for the intervention categories with many different treatment approaches (ie, exercise, manual and other directed therapies), we provide operational definitions that summarized key treatment characteristics. These intervention category sections include a table providing the treatments and their supporting operational definitions. </sectionContent>

            <sectionTitle>GUIDELINE REVIEW PROCESS AND VALIDATION</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>Drafts of the CPG update were reviewed by multiple stakeholder groups to ensure that the goals and priorities of this publication were appropriately developed. Stakeholder groups include additional health care providers and organizations, consumers, patient representatives, and experts in physical therapy practice guideline methodology. The AOPT provides a network of external stakeholders who regularly participate in formal reviews of CPGs, including consumer/patient representatives and claims reviewers, medical coding experts, academic educators, clinical educators, physician specialists, and researchers. The guideline draft was also posted for public comment and review on www.orthopt.org, and a notification of this posting was sent to the members of the AOPT. All comments, suggestions, and feedback from the expert reviewers, the public, and consumer/patient representatives were provided to the authors and editors for consideration and revisions. Additional health care providers who reviewed this CPG methodology and publication include physical therapists and assistants, physicians and assistants, and chiropractors. Acknowledgments of external stakeholders and reviewers are provided at the end of the CPG. There is an annual review of the AOPT CPG performed by experts in physical therapy practice guideline methodology. This review provides feedback to the CPG coordinator and editors to continue to improve and develop APTA guidelines. </sectionContent>

            <sectionContent>The APTA developed a process of endorsing CPGs to increase the reach and adoption of evidence-based practice information. The updated CPG will also be presented at the next Combined Sections Meeting in 2022. Future plans for dissemination include other educational conferences and webinars for clinicians. In addition to publishing these guidelines in the Journal of Orthopaedic &amp; Sports Physical Therapy (JOSPT), these guidelines will be posted on CPG areas of the JOSPT, AOPT, and APTA websites, and made available for free (open access) on the ECRI Guidelines Trust (guidelines. ecri.org) and the PEDro (https://pedro.org.au/) websites. The implementation tools planned to be available for patients, clinicians, educators, payers, policy makers, and researchers, and the associated implementation strategies, are listed in TABLE 3. </sectionContent>

            <sectionContent>There is a lack of RCTs examining exercise training interventions for patients with acute LBP who do not have related leg pain. This paucity of clinical trials is the primary limiting factor in making a stronger recommendation for exercise training. A stronger recommendation will require the completion of level I RCTs investigating the effects of exercise training in patients with acute LBP.</sectionContent>

            <sectionContent>Huber et al79 compared a muscle strengthening and endurance exercise intervention, consisting of supine isometric back extension and abdominal exercises, to advice to reduce activity and loading of the spine in 52 patients with acute back pain with leg pain. Assessments were made before treatment and after 20 days. Patients in the muscle strengthening and endurance exercise group had a greater reduction of pain intensity after 20 days (mean difference, &#8211;1.7 on the numeric pain-rating scale [NPRS]).  </sectionContent>

Patients were randomized to general exercise or specific trunk muscle activation exercises for 3 months. Outcomes were assessed after 3 months and 1 year. There were no differences at the 3-month assessment; however, at 1 year, those receiving specific trunk muscle activation had greater improvement in back pain and disability (mean group difference, &#8211;6.7 on the Oswestry Disability Index [ODI]). </sectionContent>

            <sectionTitle>EXERCISE TRAINING FOR ACUTE LBP WITH LEG PAIN: Evidence Synthesis and Rationale </sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>These 2 RCTs provide evidence of short-term benefit of exercise training interventions, specifically muscle strengthening and endurance versus advice only. There was support for specific trunk muscle activation having a superior long-term benefit when compared to general exercise. The reviewed RCTs had methodologic limitations in the duration of follow-up and generalizability of the study participants. Based on the available evidence, there is support for incorporating muscle strengthening and endurance and specific trunk muscle activation exercise training interventions for patients with acute LBP with leg pain. This would include patients with ICF categories of LBP with related lower extremity pain and radiating pain. A stronger recommendation will require more level I RCTs.  </sectionContent>

            <sectionContent> More research is needed to examine exercise training interventions for patients with acute LBP with and without leg pain. There is a need for level I RCTs comparing exercise training interventions against usual care or other control interventions to clarify whether exercise training interventions provide benefit beyond the favorable natural history of acute LBP. There is also a need for direct comparisons of different exercise training interventions for patients with acute LBP with leg pain. Effort should be made to ensure that individuals recruited into exercise RCTs match demographic and clinical characteristics of those seeking care for LBP.</sectionContent>

            <sectionContent>Sitthipornvorakul et al149 performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of aerobic exercise using a walking intervention for chronic LBP. Nine RCTs were included; 4 compared walking intervention alone to other interventions. Five studies compared walking as an intervention alone to walking in addition to other interventions. For walking alone versus other interventions (general exercise, education), the review found moderate-quality evidence of no significant difference between groups for pain in the short term (pooled standardized mean difference [SMD], 0.07) or long term (pooled SMD, 0.06). Similarly, no differences were found between groups for disability level in the short term (pooled SMD, 0.03) or long term (pooled SMD, 0.15). For walking plus other interventions versus other interventions alone, the review found low- to moderate-quality evidence of no significant difference between groups for pain intensity in the short term (pooled SMD, 0.04) or long term (pooled SMD, 0.00). Consistent with other findings, low- to moderate-quality evidence found no differences between groups for disability level in the short term (pooled SMD, &#8211;0.08) or long term (pooled SMD, &#8211;0.19). </sectionContent>

            <sectionContent>Two RCTs compared aerobic exercise to minimal intervention or control groups. Bruehl et al28 compared aerobic exercise to a usual activity control group in 82 patients with chronic LBP. Posttreatment comparisons (6 weeks) found greater reductions in pain intensity and pain interference in the group receiving aerobic exercise (NPRS between-group mean difference, &#8211;1.5 for average pain and &#8211;1.7 for worst pain). Cuesta-Vargas et al34 compared a deep water&#8211;running aerobic exercise program along with care from a general practice physician to general practice care alone in 58 patients with chronic LBP and found differences favoring the group receiving the deep water&#8211;running aerobic exercise program in pain (pain VAS between-group mean differences: &#8211;14.8 mm at 4 months, &#8211;14.2 mm at 6 months, &#8211;26.0 mm at 12 months) and disability (RMDQ score between-group mean differences: &#8211;3.4 at 4 months, &#8211;3.8 at 6 months, &#8211;2.5 at 12 months).  </sectionContent>

            <sectionContent>Four RCTs compared general exercise interventions to other exercise training interventions. Iversen et al82 found no differences in pain and function across 1 year between general exercise and muscle strengthening and endurance using resistance bands in 99 patients. Harris et al71 compared general exercise to cognitive behavioral therapy or a brief cognitive intervention in 214 patients and found no differences in pain and function at 1-year follow-up. Bello et al20 compared a general exercise program to a general exercise program using graded activity and found no difference between groups after 4 or 12 weeks. Monticone et al114 compared a group-based general exercise program to a group-based general exercise program combined with cognitive behavioral therapy principles in 150 patients with chronic LBP. The group receiving general exercise with cognitive behavioral principles had greater improvements in pain and disability after 5 weeks and 1 and 2 years (NPRS [0-10] between-group mean differences: &#8211;3.1 postintervention, &#8211;1.8 at 12-month follow-up, and &#8211;1.9 at 24-month follow-up; ODI score [0-100] between-group mean differences: &#8211;9.8 postintervention, &#8211;15.8 at 12-month follow-up, and &#8211;15.0 at 24-month follow-up). </sectionContent>

            <sectionTitle>EXERCISE FOR CHRONIC LBP: Evidence Synthesis and Rationale </sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>There are a large number of RCTs examining exercise interventions for patients with chronic LBP. However, most are level II studies with high heterogeneity in patient populations, small sample sizes, and short-term follow-up, including several trials that reported null findings. The available level I RCTs support using multimodal programs and trunk muscle strengthening and endurance exercise interventions for chronic LBP generally and with older adults specifically. No studies reported harm from exercise training interventions. Therefore, exercise training interventions can be broadly recommended for chronic LBP. More level I RCTs are needed to directly compare different types of exercise, as there is no clear evidence of the superiority of one form of exercise training intervention over another. The duration, dosing, and intensity of exercise interventions were highly variable across studies, and controlling this variability should be a focus in future RCTs.  </sectionContent>

            <sectionContent>There is a need for additional level I RCTs evaluating exercise training interventions for patients with chronic LBP. In particular, RCTs are needed that directly compare different types of exercise, examine the optimal way to deliver exercise training interventions with respect to dosage and intensity, and target exercise interventions to particular subgroups of patients with chronic LBP. In addition, the effects of contextual, medical, and/or social factors (eg, expectations for treatment, fear of movement, comorbid conditions, socioeconomic status) that modulate the effects of exercise should also be explored. </sectionContent>

Greater improvements in back pain (adjusted mean difference, &#8211;1.4 points on the NPRS) and disability (adjusted mean difference, &#8211;7.7 on the ODI) favoring the multimodal exercise training intervention were observed after 10 weeks, and in disability (adjusted mean difference, &#8211;8.2 on the ODI) after 1 year. Albert and Manniche3 compared a multimodal exercise training intervention including general exercise, trunk strengthening and endurance, and specific trunk exercises to a sham exercise program in 181 patients. All patients received education and advice. There were no differences between groups in disability at follow-ups of 8 weeks and 1 year.

            <sectionContent>A total of 3 RCTs comparing exercise training interventions to minimal treatment generally support the use of exercise training interventions for patients with chronic LBP with leg pain. One study examined a specific trunk muscle activation exercise program, while the remaining studies used multimodal exercise approaches. The studies do not clearly support one type of exercise training intervention. One RCT with a larger sample size supported the inclusion of postural exercise along with a multimodal exercise training intervention.  </sectionContent>

Khodadad et al88 compared specific trunk muscle activation exercise to cognitive functional training and a control group in 52 patients and found no differences among the groups after 8 weeks. Three RCTs14,124,129 compared specific trunk muscle activation exercises to stretching exercises in studies with small sample sizes ranging from 20 to 42 patients. These RCTs each found better outcomes for the group receiving specific trunk muscle activation exercise in the short term (6-10 weeks), with 1 RCT129 showing continued benefit for disability in the specific trunk muscle activation group after 6 months. </sectionContent>

            <sectionContent>Three RCTs with small sample sizes and short-term follow-ups examined general exercise programs in older adults with chronic LBP. Vincent et al166 examined 49 older adults with abdominal obesity (age, 60-85 years), comparing 3 groups: (1) a general exercise program consisting of total body progressive resistance exercises, (2) an isolated trunk extensor muscle strengthening exercise program, and (3) a control group. The general exercise group had greater improvement in disability after treatment (4 months) than the muscle strengthening group (mean difference, &#8211;2.6 on the ODI and &#8211;3.2 on the RMDQ). Both the general exercise and muscle strengthening groups had greater reduction in pain during movement than the control group (mean difference, &#8211;0.6 on the NPRS). Zadro et al174 examined 60 older adults (age, older than 55 years), comparing a general exercise program provided using video game technology to usual care. The group receiving general exercise had greater improvements in pain (mean difference, less than 1 point on the NPRS) and disability (mean difference, &#8211;1.5 points on the RMDQ) after 8 weeks. There were no differences between groups after 6 months. No adverse events were reported. Homayouni et al78 compared an aquatic general exercise program to a trunk mobility exercise program using flexion and extension, along with passive modalities, in 50 patients with chronic LBP diagnosed with lumbar spinal stenosis. The study found that the aquatic exercise program provided a slight benefit for pain and disability outcomes after 8 weeks, with no differences between groups after 3 months (mean difference, 2.5 on the pain VAS). </sectionContent>

            <sectionContent>There are several RCTs examining manual therapy or other directed interventions for patients with acute LBP. Of the studies included, evidence supports short-term benefits for joint mobilizations (2 RCTs), massage (1 RCT), and soft tissue mobilization (1 RCT). The duration of treatment in these RCTs was short, including no longer than a 3-week period. This is an important consideration when applying these treatments, as there is no evidence investigating the prolonged use of manual therapy or other directed interventions for acute LBP. Furthermore, most of the included studies had a large degree of heterogeneity in intervention delivery parameters. The evidence in support of thrust or nonthrust joint mobilization was stronger than for other directed interventions. </sectionContent>

Seven of these RCTs found short-term improvement in pain and disability outcomes for the group receiving mobilization.44,49,53,76,93,163,165 Sample sizes for these 7 RCTs ranged from 25 to 75, with none including long-term follow-up outcome measures. Some RCTs provided mobilization combined with other interventions, including neural mobilization49 or other physical therapy interventions.93 One small pilot RCT found no difference in pain or function between mobilization and sham treatment.25 Seven RCTs compared thrust or nonthrust mobilization with active treatment comparators in patients with chronic LBP.4,36,113,140,153,155,160 Two RCTs compared thrust or nonthrust mobilization with electrotherapy.4,160 Both RCTs favored the group receiving mobilization. Five RCTs36,113,140,153,155 compared thrust or nonthrust mobilization with different types of exercise. Two of these RCTs found that nonthrust mobilization did not provide greater short-term improvement in pain or disability than did exercise interventions,36,113 with 1 of these RCTs finding greater improvement for a group receiving specific trunk activation exercise.113 Another RCT155 comparing thrust mobilization with an exercise program of stretching and general exercise found that the mobilization group had greater improvement in short-term (5 weeks) pain and disability. Two RCTs investigated mobilization combined with ergonomic advice140 or muscle strengthening and endurance exercise,153 with the groups receiving mobilization experiencing greater short-term improvement in pain and quality of life than groups receiving other types of exercise without mobilization. Five RCTs examined the addition of mobilization to an active treatment that was received by all patients.51,65,118,141,175 Two RCTs that added mobilization to exercise and education51 or to cognitive behavioral treatment and exercise65 found no additional benefit of adding the mobilization intervention.

Two RCTs30,33 compared thrust and nonthrust mobilization techniques to each other. One RCT30 found greater improvement in short-term disability for the group receiving thrust mobilization. The other RCT33 had a larger sample size (n = 149) and reported no significant between-group differences. Two RCTs41,46 compared mobilization techniques that were targeted to specific spinal segments or regions to mobilization techniques that were nonspecific. These RCTs found no differences in outcomes for specific versus nonspecific techniques. The larger RCT41 (n = 148) found that both groups improved in terms of an immediate decrease in pain, but no significant between-group differences were observed. One RCT86 of 32 women with chronic LBP compared thrust mobilization directed at 2 regions (the sacroiliac joint and lumbar spine) to thrust mobilization directed at a single region (the sacroiliac joint). The authors found a single session of thrust mobilization directed at 2 regions to be more effective for improving short-term (48 hours and 1 month) disability than sacroiliac joint mobilization alone.</sectionContent>

Two of these RCTs16,17 compared myofascial release to sham myofascial release and found that the group receiving soft tissue mobilization with myofascial release had greater improvement in short-term pain and disability. Another RCT24 compared the combination of myofascial release and thrust mobilization to thrust mobilization alone and found no significant between-group differences. An RCT by Dayanir et al37 compared 3 separate soft tissue mobilization techniques (manual pressure release, strain/counterstrain, and integrated neuromuscular inhibition), each combined with a home exercise program, to a group receiving only the home exercise program. The group receiving strain/counterstrain had slightly greater improvement in pain and disability compared to the other groups. Kotteeswaran et al92 compared dynamic soft tissue mobilization of the hamstring with a stretching program in young adults (age, 20-35 years) with chronic LBP and found the soft tissue mobilization to be more effective for short-term reduction of pain. Finally, 1 RCT144 compared 4 groups that each received specific trunk activation exercises, with one group also receiving a combination of nonthrust mobilization and soft tissue mobilization, another receiving elastic taping, and another receiving reflexology. There were no differences between groups in pain or disability at 4-week follow-up. </sectionContent>

Two RCTs19,84 compared an exercise intervention provided with or without massage. Both RCTs found that the addition of massage provided superior outcomes compared to those provided by exercise alone. Two RCTs compared specific types of massage (Thai and Ayurvedic massage) with other active comparator interventions. One of these RCTs94 compared Ayurvedic massage with standard massage and found that the Ayurvedic method led to greater short-term (2 and 4 weeks) improvement in pain, but not in disability. The other, larger RCT85 (n = 120) compared traditional Thai massage with joint mobilization and found that both interventions were equally effective for short-term (4 weeks) reductions in pain and disability. One RCT98 compared the effect of interferential current electromassage to superficial massage in patients with chronic LBP and found the electromassage intervention to be superior for short-term improvements in pain and disability. Finally, 1 RCT177 investigated massage with and without a preparatory phase (patients were provided active feedback during the massage, and the preparatory phase included pleasant touch before initiating the massage) and language as therapy for LBP and found that massage improved pain and disability at short- term follow-up, with the experimental group having a more immediate response.</sectionContent>

            <sectionContent>We identified 1 systematic review151 that included 7 RCTs examining neural mobilization in patients with chronic LBP with leg pain and 2 RCTs examining patients with chronic LBP without leg pain. The review concluded that neural mobilization was superior to minimal interventions for pain and disability in patients with chronic LBP with leg pain, but neural mobilization was not superior to comparator interventions.</sectionContent>

            <sectionContent>We identified 4 additional RCTs not included in the systematic review that examined neural mobilization in patients with chronic LBP with leg pain. One RCT49 evaluated advice to stay active, with and without the addition of neural mobilization. The group receiving sciatic nerve mobilization had greater improvement in pain and disability at 4 weeks compared to the advice-only group. Two RCTs examined the addition of neural mobilization for the sciatic nerve to an exercise program. Bhatia et al21 examined the addition of neural mobilization to a physical therapy exercise program and found greater short-term (4 weeks) improvements in pain and disability in the group also receiving neural mobilization. Plaza-Manzano et al127 examined the addition of neural mobilization to a specific trunk muscle activation exercise program and found no significant difference between groups at short-term follow-up (4 weeks). Satpute et al141 added neural mobilization combined with nonthrust mobilization to a program of exercise and electrotherapy, and found that the neural mobilization group had significant improvements in pain and disability compared to the group receiving only exercise and electrotherapy immediately postintervention, as well as at 3- and 6-month follow-ups. </sectionContent>

            <sectionContent>We identified 3 RCTs examining dry needling interventions provided by physical therapists to patients with chronic LBP, each with only short-term outcomes. Griswold et al66 compared dry needling and nonthrust mobilization and found no significant differences in pain and disability after 3 weeks. T&#252;z&#252;n et al158 conducted a small RCT (n = 34) that compared dry needling to a comparison group receiving passive modalities and a home exercise program. The group receiving dry needling had greater improvement in pain immediately following the last treatment session. There was no long-term follow-up. Mahmoudzadeh et al108 examined 58 patients with chronic LBP with leg pain. All participants received physical therapy, with or without dry needling. The group receiving dry needling along with physical therapy experienced significantly greater improvements in pain and disability at the end of treatment and at 2-month follow-up. </sectionContent>

            <sectionTitle>MANUAL AND OTHER DIRECTED THERAPIES FOR CHRONIC LBP: Traction</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>We identified 7 RCTs examining traction for patients with chronic LBP. Six of these RCTs22,40,43,117,128,156 examined the addition of traction to another treatment in patients with chronic LBP with leg pain. Bilgilisoy Filiz et al22 conducted a study of 125 patients who were randomized to mechanical lumbar traction in either the prone or supine position, along with physical therapy, or to physical therapy alone (without traction). The combination of prone traction and physical therapy showed greater improvement in pain and function at the end of treatment (15 sessions) compared to the physical therapy&#8211;only group. Moustafa and Diab117 conducted an RCT comparing hot packs and interferential therapy, with and without the addition of lumbar extension traction. The traction group showed significant improvements in pain and disability at the end of treatment and 6-month follow-up. Diab and Moustafa43 compared stretching and heat with and without the addition of lumbar extension traction, with the traction group showing significant improvements in pain and disability at the end of treatment and at 6 months. Other studies examining the addition of traction to mobilizing exercise,156 to specific trunk muscle activation exercise with massage and electrotherapy,40 and to a standard physical therapy program using an inversion device128 found no differences between groups in pain or disability outcomes. Thackeray et al156 conducted an RCT of 120 patients with LBP with leg pain randomized to receive an extension-oriented physical therapy approach, with or without the addition of lumbar traction. No significant differences were found in pain or disability at the end of treatment and at 6-month or 1-year follow-up. Demirel et al40 performed a pilot RCT of 20 patients, comparing a combination of deep friction massage, electrotherapy, and stabilization exercises with and without the addition of lumbar traction. There were no significant between-group differences in pain or function observed at the end of treatment. An RCT conducted by Prasad et al128 compared physical therapy with or without the addition of gravity-inversion traction in 24 patients. There were no significant between-group differences in pain or disability at the end of treatment. Last, another RCT81 compared high- and low-force mechanical traction in patients with chronic LBP and radiating pain, and found no difference between groups based on the amount of traction force. </sectionContent>

            <sectionTitle>MANUAL AND OTHER DIRECTED THERAPIES FOR CHRONIC LBP: Evidence Synthesis and Rationale</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent> There are numerous studies examining manual therapy and other directed interventions for chronic LBP. There is good evidence in support of thrust or nonthrust joint mobilization for short-term benefit for pain and disability associated with chronic LBP. There was no evidence of differences based on mobilization technique. Other directed interventions had less consistent findings. Some RCTs found evidence of benefit of either soft tissue mobilization or massage when added to other interventions (joint mobilization, exercise), particularly for short-term outcomes, although some studies failed to find benefit. There is little evidence investigating dry needling for patients with chronic LBP. Some evidence supports dry needling to improve short-term pain and disability when paired with joint mobilization or exercise programs. For patients with chronic LBP with leg pain, including patients who would fit the ICF category of radiating pain, evidence supports the addition of neural mobilization to other interventions (exercise, physical therapy). One level II RCT supported adding dry needling to a physical therapy program for patients with chronic LBP with leg pain. Multiple RCTs examined traction for chronic LBP with leg pain, but there was conflicting evidence for the efficacy of lumbar traction. A few studies showed small improvements in short-term pain and disability when mechanical traction was combined with heat, stretching, and/or standard physical therapy, or in comparison to directed modalities. However, the majority of studies showed no additional benefit in pain or disability when traction was added to a program of exercise and joint mobilization.  </sectionContent>

            <sectionContent>Physical therapists should use thrust or nonthrust joint mobilization to reduce pain and disability in patients with chronic LBP. Physical therapists may use thrust or nonthrust joint mobilization to reduce pain and disability in patients with chronic LBP with leg pain. Physical therapists may use soft tissue mobilization or massage in conjunction with other treatments to reduce pain and disability in the short term in patients with chronic LBP.
            Physical therapists can consider the use of dry needling in conjunction with other treatments to reduce pain and disability in the short term in patients with chronic LBP. 
            Physical therapists may use neural mobilization in conjunction with other treatments for short-term improvements in pain and disability in patients with chronic LBP with leg pain. 
            Physical therapists should not use mechanical traction for patients with chronic LBP with leg pain, based on the lack of benefit when added to other interventions. </sectionContent>

            <sectionContent>There is a need for more level I RCTs to examine manual therapy and other directed interventions for patients with chronic LBP, with or without leg pain. Because of the preference for active interventions, study designs examining the effects of adding manual and other directed therapies to exercise can inform the potential value of these treatments when multimodal approaches are used for patient care. In addition, future RCTs examining manual and other directed therapies should incorporate longer follow-up times, as existing trials often only include immediate posttreatment or short follow-up for primary end points. </sectionContent>

            <sectionTitle>Intervention: Classification Systems EVIDENCE STATEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>2012 Recommendations The 2012 recommendations were not divided by patient subgroup (ie, they did not include separate recommendations for acute and chronic LBP). Classification systems represent decision-making strategies that are designed to help physical therapists identify important subgroups of patients with LBP and match the subgroups to the interventions most likely to be beneficial to them.87 The 2012 CPG noted that a few RCTs were available that examined specific classification systems, but the CPG did not provide recommendations about these systems.38 The following endorsements were made regarding classification in general in the 2012 CPG. 1.	 Emphasis in the development of subgrouping methods has been placed on patterns of signs and symptoms from the clinical examination. 2.	 The development of classification systems has been identified as a priority among researchers in the primary care management of patients with LBP. 3.	 The best available evidence supports a classification approach that de-emphasizes identifying specific anatomical lesions after red flag screening is completed. Because the 2012 CPG did not make recommendations about specific classification systems, the authors considered evidence from RCTs cited in the previous CPG in these updated recommendations when there were no RCTs published since the previous CPG literature search. 2021 Update Classification systems were categorized using the operational definitions presented in TABLE 6. Based on the results of our literature search, the 2021 update will include some of the same, but also different, treatment categories as did the 2012 CPG.

            <sectionContent>Operational Definitions for Classification Systems 
            Intervention, Operational Definition 
            Mechanical Diagnosis and Therapy, Classification method based on changes in low back pain (and/ or lower extremity) symptoms in response to direction-specific, repeated lumbar spine movements or sustained postures. Findings are used to classify patients into different syndromes (ie, derangement, dysfunction, or postural) that guide the treatment approach 
            Treatment-based classification, Classification method to guide initial treatment approach (manipulation, stabilization, specific exercise, or traction) based on specific initial assessment findings, including but not limited to patient history, clinical presentation, and physical examination 
            Movement system impairment, Classification method based on impaired trunk movements and postures associated with low back pain symptoms observed during a standardized examination. T est results are used to classify patients based on observed lumbar movement or alignment impairments (rotation, extension, flexion, rotation with extension, or rotation with flexion), with subgroup assignment guiding the initial treatment approach to match specific signs and symptoms 
            Cognitive functional therapy, Classification method that uses an integrated behavioral approach for individualizing the management of low back pain Pathoanatomical, physical, psychological, social, lifestyle, and health-related risk factors are assessed, with nonmodifiable barriers and a modifiable target for change identified to guide treatment based on 3 components (&#8220;making sense of pain,&#8221; &#8220;exposure with control,&#8221; and &#8220;lifestyle change&#8221;). Formerly called O&#8217;Sullivan&#8217;s classification system 
            Prognostic risk stratification, Classification method that identifies patients at different levels of risk for persistent pain (low, medium, high) using a multidimensional screening tool, with each risk category associated with different treatment pathways. Examples include the ST arT Back T ool 
            Pathoanatomic-based classification, Classification method based on pathoanatomic-based findings from examination that could cause low back pain Subgroups are defined by symptom location and response to examination procedures and used to guide the treatment approach   </sectionContent>

Delivery of MDT was categorized as &#8220;adherent&#8221; to the principles of MDT or &#8220;nonadherent.&#8221; Studies investigating adherent MDT found greater reductions in pain (15.0 points on a 100-point scale) and disability (11.7 points) after 3 months compared to RCTs with &#8220;nonadherent&#8221; MDT. Another systematic review identified 7 RCTs that compared the effectiveness of MDT to other interventions in patients with chronic LBP. Lam et al96 found moderate- to high-quality evidence that MDT is superior to other interventions for reducing pain (&#8211;0.33 points) and disability (&#8211;0.28 points) following treatment.

            <sectionContent>The largest number of studies published since the 2012 CPG have examined MDT for patients with chronic LBP. Two of the 3 published systematic reviews supported the use of MDT to reduce pain and disability for chronic LBP, and several of the RCTs found a reduction in pain or disability in the short term, with small or moderate effect sizes, but did not report differences at longer-term follow-ups. There is some evidence to suggest that MDT may be more effective when applied in an adherent fashion or matched to specific examination findings related to directional preference. Two RCTs compared the effectiveness of TBC to other interventions. These RCTs suggested that TBC may be superior to minimal intervention (education) but is comparable to other active treatment approaches (yoga and usual physical therapy). Three RCTs investigated the effectiveness of MSI. The high-quality RCTs suggested that MSI is similar to other active comparator treatments, while evidence from a low-quality RCT suggested that MSI may have short-term benefits when matched to specific clinical examination findings. Two RCTs supported the use of CFT for chronic LBP to reduce pain and disability at short- and long-term follow-ups. A single level I RCT (each) supports the use of prognostic risk stratification and pathoanatomic-based classification to reduce pain and disability. The magnitude of the differences supporting these classification systems ranged from small to moderate, and some systems were associated with differences noted at short- and long-term follow-ups.</sectionContent>

Patient education and counseling strategies for patients with LBP should emphasize (1) the promotion of the understanding of the anatomical/structural strength inherent in the human spine, (2) the neuroscience that explains pain perception, (3) the overall favorable prognosis of LBP, (4) the use of active pain coping strategies that decrease fear and catastrophizing, (5) the early resumption of normal or vocational activities, even when still experiencing pain, and (6) the importance of improvement in activity levels, not just pain relief. 2021 Evidence Update Based on the results of our literature search, the 2021 update will include some of the same, but also different, treatment categories as did the 2012 CPG. </sectionContent>

            <sectionContent>Traeger et al157 performed a large (n = 202) placebo-controlled RCT of adults with acute LBP. The investigators compared intensive patient education over two 1-hour sessions that included information on pain and biopsychosocial contributors, plus self-management techniques, to placebo patient education (active listening without information or advice). This study found a small benefit of patient education for disability at 1 week and 3 months, but not at 6 or 12 months. There was no additional benefit of intensive patient education for pain intensity at any time point. </sectionContent>

            <sectionContent> There were 3 RCTs that evaluated the use of different types of education strategies among patients with acute LBP. Two of these evaluated the addition of intensive education to physical therapy, and they supported the short-term benefits of education for disability and functional end points, but not for pain intensity. In particular, the level I RCT reported a small benefit for disability at short-term follow-up, but not at long-term follow-up, and no additional benefit of intensive patient education for pain intensity.</sectionContent>

            <sectionContent>Physical therapists may use active education strategies rather than passive strategies (ie, providing access to educational materials only). Active education strategies include one-on-one education on the biopsychosocial contributors to pain and self-management techniques, such as remaining active, pacing strategies, and back-protection techniques. Physical therapists may also incorporate counseling on the favorable natural history of acute LBP as part of the education strategy. </sectionContent>

            <sectionContent>A systematic review and meta-analysis168 reported that the use of pain neuroscience education (PNE) resulted in small additional benefits over no PNE for short-term pain (weighted mean difference, 0.73) and that benefits were slightly higher (weighted mean difference, 1.32) when used alongside physical therapy interventions. Likewise, meta-analysis for short&#8208;term disability demonstrated a weighted mean difference of 0.42, favoring PNE compared to no PNE, whereas the addition of PNE to physical therapy interventions demonstrated larger benefits (weighted mean difference, 3.94). Study heterogeneity precluded definitive assessments of long-term (12-month) outcomes. Another systematic review,102 which included some of the same studies as the aforementioned meta-analysis, reported similar findings. Notably, none of the included studies that used PNE alone found improvements in pain, whereas 5 of the 6 studies that combined PNE with another intervention like exercise or manual therapy found significant reductions in pain. </sectionContent>
