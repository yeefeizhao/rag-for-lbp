            <sectionContent>
                Practitioners should provide information or patient education material on 
                back pain prevention and care of the healthy back that emphasizes patient 
                responsibility and workplace ergonomics. 
                Practitioners should emphasize that acute low back pain is nearly always 
                benign and generally resolves within 1 to 6 weeks. 
                There is insufficient evidence to determine what quantity, intensity, or media is 
                optimal for delivering this information. (See patient pamphlet See companion 
                documents, patient information sheets: “What You Should Know About Acute 
                Low Back Pain” and “What You Should Know About Chronic Low Back Pain”

                recommended.

                Refer workers with low back pain beyond 6 weeks to a comprehensive return-to-work rehabilitation program. Effective programs are typically multidisciplinary 
                and involve case management, education about keeping active, psychological, or 
                behavioural treatment, and participation in an exercise program.

                Superficial heat (application of heating pads or heated blankets) is

                Clinical experience supports a role for superficial cold packs and alternating 
                heat and cold as per patient preference. 
                Heat or cold should not be applied directly to the skin, and not for longer than 
                15 to 20 minutes. Use with care if lack of protective sensation. </sectionContent>

                Prescribe medication, if necessary, for pain relief preferably to be taken at regular 
                intervals. First choice acetaminophen; second choice NSAIDs.
                Only consider adding a short course of muscle relaxant (benzodiazepines,
                cyclobenzaprine, or antispasticity drugs) on its own, or added to NSAIDs, if
                acetaminophen or NSAIDs have failed to reduce pain.
                Serious adverse effects of NSAIDs include gastrointestinal complications (e.g. 
                bleeding, perforation and increased blood pressure). Drowsiness, dizziness, and 
                dependency are common adverse effects of muscle relaxants. (See Medication

                Patients who are not improving may benefit from referral for spinal manipulation
                provided by a trained spinal care specialist such as a physical therapist, chiropractor, 
                osteopathic physician, or physician who specializes in musculoskeletal medicine. 
                Risk of serious complication after spinal manipulation is low (estimated risk: Cauda 
                Equina Syndrome less than 1 in one million). Current guidelines contraindicate

            <sectionContent> 
                For subacute low back pain (duration 4 to 8 weeks), intensive interdisciplinary
                rehabilitation (defined as an intervention that includes a physician consultation
                coordinated with a psychological, physical therapy, social, or vocational 
                intervention) is moderately effective.
                Functional restoration with a cognitive-behavioral component reduces work

            <sectionTitle>Acute &amp; Subacute Low Back Pain: Recommendation:Bed Rest</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>
                Do not prescribe bed rest as a treatment. 
                If the patient must rest, bed rest should be limited to no more than 2 days. 
                Prolonged bed rest for more than 4 days is not recommended for acute low 
                back problems. Bed rest for longer than two days increases the amount of sick 
                leave compared to early resumption of normal activity in acute low back pain. 
                There is evidence that prolonged bed rest is harmful. </sectionContent>

                For acute low back pain (no red flags), diagnostic imaging tests, including 
                X-ray, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
                are not indicated. 
                In the absence of red flags, routine use of X-rays is not justified due to the risk 
                of high doses of radiation and lack of specificity</sectionContent>

                Do not use traction. Traction has been associated with significant adverse events.
                Passive treatment modalities such as traction should be avoided as monotherapy and not routinely used because they may increase the risk of illness 
                behaviour and chronicity. 
                The following adverse effects from traction were reported: reduced muscle tone, 
                bone demineralization, and thrombophlebitis. </sectionContent>

                There is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of opioids in the treatment
                of acute low back pain. However clinical experience suggests the use of opioids 
                may be necessary to relieve severe musculoskeletal pain. If used, opioids are 
                preferable for only short term intervention. Ongoing need for opioids is an 
                indication for reassessment. 
                In general, opioids and compound analgesics have a substantially increased 
                risk of side effects compared with acetaminophen alone. </sectionContent>

            <sectionContent>
                In chronic low back pain, X-rays of the lumbar spine are very poor indicators 
                of serious pathology. Hence, in the absence of clinical red flags spinal X-rays
                are not encouraged. More specific and appropriate diagnostic imaging should
                be performed on the basis of the pathology being sought (e.g. DEXA scan for
                bone density, bone scan for tumours and inflammatory diseases). However,
                lumbar spine X-rays may be required for correlation prior to more sophisticated 
                diagnostic imaging, for example prior to an MRI scan. In this case, the views 
                should be limited to standing AP and lateral in order to achieve better assessment 
                of stability and stenosis. Oblique views are not generally recommended. CT 
                scans are best limited to suspected fractures or contraindication to MRI. 
                In the absence of red flags, radiculopathy, or neurogenic claudication, MRI
                scanning is generally of limited value. 
                Oblique view X-rays are not recommended; they add only minimal information in a
                small percentage of cases, and more than double the patient’s exposure to radiation. </sectionContent>

                Patients should be encouraged to initiate gentle exercise and to gradually 
                increase the exercise level within their pain tolerance. 
                Sophisticated equipment is not necessary. Low cost alternatives include 
                unsupervised walking and group exercise programs, such as those offered by 
                chronic disease management programs. The peer support of group exercise is 
                likely to result in better outcomes, giving patients improved confidence and
                empowering them to manage with less medical intervention. 
                When exercise exacerbates the patient’s pain, the exercise program should be
                assessed by a qualified physical therapist or exercise specialist.
                If exercise persistently exacerbates their pain, patients should be further assessed 
                by a physician to determine if further investigation, medication, treatment, or 
                consultation is required. 
                Some studies reported mild negative reactions to exercise programs, such as

                core skills such as self monitoring of symptoms to determine likely causal 
                factors in pain exacerbations or ameliorations, activity pacing, relaxation 
                techniques, communication skills, and modification of negative ‘self talk’ or 
                catastrophizing. These programs use goal setting and ‘homework assignments’
                to encourage participants’ self confidence in their ability to successfully 
                manage their pain and increase their day-to-day functioning. Most communitybased programs also include exercise and activity programming which are also

                Acetaminophen and NSAIDs are recommended. No one NSAID is more

                A proton pump inhibitor (PPI) should be considered for patients over 45 years 
                of age when offering treatment with an oral NSAID/COX-2 inhibitor.
                NSAIDs are associated with mild to moderately severe side effects such 
                as: abdominal pain, bleeding, diarrhea, edema, dry mouth, rash, dizziness,

            <sectionContent>
                Long-term use of weak opioids, like codeine, should only follow an unsuccessful 
                trial of non-opioid analgesics. In severe chronic pain, opioids are worth careful 
                consideration. Long acting opioids can establish a steady state blood and tissue 
                level that may minimize the patient’s experience of increased pain from medication
                withdrawal experienced with short acting opioids. 
                Careful attention to incremental changes in pain intensity, function, and side effects 
                is required to achieve optimal benefit. Because little is known about the long-term
                effects of opioid therapy, it should be monitored carefully. 
                Opioid side-effects (including headache, nausea, somnolence, constipation, dry 
                mouth, and dizziness) should be high in the differential diagnosis of new complaints. 
                A history of addiction is a relative contraindication. Consultation with an addictions 
                specialist may be helpful in these cases. 
                Consult the Canadian Guideline for Safe and Effective Use of Opioids for Chronic NonCancer Pain endorsed by the CPSA. http://nationalpaincentre.mcmaster.ca/opioid/

                acute exacerbations of chronic low back pain: 
                • An aqueous extract of Harpagophytumprocumbens (also called Devil’s 
                Claw, grapple plant, wood spider) at a standardized daily dosage of 50 
                mg harpagoside, 
                • A combination of extract of Salix daphnoides and Salix purpurea (also 
                called purple willow, red willow) at a standardized dosage of 240 mg 
                salicin/day and 
                • A plaster of Capsicum frutescens (also called bird pepper, hot pepper, red 
                chili, spur pepper, Tabasco pepper) 
                Devil’s Claw was associated with the following adverse events: repeated 
                coughs, tachycardia, and gastrointestinal upset. Use of Capsicum frutescens 
                plaster was associated with inflammatory contact eczema, urtcaria, minute 
                haemorragic spots, vesiculation or dermatitis, sensation of warmth locally 
                and pruritis. 
                Patients should be advised to read the product ingredients to ensure they 
                are getting the correct amount and correct product mentioned in the 
                recommendation. It is important to be aware that a product could list on the 
                label different extracts of the same active ingredient (e.g. Devil’s Claw and 
                wood spider). 
                Devil’s Claw, Salix and Capsicum frutescens are currently regulated by Health 
                Canada. (See http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/dhp-mps/prodnatur/applications/licenprod/lnhpd-bdpsnh-eng.php)</sectionContent>

                The following injection therapies may be beneficial for carefully selected 
                patients (see Appendix C) with a clinical diagnosis of pain originating from 
                the lumbar facet joints: 
                • Intra-articular facet joint blocks 
                • Medial branch blocks (studies show benefit for up to 6 weeks, and 
                sometimes longer)
                • Medial branch neurotomy (studies demonstrate pain relief lasting longer 
                than 3 months)
                The clinical diagnosis of facet joint pain lacks specificity and may be best 
                determined by a trained spinal care specialist. 
                The most commonly reported adverse events are:

                For patients with leg pain, epidural steroid injections can be effective in

                Fluoroscopy improves/verifies accuracy. Even in the most experienced hands, 
                epidural injections can be misplaced.

            <sectionContent>
                Consider referral for an opinion on spinal fusion for patients who: 
                • Have completed an optimal package of care including a combined physical 
                and psychological treatment program (usually 6 months of care); and
                • Still have severe low back pain for which the patient would consider 
                surgery, particularly if related to spinal stenosis with leg pain. 
                Offer anyone with significant psychological distress appropriate treatment for
                this before referral for an opinion on spinal fusion. 
                Refer the patient to a specialist spinal surgical service if spinal fusion is being 
                considered. Give due consideration to the possible risks in that patient. Counsel

            <sectionContent>Injections therapies, including Prolotherapy, Facet Joint Blocks, Medial Branch Blocks and 
                Neurotomy are areas of active research and the clinical factors that predict their optimum use
                remain undetermined at present. Nonetheless, clinically, there appears to be reason to support
                their use in carefully selected patients. At present they are recommended only for patients 
                selected by a clinician with training and experience in evaluating the physical examination 
                findings that the receiving physician has agreed are predictive of successful intervention. The
                evaluating clinician may be another physician with an interest in these treatment modalities, or 
                a similarly qualified physiotherapist, chiropractor. This requires a degree of local co-operation
                to establish the appropriate referral networks, which is not feasible in all settings. 
                Physical examination findings predictive of facet joint origin for low back pain:
                While published research suggests a significant degree of inter-examiner variability in 
                interpreting physical examination findings, the following are considered by the authors to be 
                suggestive of a facet joint origin for low back pain. Within the limitations noted above, such 
                patients may be considered for referral for facet joint blocks as a confirmatory test:
                • Pain is often of rapid onset. 
                • Pain is unilateral or bilateral at or above the belt-line. If radiation to the leg is present it 
                tends to be to the buttocks or lateral thigh and rarely below the knee. 
                • Pain tends to be worse with low back extension, and may be relieved with flexion or 
                sitting. 
                • Pain may be provoked with palpation over the paravertebral tissues in the area of the 
                facet joints lateral to the midline, and often under several layers of muscle that may also 
                be pain generators. 
                • Pain may be provoked by a “Facet Joint Loading Maneuvers” on physical examination, 
                for example: while standing with feet pointing ahead at shoulder distance apart, the 
                patient is asked to look over one shoulder, followed by trunk rotation to the same side, 
                then lumbar extension. The resulting lumbar extension in combination with side-bending 
                and rotation will cause facet joint loading on the same side. The examiner may need to 
                help stabilize the patient to prevent a loss of balance.
