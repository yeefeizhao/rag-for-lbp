            <sectionTitle>How to get Started</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>Look for yoga classes at your local gym, health center, or yoga studio.
                If you are new to yoga, start with a beginner class. Talk with the instructor before
                the class and tell them about any injuries or health conditions you may have.
                You may want to ask about the instructor's training and experience. However, while
                most instructors have had some formal training, there is no objective yoga
                certification body. Choose an instructor you enjoy working with who does not push
                you in ways you are not comfortable.</sectionContent>

            <sectionContent>Most yoga classes last from 45 to 90 minutes. All styles of yoga include
                three basic components:
                Breathing. Focusing on your breathing is an important part of yoga. Your teacher may
                offer instruction on breathing exercises during the class.Poses. Yoga poses, or
                postures, are a series of movements that help boost strength, flexibility, and
                balance. They range in difficulty from lying flat on the floor to difficult
                balancing poses.Meditation. Yoga classes usually end with a short period of
                meditation. This quiets the mind and helps you relax. </sectionContent>
