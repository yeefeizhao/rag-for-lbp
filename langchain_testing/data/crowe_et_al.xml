            <sectionTitle>Background.</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent> Chronic low back pain is a complex disorder, challenging to treat, and
                associated with wide-ranging adverse consequences including physical disability,
                psychosocial disruption, and increased use of healthcare resources. Most clinical
                guidelines suggest that self-management strategies are the best treatment option.</sectionContent>

            <sectionContent>A qualitative analysis was conducted of semi-structured interviews with 64
                people identiﬁed as having chronic low back pain and 22 healthcare professionals
                nominated by that person. The interviews were conducted in 2008. The people with
                chronic low back pain were asked about their self-management strategies; health-
                care professionals were asked about how they perceived their role in the person’s
                self-management. Data were analysed using a content analysis.</sectionContent>

            <sectionContent> The most common strategies used by participants to manage their chronic
                low back pain were medication, exercise and application of heat. The nominated
                healthcare professionals were predominantly physiotherapists and general practi-
                tioners. Physiotherapists described exercises, particularly those aimed at improving
                core strength, as the main strategy that they encouraged people to use. General
                practitioners regarded themselves as primarily having three roles: prescription of
                pain medication, dispensing of sickness certiﬁcates, and referral to specialists.</sectionContent>

            <sectionContent>People with chronic low back pain use self-management strategies that
                they have discovered to provide relief and to prevent exacerbation. The strategies
                reﬂect an active process of decision-making that combines personal experience with
                professional recommendations.</sectionContent>

            <sectionTitle>Introduction</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>
                Chronic low back pain is a complex disorder, challenging to
                treat, and associated with wide-ranging adverse consequences
                including physical disability (Weiner et al. 2006), psychosocial
                disruption (Reid et al. 2003), and increased use of healthcare
                resources (Carey et al. 1995). Because of its prevalence nurses
                will care for many people experiencing this condition,
                although this may not be the index condition for which they
                are receiving care. It is likely that it may be a comorbidcondition for which advanced nursing practice across primary
                care, acute care and rehabilitative care has a signiﬁcant role
                (Williams 2004). It is important, therefore, to understand how
                people with chronic low back pain manage their condition.</sectionContent>

            <sectionTitle>Background</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>
                More than 80% of the population will experience low back
                pain at some stage in their lives (Rubin 2007). Most will
                recover, but around 5% of the population will develop
                chronic low back pain (i.e. pain that lasts longer than3 months) (Freburger et al. 2009). People with higher than
                average initial pain intensity, longer duration of symptoms
                and more previous episodes are more likely to develop
                chronic low back pain (Hancock et al. 2009). While the
                traditional biomedical model may provide an adequate
                conceptual framework for the management of acute pain, it
                is not appropriate for chronic pain (Justins 1996).
                In a comprehensive review of treatments for chronic low
                back pain, Van Tulder et al. (2006) found several treatments
                to be effective for short-term improvement of function, namely
                COX2 inhibitors (a type of non-steroidal anti-inﬂammatory
                drug), back schools (education programmes), progressive
                relaxation, exercise therapy and multidisciplinary treatment.
                They noted that there was no evidence that any of these
                interventions have long-term effects on pain and function, and
                that many of the trials had methodological weaknesses.
                The British Medical Journal Clinical Evidence series on
                best treatment of back pain (BMJ Publishing Group Ltd
                2009) also supports exercise and promotes a multidisciplin-
                ary treatment programme that could includes cognitivebehavioural therapy, treatment with hot and cold packs,
                transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, massage, relaxa-
                tion exercises and hydrotherapy.
                In New Zealand, the Acute Low Back Pain Guide,
                published by the Kendall et al. (1997, p.30) and based on
                British and American guidelines, notes that attempts to
                prevent the development of chronic pain through physiolog-
                ical or pharmacological interventions in the acute phase have
                been relatively ineffective, and that inadequate control ofacute pain may increase the risk of chronic pain. These
                clinical guidelines do not include any treatment for chronic
                low back pain, but emphasize the importance of self-
                management techniques and the success of these techniques
                for return to work.
                Because there is no effective long-term medical treatment
                for chronic low back pain, there has been an increasing
                emphasis on self-management. The principles of self-man-
                agement in chronic conditions have primarily been derived
                from Stanford University’s Chronic Disease Self-ManagementProgram (Lorig et al. 1999). This focuses on (1) techniques to
                deal with problems such as frustration, fatigue, pain and
                isolation, (2) appropriate exercise for maintaining and
                improving strength, ﬂexibility and endurance, (3) appropriate
                use of medications, (4) communicating effectively with
                family, friends and healthcare professionals, (5) nutrition
                and (6) how to evaluate new treatments (Lorig et al. 1999).
                The Flinders Programme (Battersby et al. 2007) identiﬁes
                itself as complementary to the Stanford model and proposesthat self-management involves the person with the chronic
                condition engaging in activities that protect and promote
                health, monitoring and managing the symptoms and signs of
                illness, managing the impact of illness on functioning,
                emotions and interpersonal relationships and adhering to
                treatment regimes. It is interesting that neither of these
                programmes prioritizes the person’s experience and expertise
                as central to the process, but rather suggests that people with
                chronic illness need education. Holm (2005) has suggested
                that a ﬁrst person perspective and the patient’s understanding
                of their own lived body is central to the successful manage-ment of disease.
                Despite this emphasis on self-management, there is little
                research from the perspective of the person experiencing
                chronic low back pain about how to manage the pain and
                disability, and which strategies are effective. Equally, research
                on clinicians’ recommendations about self-management is
                limited. In a qualitative study exploring the self-management
                strategies used by people with chronic low back pain, May
                (2007) found that exercises and a general awareness of havinga back problem were the most common. Other strategies
                included application of heat, massage, analgesics, help from
                family, wearing a corset at work, pacing activities and use of
                information from a self-help book.</sectionContent>

                The aim of the study was to explore the self-management

                facilitating self-management.</sectionContent>

                This was a qualitative study using semi-structured interviews.
                A qualitative approach was employed to capture what
                participants were doing to manage their chronic low back
                pain without using pre-determined categories and to enable
                individual strategies to emerge.</sectionContent>

            <sectionContent>
                People were included in the study if they were 18 years of age
                or over and suffering from chronic low back pain, deﬁned as
                pain, muscle tension or stiffness localized below the costal
                margin and above the inferior gluteal folds, with or without
                leg pain (sciatica), and persisting for longer than 12 weeks.Healthcare professionals were included if nominated by
                recruits with chronic low back pain.</sectionContent>

            <sectionTitle>Participants: Recruitment</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>
                Participants were recruited via two different avenues between
                April and November 2008. The majority (80%) were re-
                cruited through response to an article on chronic lower back
                pain in a free community health newsletter. The remaining
                participants were recruited through physiotherapy clinics.
                Because individuals recruited though the article opted in to
                the research study by contacting the researcher, a fullassessment was undertaken by a trained research assistant to
                ensure that they met inclusion criteria. In addition, their
                medical notes were accessed with their permission to conﬁrm
                the diagnosis. All recruits who met the inclusion criteria were
                included in the sample. The sample size was determined by
                response rates to the advertisements over a 6-month period.</sectionContent>

            <sectionContent>
                Face-to-face semi-structured interviews were conducted with
                the people with low back pain, asking questions about their
                pain experience, management of the pain, and perceived
                barriers and facilitators in treatments for managing chronic
                low back pain. The interview was semi-structured around a
                series of prompts (see Table 1). All interviews were conducted
                by an experienced research assistant with training in the
                conduct of qualitative interviews. The process was supervised
                by one of the investigators to ensure procedural rigour and to
                review the content of the tape-recorded interviews.The nominated healthcare professionals were interviewed
                via telephone as most had identiﬁed this as the preferredmode. A series of prompts was used, as shown in Table 2.</sectionContent>

            <sectionContent>
                Ethics approval was obtained from the appropriate com-
                mittee before recruitment of participants. The advertise-
                ment used had ethics approval. The interviews were
                digitally recorded and then immediately down-loaded into
                a computer storage programme. These ﬁles were then sentelectronically to one experienced audio-typist, who was
                required to sign the conﬁdentiality and storage statement
                required in the ethics approval. The transcribed ﬁles were
                then stored in a secure folder on a university computer
                system.</sectionContent>

            <sectionTitle>Data analysis</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>
                Interviews were transcribed verbatim and content analysis
                conducted to identify key self-management strategies. Qual-
                itative content analysis has been described by Graneheim &amp;Lundman (2004) as an interpretive process that involves
                examining texts for manifest and latent content. It involves
                an in-depth exploration of the text for meaning units within
                a speciﬁc content area, in this case, self-management
                practices, and then the development of categories for these.
                The focus in this study was the manifest content. This approach was chosen as the analytic framework because it
                enabled identiﬁcation of what the participants were doing
                rather than exploring latent meaning in an interpretive
                process.
                Coding was conducted manually by one very experienced
                analyst and the codes were validated by two of the other
                investigators. Saturation was achieved when it was identiﬁed
                that no more manifest content was emerging, however all
                transcripts were analysed to achieve this.</sectionContent>

                interviewer to ensure consistency and reliability in data
                collection. All the tape-recorded interviews were reviewed by
                two of the investigators. The initial content analysis was
                conducted by one investigator and conﬁrmed independentlyby other investigators. Sufﬁcient raw data are presented here

            <sectionTitle>People with chronic low back pain</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>
                The participants were 64 individuals suffering from chronic
                lower back pain and their nominated healthcare profession-
                als. There were 31 women and 33 men in the sample, with anaverage age of 55 Æ1 years (SD=13*2; range 25–80 years). The
                majority (81%) identiﬁed themselves as New Zealand Euro-
                pean. The duration of the interviews ranged from 12 to
                45 minutes.
                The most common strategies used to manage chronic low
                back pain were medication, exercise and heat. Of these, use
                of medication was the most commonly cited, with most
                participants describing use of both anti-inﬂammatory med-
                ication and analgesics.</sectionContent>
        </section>
        <section>
            <sectionTitle>Taking medication</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>
                A few of the participants used general practitioner-prescribed
                analgesics to manage their pain when it was severe:
                I’ve got [oxycodone] that I have in the morning and at night time, and
                if I have any breakthrough or really, really bad pain, I’ve got a bottleof pethidine at home.
                When it gets really severe that’s when I will resort to pain killers and
                it depends on what I’ve done through the day and how severe it’s
                going to be yeah.However, the most commonly used medications were over-
                the-counter typed – paracetamol and non-steroidal anti-
                inﬂammatory medications:
                I take [paracetamol] or [ibuprofen] or something like that. They are
                pretty good. Otherwise I just yeah, just get on with it.
                Sometimes it is just so bad that I have to go inside and sit down or
                take a [paracetamol] or something and wait for it to disappear and
                then get back out there. And it’s usually an hour and you are back
                into it again.
                I keep forgetting I am allowed to take some pain killers so I suppose
                when I know it might escalate I will take some ibuprofen or
                [paracetamol]. That helps. When I remember I am allowed to;
                because I am not a pill person.
                Participants expressed a general reluctance to use medica-
                tions and a form of medical compliance related to being
                ‘allowed’ to take medication. The medication was primarily
                used to enable them to ‘ just get on with it’ .</sectionContent>

            <sectionContent>
                Low impact exercise was also strongly favoured as a
                self-management strategy by participants. Some did exer-
                cises that they had been taught by physiotherapists, or that
                other people with chronic low back pain had told them
                about:
                Some of the exercises I have [learned from physiotherapist], others
                you know you hear about or somebody will tell you ‘‘well I do this or
                I do that’’ and so you give it a try.
                [I do] exercises that the physio [physiotherapist] taught me. Um, it
                got really sore again while I was doing the physio, I did something.
                Can’t remember what it was and it was really sore again and I
                couldn’t do the exercises I was meant to do so I went back to do the
                early ones they taught me. And that sort of relaxed and stretched it a
                bit and I went back into those and it worked really well and it was
                only about a week later and I was nearly back to where I was
                beforehand.
                I’ve been doing the Pilates at physiotherapy and the walking has
                vastly improved my condition.
                Well I’m walking for an hour every day, maybe 3 days a week I’m
                cycling well not very far, 10–15 minutes sometimes down to the hall
                which is about 15 minutes away; and then I swim for half an hour,
                but I try to do that 5 days a week but as I say I walk a friend’s dog
                and that’s some exercise.
                The use of low impact exercise was generally a strategy that
                participants had learned from physiotherapists or from others
                with a similar condition.</sectionContent>

            <sectionTitle>Direct heat</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent> 
                The participants also described the effectiveness of direct
                heat, either in the form of showers or baths or electric
                blankets or wheat packs:
                I have a lot of baths. I like a really nice hot bath as well but I ﬁnd, and
                right from the beginning I found the heat really always helped so
                that’s good.
                When I have a shower I just turn the water up hot as hot as hell and
                direct it to where it’s sore.
                Somebody gave me one of those wheat packs that you heat up and
                that helps, that’s good.
                One thing that helps is putting the electric blanket on in the morning
                to warm my body up and warm my back.
                The use of direct heat could be regarded as a strategy learned
                from personal experience, as the participants indicated that it
                was something they had learned to do for themselves rather
                than being advised to do.
                Other commonly used strategies were pacing, environmen-
                tal awareness and diversional activities:
                I usually pace myself on what I do on a daily basis and I know what I
                can and can’t do.
                If I carry on working all the time, just continuously doing housework
                or bending down, doing the dusting and things, it comes and it won’t
                go. The back pain gets worse and worse until I actually stop. Then I
                have a rest and then I just have to leave it for next time.
                I modify my environment. Like in my car I’ve got you know a cushion
                that I sit on in the car because it’s comfortable and it’s the right level for
                me and I’ve got to have the car seat exactly at the right place and if I’m
                going on a long trip I have to make sure it’s right before I start because
                when I get there it will be wrong, you know my back will be so bad.
                I have hobbies that I do so I like to get involved really stuck in with what
                I’m doing to take my mind off the pain. So I just basically keep going.
                And I ﬁnd music very helpful, absolutely. I take 1 hour out each day
                and that’s my quality time where I listen to music.
                While they may have got the idea for these other strategies
                from physiotherapists, the ways in which they were imple-
                mented were based on personal experience.
                Many participants had a sense of resignation and frustra-
                tion about the effectiveness of strategies for relief of their
                chronic low back pain, and described coping strategies:
                You just have to put up with it.
                I don’t think there’s a lot, I mean when it’s full on and giving me as
                much as it can there is nothing, there is nothing you can do except tojust grin and bear it and hope like hell there’s no one around there
                listening to you moaning and groaning.
                I guess you rationalize it into your life, like I mean things could be a
                whole lot worse so you know just get on with it really.
                I don’t tend to take pills terribly much. Um, I mean I do if it is really,
                really, really, really bad but I don’t tend to, I tend to just put up with
                it really.
                I’m resigned to the fact now that if I’ve got a really, really bad day
                and I’m in bed there’s nothing I can do about it, so I just go with the
                ﬂow and I’ve done that for what 30 odd years.
                The approach to living with chronic low back pain of ‘putting
                up with it’ and‘getting on with it’ pervaded the interviews.
                While these may not be regarded as self-management
                strategies in themselves, the use of the strategies outlined
                above enabled participants to take on this approach.</sectionContent>

            <sectionTitle>Healthcare practitioners</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>
                The majority of participants with chronic low back pain hadno regular contact with healthcare professionals; however, 15
                identiﬁed that healthcare professionals played a role in their
                self-management. The duration of the healthcare practitioner
                of interviews ranged from 10 to 18 minutes.
                The nominated professionals ( n= 15) were predomi-
                nantly physiotherapists or general practitioners. It is
                important to note that most participants did not nominate
                a healthcare provider because they did not have anyone
                actively involved in the treatment of their chronic low backpain.
                Physiotherapists primarily described exercise, particularly
                those aimed at improving core strength, as the main strategy
                that they encouraged people to use:
                I have been providing exercises for her to do at home and then doing
                like a gym type programme when she comes in to try and increase herﬁtness and core strength.
                We always try and get people actively involved. Looking after
                themselves. Now that can take various forms, sometimes it’s just
                telling them what to avoid and what to do which could be a simplething such as making sure they go for a walk every day.
                Some physiotherapists expressed frustration that in some
                cases there was little they could to help the person manage the
                pain:
                You know some patients you see, you think ‘crikey’ there is nothing I
                can do, I know you feel pain yeah but there is nothing I really can see
                that is holding you back.  General practitioners (GPs) regarded themselves as primarily
                having three roles: prescription of pain medication, dispens-
                ing of sickness certiﬁcates, and referral to specialists:
                I’m just really there to prescribe analgesia so that she can manage her
                own pain.
                Giving her certiﬁcates, and sending her back to [specialist]’.
                The main sorts of things have been to coordinate the specialist
                reviews and get some, try to get some answers for him.
                Some GPs expressed frustration or cast doubt on the nature
                of the participant’s problems:
                I would probably call her sort of a victim... she tends to somatize a lot
                of her anxiety and depression. And, so she comes in a lot withcomplaints that don’t have any physiological background to them.
                Nothing seems to work. But she always comes in with multiple
                problems. So I probably didn’t do much for her.
                I think he has poor insight and poor coping skills. All is shifted onto
                health professionals.
                The main role that emerged from the interviews with
                physiotherapists emphasized exercise, while GPs described
                primarily a medication provision and gate-keeping role.</sectionContent>

            <sectionTitle>Study limitations</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>While the sample size for the people with chronic low back painwas relatively small, it reﬂected the number of people prepared
to volunteer to take part in an interview. The small sample size
for healthcare professionals interviewed reﬂected the numbers
identiﬁed as involved in their back care by participants with
chronic low back pain. Participants were predominantly New
Zealand European, which would have created cultural bias.
Recruitment bias was possible because of self-selection and
because of the sites through which the study was advertised.
There may have been other biases related to a single interviewerperforming all interviews and one analyst performing the
initial content analysis. While both the interview and analytic
processes were validated by other investigators, this may have
been a source of potential bias. Strengths of the study were the
equal distribution of sexes and the age range of participants.</sectionContent>

            <sectionTitle>Coping with low back pain</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>
                People with chronic low back pain had learned to resign
                themselves to the condition as something that could not be
                changed and which they tried to overcome. They used a fairlylimited range of self-management strategies: some recom-
                mended in clinical guidelines, although there was no evidence
                that they had been aware of this; some recommended by
                physiotherapists and to a limited extent GPs; and some
                learned through personal experience. Most participants
                recognized exercise as effective, were generally resistant to
                taking medication regularly, and found that application of
                heat relieved the pain. May (2007) also found that people
                with chronic low back pain employed strategies that came
                partly from healthcare professionals and partly from personalexperience. The approach to self-management described by
                our participants could be described as what Koch et al.
                (2004) describe as a Self-Agency Model of Self-Management,
                in that the majority did not nominate a healthcare profes-
                sional as being in a position to discuss their condition.
                Participants based their decision-making about pain man-
                agement on trial and error and previous experience. This is
                supported by Ross et al. ’s (2001) ﬁndings that patients
                frequently referred to the need to ﬁnd out for themselves whatstrategies worked, and that they were inﬂuenced by the severity
                of the pain, personal experience and self-knowledge. Profes-
                sional advice was only sought after trial and error and
                consultation with family and friends, because participants in
                the Ross et al. ’s (2001) study were somewhat sceptical about the
                prescribing practices of clinicians. Davis and McVicar (2000)
                suggested that pain in the general population is still under-
                treated due to misconceptions about pain and the pharmacology
                of pain control, and they suggested nurses may unwittingly pass
                these misconceptions on to patients and their families.
                The reluctance of our participants to use analgesics has
                also been found in other studies. Cowan et al. (2003) found
                that the under-use of analgesics, particularly opioids, was a
                major barrier to adequate pain management. They found this
                under-use could arise from exaggerated fears of adverse
                effects, including addiction, and was compounded by inad-
                equate or inaccurate knowledge of opioid pharmacology.
                Lansbury (2000) suggests that this fear is related to concerns
                over side effects and fear of loss of control or independence.
                Campbell and Cramb (2008) found, in their interviews
                with people experiencing pain from a range of chronic
                conditions but predominantly chronic low back pain, that as
                in our study, there was discontent relating to medication use
                and a similar general sense of stoicism towards the need to get
                on and manage the pain whilst avoiding formal healthcare
                providers. McIntosh and Shaw (2003) found that patients
                were generally dissatisﬁed with the information they received
                from their GPs, especially about diagnosis and treatment, and
                that they tended to access information from a variety of other
                sources; this was often contradictory, conﬂicted with research
                evidence, and led to unreasonable expectations. These patients regarded the lack of diagnostic certainty about the
                cause of chronic low back pain as associated with GPs’inability to help, assumptions by GPs that they were
                malingering, and withholding access to treatment. Our
                interviews with GPs suggested that they were making
                assumptions about the validity of the description of symp-
                toms. This probably adds to the doubt about medical
                treatment identiﬁed by Padiyar et al. (2001), who found that
                people with back pain determined the threshold at which they
                would seek healthcare intervention; however, because treat-
                ment frequently did not fully alleviate the pain or preventrepeated ﬂare-ups, they were often sceptical about it.
                An implication of our ﬁndings is that people with chronic
                low back pain do not use or seem to be aware of other self-
                management strategies recommended in the literature. The
                most common barriers to accessing self-management support
                resources were lack of awareness, physical symptoms, trans-
                portation problems and cost. None of the participants in our
                study identiﬁed the use of ‘back schools’ (education pro-
                grammes), progressive relaxation, or a multidisciplinary
                approach that might include cognitive behavioural therapy,
                massage or hydrotherapy.
                Charles et al. (1999) proposed a shared decision-making
                approach that presumes two experts: one who knows bestabout medicine and the other, who is expert in their own
                capabilities and preferences, and in the social and environ-
                mental supports for (and barriers to) the effective self-
                management of their disease. Jerant et al. (2005) found that
                depression, weight problems, difﬁculty exercising, fatigue,
                poor physician communication, low family support, pain and
                ﬁnancial problems were the most frequently noted barriers to
                active self-management. Creer and Holroyd (2006) have
                suggested that effective self-management of chronic disorders
                requires that patients: (1) possess the motivation, conﬁdenceand skills to manage their condition; (2) are effective
                problem-solvers, capable of self-monitoring and adjusting
                self-management behaviours in response to objective and
                subjective information; and (3) can successfully adapt self-
                management strategies to the constraints imposed by unique
                social and environmental factors in their daily lives. It is
                perhaps the facilitation of gaining these attributes that could
                be the focus of advanced nursing practice. This advanced
                practice role could also involve the sharing of research andclinical guidelines to enable people to make informed
                decisions about self-management.
                As identiﬁed by Kralik et al. (2004), self-management of
                chronic illness can be both a structure and a process. Generic
                approaches to the self-management situate people with
                chronic conditions as passive recipients of information.
                Approaches such as the Self-agency Model of Self-Manage-
                ment enable them to engage in a dynamic process that
                organizes knowledge gained from personal experience and
                healthcare sources to manage chronic low back pain in the
                context of their daily lives.
                Coster and Norman (2009) found in their review of
                Cochrane reviews for self-management of chronic conditions
                that assisting patients to become more knowledgeable about
                their condition, and providing them with basic skills to manage
                their condition on a day to day basis can result in physical and
                psychological patient beneﬁts and in some cases reduce their
                dependence on service use. Nursing care plays an important
                role that supplements physiotherapy and GP care by facilitat-
                ing the knowledge development about chronic low back painand strategies that may be effective in its management. Seers
                et al. (2006) suggest that the complexity of pain management
                decision-making is compounded by the subjective nature of
                pain, the necessary communication between patient and
                clinician to understand and treat the pain problem, and the
                dependent relationship promoted by the healthcare system.</sectionContent>

            <sectionContent>
                The role of nursing care for people with chronic low back
                pain is to acknowledge its presence as a primary or co-morbid condition which is potentially very disabling.
                We can work together with other healthcare professionals
                to offer a range of strategies for people with this condition.
                People with chronic low back pain utilize self-management
                strategies that they have discovered to provide relief and
