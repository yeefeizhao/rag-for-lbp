            <sectionTitle>Purpose of Program</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>After an injury or surgery, an exercise conditioning program will help you return to daily activities and enjoy a more 
                active, healthy lifestyle. Following a well-structured conditioning program will also help you return to sports and other 
                recreational activities. 
                This is a general conditioning program that provides a wide range of exercises. To ensure that the program is safe 
                and effective for you, it should be performed under your doctor’s supervision. Talk to your doctor or physical therapist 
                about which exercises will best help you meet your rehabilitation goals.
                Strength: Strengthening the muscles that support your hip will help keep your hip joint stable. Keeping these muscles 
                strong can relieve pain and prevent further injury.
                Flexibility: Stretching the muscles that you strengthen is important for restoring range of motion and preventing injury. 
                Gently stretching after strengthening exercises can help reduce muscle soreness and keep your muscles long and flexible.
                Target Muscles: The muscle groups targeted in this conditioning program include: 
                • Gluteus maximus (buttocks)
                • Gluteus medius (buttocks)
                • Hamstrings (back of thigh)
                • Piriformis (buttocks)
                • Adductors (inner thigh)
                • Abductors (outer thigh)
                • Tensor Fascia (outer thigh)
                Length of program: This hip conditioning program should be continued for 4 to 6 weeks, unless otherwise specified by 
                your doctor or physical therapist. After your recovery, these exercises can be continued as a maintenance program for 
                lifelong protection and health of your hips and thighs. Performing the exercises 2 to 3 days a week will maintain 
                strength and range of motion in your hips and thighs.

            <sectionTitle>Getting Started</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>Warm up: Before doing the following exercises, warm up with 5 to 10 minutes of low impact activity, like walking or 
                riding a stationary bicycle.
                Stretch: After the warm-up, do the stretching exercises shown on Page 1 before moving on to the strengthening 
                exercises. When you have completed the strengthening exercises, repeat the stretching exercises to end the program.
                Do not ignore pain: You should not feel pain during an exercise. Talk to your doctor or physical therapist if you have 
                any pain while exercising.
                Ask questions: If you are not sure how to do an exercise, or how often to do it, contact your doctor or physical therapist.</sectionContent>
