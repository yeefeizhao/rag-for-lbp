            <sectionTitle>Understanding the Problem</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>The changes that occur with aging can lead to problems with mobility, or a person’s ability to move around.  Mobility problems may be unsteadiness while walking, difficulty getting in and out of a chair, or falls. There are common conditions in older people that can contribute to mobility problems, such as muscle weakness, joint problems, pain, disease, and neurological (brain and nervous system) difficulties. Sometimes several mild problems occur at one time and combine to seriously affect mobility.</sectionContent>

        <section>
            <sectionTitle>The number one mobility problem that older people experience is falls</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>Falls result in broken bones, bruises, and fear of falling. Older bones break more easily than younger bones and they heal less quickly and not as completely. If a hip is fractured, canes, walkers, or wheelchairs might be needed permanently. Falls are a major cause of injury and death, so prevention is important. When an older person falls, but does not suffer serious injury, he or she might still have difficulty getting up from the fall. If the person is in serious pain, or has clearly suffered an injury, wait for help to arrive. If he or she has not been seriously injured but is having difficulty moving and getting up, he or she may be able to crawl to a solid chair and use it as a support in getting up. If the person is lying on his or her back, instruct them to first roll onto one side and then they can try to move from a side-lying position to a crawling position on all fours . If the person needs your help to get up, lift him or her with your arms by bending your legs—do not use your back muscles to lift the person. (Bend at your knees and push up with your legs.) Once the person is in an all fours position, instruct him or her to crawl towards the seat of the chair and lift the trunk of his or her body up with hands on the chair; he or she should then bring one foot up into half-kneeling position and from there either sit into the chair or stand up. If the person can't do this, you will need to call for help. An injury from a fall may result in limited or reduced mobility or even bed rest. Unfortunately, this can worsen existing medical illnesses and lead to new ones such as circulatory problems including blood clots in the legs, further loss of strength, pressure ulcers, or pneumonia.</sectionContent>

            <sectionTitle>Encourage physical activity</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>When older people have falls—even if the fall isn't serious—they often become fearful of falling again. This can lead to inactivity that can cause additional health problems. One of the most important things you can do to help someone with mobility problems and fear of falling is to encourage physical activity. Even a little activity strengthens bones and muscles, improves steadiness when walking, and helps prevent fractures. If the older person is afraid of falling, suggest using a cane or a walker. Sometimes older people are afraid they will not be able to get up from a fall. It is important to learn how to get up from a fall before the fall occurs. In some cases it can be helpful for the older person to practice getting up from the floor. A physical therapist can help with teaching a person how to do this. In addition to helping the older person stay active, you can help prevent falls and fractures by doing a home safety check and correcting conditions that could lead to falls.</sectionContent>

            <sectionTitle>Tell the healthcare provider</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>Tell the healthcare provider about mobility problems of the person you are caring for and especially mention any falls, since they can be caused by medical conditions. Drowsiness or distraction can lead to falls.  Drowsiness or distraction can be cause by worry, alcohol, or medicines such as prescription, non-prescription, or herbal or other remedies. Certain medical conditions such as poor eyesight and diseases like arthritis can also affect mobility. The risk of falling can often be reduced if the medical condition is diagnosed and treated. Your goals are to: Prevent falls by reducing hazards in the home Encourage activity/exercise to improve mobility and strength Report any recurrent falls or near falls to the healthcare provider for a medical evaluation Click on each of the topics below to read more.</sectionContent>

            <sectionContent>A useful acronym for remembering the important parts to a fall history is SPLAT: S ymptoms Did the person report pain or discomfort after the fall Did the person lose consciousness after the fall? What medicines is the person taking? Make a list of their prescription, non-prescription, herbal and other remedies. Did the person complain of lightheadedness, dizziness, weakness, chest pain, or palpitations prior to the fall? Does the person have a history of heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, stroke, Parkinson's disease, memory loss? P revious falls Has this person fallen more than once in the last few weeks? L ocation Where did the fall occur? A ctivity What was the person doing at the time of the fall? T ime What time of day did the fall occur? How long ago?</sectionContent>

            <sectionTitle>Identify fall hazards in the home and eliminate them</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>Many older people fall because of an unsafe environment at home. Use the Preventing Serious Falls tip sheet to help make sure the older person's environment is as safe as possible. Pay special attention to safety proofing the bathroom since this is where most falls occur: Put rubber appliqués or rubber mats on the tub bottom. Tubs and showers are easier to get into if side rails are added or if handrails are installed onto shower walls. A plastic chair or stool (available at a hardware or garden store) can be used in the shower, allowing the older person to sit and wash feet and legs more easily. Toilet seats can be raised and side rails attached to the toilet. In addition, special toilets that have a higher seat than standard ones can be installed by a plumber. These safety items can be purchased at medical equipment stores or through their catalogs.</sectionContent>

        <section>
            <sectionTitle>Ask the nurse or therapist for help</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>Visiting nurses, occupational therapists, or physical therapists that come to the home can identify fall hazards and make recommendations to improve safety. They can help you conduct your own home safety check or do one for you.</sectionContent>

        <section>
            <sectionTitle>Help the older person stay physically active</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>A regular program of exercise can strengthen muscles and improve flexibility. With increased strength and balance, an older person is better able to maneuver and avoid a potential fall. Some simple exercises that older people can do are included at the end of this section. Ask the healthcare provider if these exercises would be beneficial for the person you are caring for. Check with local hospitals, senior centers, and community centers to see if they offer fall prevention, exercise, or walking programs for older people</sectionContent>

        <section>
            <sectionTitle>Ask the healthcare provider about walking aids</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>A large selection of canes and walkers is available that make mobility easier and safer. Older people who use a cane should be encouraged to carry it with them at all times. If they are even a little bit unsteady on their feet, they should use a cane or walker. Some of the newer designs of walkers even come with a built-in seat, which allows the person to sit and rest when tired. Although canes and walkers can be purchased at some drug stores, it is a good idea to check with a healthcare provider to find out what type of cane or walker the older person needs. A physical therapist will make sure the cane or walker are adjusted to the right height and can teach the older person how to use it.</sectionContent>
        </section>
        <section>
            <sectionTitle>Ask the healthcare provider to check all medicines being taken</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>This includes all prescription, non-prescription and any herbal remedies.  Throw out all outdated medicines and, with the healthcare provider's assistance, try to adjust your medicine plan to make it as simple as possible. Have the older person stop taking multiple medicines that act similarly to each other.</sectionContent>
        </section>
        <section>
            <sectionTitle>Make sure vision and hearing are tested regularly and properly corrected</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>Seeing poorly or not hearing well can be a cause of mobility problems and can lead to falls. Make sure the older person is especially careful just after getting new bifocal or tri-focal eyeglasses. If the ground is out of focus on looking down through unfamiliar lenses, the chances of falling are increased.</sectionContent>
        </section>
        <section>
            <sectionTitle>Make sure proper footwear is worn</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>Sturdy, well-fitted, low-heeled shoes with wide, nonskid (rubber) soles should be worn. A walking shoe with good arch support and heel counter (rear-most part of the shoe) is recommended. Avoid slippers (unless they have non-slip soles), clogs, or sandals that can come off easily. Avoid long shoe laces, or pants that are too long which can cause tripping.</sectionContent>
        </section>
        <section>
            <sectionTitle>If the older person is afraid of falling, discuss these fears</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>People with a fear of falling will need to practice doing the things they are afraid of. Otherwise, they will not get the exercise they need and this can lead to other medical conditions such as weakened muscles and bones or blood clots in the legs. Set small goals and gradually build up the activity level. Build confidence by giving praise and encouragement, then gradually encourage being active when alone.</sectionContent>

        <section>
            <sectionTitle>Create opportunities for socializing</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>Look for community activities that will keep the older person mobile.</sectionContent>

        <section>
            <sectionTitle>Don't help the older person too much</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>Resist the temptation to do everything for the older person because you are afraid "something might happen." Older people need to stay active and like to remain independent.</sectionContent>
        </section>
        <section>
            <sectionTitle>Problems you might have carrying out your plan</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>"I don't need to do special exercises. I get enough exercise just from walking." Walking is good exercise, but the healthcare provider or physical therapist can also prescribe special exercises to prevent problems that can lead to falls. For example, a physical therapist might recommend special posture exercises that will strengthen and improve balance. A physical therapist can sometimes identify the underlying cause for balance and mobility problems and recommend specific balance-improving exercises that will reduce the risk for falling. Unless specific exercises are performed to address such problems, the problems will continue. "It's normal for older people to have decreased mobility." Significant loss of mobility is not part of normal aging. In the healthy older person it may be  more to do with inactivity. With regular exercise, strength and flexibility can be preserved for a longer time. "I'm afraid she will fall again." A certain amount of fear and respect for hazards is healthy, but too much concern may end up restricting mobility, which makes the likelihood of falling greater. To overcome this obstacle, be creative. For example, it might be easier for the older person to overcome the fear of falling by simply being with other people. Help the older person find a friend to walk with or an exercise program to join. Investigate "mall walking" if the climate is very hot in summer or cold in winter. In many places groups of seniors meet daily and walk the mall. Some shopping malls even open an hour or so early to encourage this activity. Many social contacts are made when this occurs. "I don't need a walker." Walkers can prevent falls by making mobility easier and safer. Using a walker allows the older person to continue to walk independently and not be confined to a wheelchair or admitted to a nursing home. Say to the person, "Isn't it worth it to use a walker?" "I can't afford to install the recommended safety device." Most safety changes are easy to make and are not expensive. There are volunteer organizations that can help you buy and install safety equipment. If money is a problem, ask to talk to a social worker who will advise you about financial help that may be available.</sectionContent>

            <sectionTitle>Think of other problems you might have carrying out your plan</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>What other problems could get in the way of doing the things suggested in this section? For example, will the older person cooperate? Will other people help? How will you explain your needs to other people? Do you have the time and energy to carry out this plan?</sectionContent>
        </section>
        <section>
            <sectionTitle>Be realistic about expecting change</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>A large part of your plan will be prevention. Don't be discouraged if you do not see an increased level of activity. If the older person is maintaining activity and no falls are occurring, your plan is working because you are preventing the problem from getting worse. If mobility problems are getting worse, ask the healthcare provider for help. Tell them what you have done and what the results have been.</sectionContent>

            <sectionTitle>A Few Words about Wheelchairs</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>If the older person cannot get around by foot anymore and must use a wheelchair, exercises are still very important to keep bones strong and joints flexible. The old saying still holds true: "If you don't use it, you lose it." Not all older people need to use wheelchairs full time. It can be a good idea to use a wheelchair for long distances in order to save time and to avoid fatigue. Depending on the needs of the person who will use the wheelchair, the healthcare provider or physical therapist will be able to make suggestions for the type of wheelchair to use, what features it should have, and how to use it safely.</sectionContent>
        </section>
        <section>
            <sectionTitle>The wheelchair should be a good fit</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>A wheelchair that is too wide can cause bad posture. A wheelchair that is too narrow can cause skin breakdown from rubbing against the frame of the chair. At the most, the person should have one-inch clearance on each side of the chair. When sitting in the chair, weight should be equally distributed and the trunk and limbs should be balanced. Having two to three inches between the front of the seat and the knee joint helps proper weight distribution and prevents cutting off circulation to the legs, or pressing on nerves to the legs and feet. Leg rests should clear the floor by two inches. The chair size should change if there is significant weight loss or gain. If the older person will be in the chair most of the day, consider getting good cushions. Older people can develop tendon and joint contractures when they are in a wheelchair for long periods of time. This can mean the muscles do not stretch, and can become weak. To avoid this, he or she should lie on the stomach or back with legs and back fully extended for periods of time each day. Gentle stretching exercises while in this position are helpful.</sectionContent>
        </section>
        <section>
            <sectionTitle>Consider where the chair will be used</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>If you live in a mobile home, you may need a chair with a narrower frame. A lightweight chair is easier to take in and out of a car and is best for a person who travels often. Wheelchairs can be customized and there are many accessories available. Armrests can be made to fit under a desk, leg rests can be detachable or swing away, and lap boards and trays can be used for meals. There are two types of wheels for wheelchairs: pneumatic and solid. Pneumatic wheels give a better ride and may be necessary for a very frail older person. This type of wheel requires maintenance. The solid wheels are fine if the chair is being used only in the home and not for travel. The maintenance for this wheel type is very low. Safety precautions Seat belts should be worn whenever the wheelchair is in motion. Keep the chair in good working order. Check the brakes, air in tires, and upholstery. Oil the metal joints to insure that they work smoothly and to prevent rust. When assisting someone in a wheelchair up or down a curb, first tilt the chair back on its large back wheels. Then, while balancing the chair on the large wheels, slowly lower the chair down over a curb. When going up a curb, turn the chair around (backwards) so the person in the chair is facing away from the curb. Again, slightly tilt the chair back on its large back wheels. Pull the chair up over the curb while balancing the chair on the back wheels. When putting a wheelchair into the trunk or back seat of a car or van, remove any parts that are detachable such as the cushions and leg rests. Then, fold the chair and place it on its side in the trunk, or upright if you are putting it in the back seat of a car or van. Remember to bend your legs, not your back, when lifting any heavy object.</sectionContent>

            <sectionContent>Purpose: To enhance overall health of muscles, bones, joints, circulation, heart, lungs, digestion, bowels, and mind. Walk at whatever level of ability you have. If you can walk only 50 feet, start at that level and try to increase the distance and improve your gait speed. Avoid stops and starts. If you are walking longer distances, such as a half-mile in 5 to 10 minutes, do a little stretching before starting. When finishing your walk, cool down by walking slowly, stretching, and doing a few of these exercises or your favorite ones. If you need help getting started or if you have any concerns about your health, show these exercises to your physician or nurse. </sectionContent>
