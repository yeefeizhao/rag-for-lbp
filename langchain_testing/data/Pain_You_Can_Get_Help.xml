            <sectionTitle>Acute Pain and Chronic Pain</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>There are two kinds of pain. Acute pain begins suddenly, lasts for a short time, and goes away as your body heals. You might feel acute pain after surgery or if you have a broken bone, infected tooth , or kidney stone. Pain that lasts for 3 months or longer is called chronic pain. This pain often affects older people. For some people, chronic pain is caused by a health condition such as arthritis. It may also follow acute pain from an injury, surgery, or other health issue that has been treated, like post-herpetic neuralgia after shingles. Living with any type of pain can be hard. It can cause many other problems. For instance, pain can: Get in the way of your daily activities Disturb your sleep and eating habits Make it difficult to continue working Be related to depression or anxiety Keep you from spending time with friends and family</sectionContent>

            <sectionTitle>Describing Pain</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>Many people have a hard time describing pain. Think about these questions when you explain how the pain feels: Where does it hurt? When did the pain start? Does it come and go? What does it feel like? Is the pain sharp, dull, or burning? Would you use some other word to describe it? Do you have other symptoms? When do you feel the pain? In the morning? In the evening? After eating? Is there anything you do that makes the pain feel better or worse? For example, does using a heating pad or ice pack help? Does changing your position from lying down to sitting up make it better? What medicines, including over-the-counter medications and non-medicine therapies have you tried, and what was their effect? Your doctor or nurse may ask you to rate your pain on a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being no pain and 10 being the worst pain you can imagine. Or, your doctor may ask if the pain is mild, moderate, or severe. Some doctors or nurses have pictures of faces that show different expressions of pain and ask you to point to the face that shows how you feel. Your doctor may ask you to keep a diary of when and what kind of pain you feel every day.</sectionContent>

Acetaminophen may help all types of pain, especially mild to moderate pain. Acetaminophen is found in over-the-counter and prescription medicines. People who have more than three drinks per day or who have liver disease should not take acetaminophen. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) include aspirin, naproxen, and ibuprofen. Long-term use of some NSAIDs can cause side effects, like internal bleeding or kidney problems, which make them unsafe for many older adults. You may not be able to take ibuprofen if you have high blood pressure . Narcotics (also called opioids ) are used for moderate to severe pain and require a doctor's prescription. They may be habit-forming. They can also be dangerous when taken with alcohol or certain other drugs. Examples of narcotics are codeine, morphine, and oxycodone. Other medications are sometimes used to treat pain. These include antidepressants, anticonvulsive medicines, local painkillers like nerve blocks or patches, and ointments and creams. As people age, they are at risk for developing more side effects from medications . It's important to take exactly the amount of pain medicine your doctor prescribes. Don't chew or crush your pills if they are supposed to be swallowed whole. Talk with your doctor or pharmacist if you're having trouble swallowing your pills. Mixing any pain medication with alcohol or other drugs can be dangerous. Make sure your doctor knows all the medicines you take , including over-the-counter drugs and dietary supplements , as well as the amount of alcohol you drink. Remember: If you think the medicine is not working, don't change it on your own. Talk to your doctor or nurse.</sectionContent>
