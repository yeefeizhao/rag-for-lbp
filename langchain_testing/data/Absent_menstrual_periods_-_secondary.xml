            <sectionTitle>Causes</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>Secondary amenorrhea can occur due to natural changes in the body. For example, the most common cause of secondary amenorrhea is pregnancy. Breastfeeding and menopause are also common, but natural causes.
Women who take birth control pills or who receive hormone shots such as Depo-Provera may not have any monthly bleeding. When they stop taking these hormones, their periods may not return for more than 6 months.
You are more likely to have absent periods if you:
Are obeseExercise too much and for long periods of timeHave very low body fat (less than 15% to 17%)Have severe anxiety or emotional distressLose a lot of weight suddenly (for example, from strict or extreme diets or after gastric bypass surgery) 
Other causes include:
Brain (pituitary) tumorsDrugs for cancer treatmentMedicines to treat schizophrenia or psychosisOveractive thyroid glandPolycystic ovarian syndromeReduced function of the ovaries 
Also, procedures such as a dilation and curettage (D and C) can cause scar tissue to form. This tissue may cause a woman to stop menstruating. This is called Asherman syndrome. Scarring may also be caused by some severe pelvic infections.</sectionContent>

            <sectionTitle>Treatment</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>Treatment depends on the cause of amenorrhea. Normal monthly periods most often return after the condition is treated.
A lack of menstrual period due to obesity, vigorous exercise, or weight loss may respond to a change in exercise routine or weight control (gain or loss, as needed).</sectionContent>
