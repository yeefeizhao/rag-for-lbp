WHERE REHABILITATION IS DONE
People can have rehabilitation in many settings. It will often begin while they are still in the hospital, recovering from an illness or injury. Sometimes it begins before someone has planned surgery.
After the person leaves the hospital, treatment may continue at a special inpatient rehabilitation center. A person may be transferred to this type of center if they have significant orthopedic problems, burns, a spinal cord injury or severe brain injury from stroke or trauma.
Rehabilitation often also takes place in a skilled nursing facility or rehabilitation center outside of a hospital.
Many people who are recovering eventually go home. Therapy may then be continued at your health care provider's office or in another setting, if needed. You may visit the office of your physical medicine physician and other health professionals. Sometimes, a therapist will make home visits. Family members or other caregivers must also be available to help.
WHAT REHABILITATION DOES
The goal of rehabilitation therapy is to teach people how to take care of themselves as much as possible. The focus is often on daily tasks such as eating, bathing, using the bathroom and moving from a wheelchair to a bed.
Sometimes, the goal is more challenging, such as restoring full function to one or more parts of the body.
Rehabilitation experts use many tests to evaluate a person's problems and monitor their recovery.
A full rehabilitation program and treatment plan may be needed to help with medical, physical, social, emotional, and work-related problems, including: 
Therapy for specific medical problemsAdvice about setting up their home to maximize their function and safetyHelp with wheelchairs, splints and other medical equipmentHelp with financial and social issues 
Family and caregivers may also need help adjusting to their loved one's condition and knowing where to find resources in the community.
THE REHABILITATION TEAM
Physical medicine and rehabilitation uses a team approach. Team members are doctors, other health professionals, you, and your family or caregivers.
Physical medicine and rehabilitation doctors receive 4 or more extra years of training in this type of care after they have finished medical school. They are also called physiatrists.
Other types of doctors that may be members of a rehabilitation team include neurologists, orthopedic surgeons, psychiatrists and primary care doctors.
Other health professionals include occupational therapists, physical therapists, speech and language therapists, social workers, vocational counselors, nurses, psychologists, and dietitians (nutritionists).</sectionContent>
