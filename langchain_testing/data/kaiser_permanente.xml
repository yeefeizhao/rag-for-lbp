            <sectionTitle>Background</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>Back pain is a common condition that has significant impacts on patients’ function and quality of life. Clinical approaches to back pain vary considerably among providers. This guideline is intended to help primary care teams do an effective initial assessment of back pain, select appropriate interventions to maximize the patient’s function and quality of life, and minimize the use of unnecessary and potentially harmful interventions.</sectionContent>

            <sectionTitle>Key points about back pain</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>• Most people experience back pain in their lifetime. • Most back pain is “non-specific,” with no specific identifiable spinal cause. • Back pain caused by serious or urgent (“red flag”) conditions is infrequent. • For most patients with back pain, the condition will improve within a few days or weeks. In the  absence of red flag conditions requiring immediate referral and treatment, the initial approach to  back pain should include evaluation with the STarT Back, followed by reassurance,  encouragement to stay active, emphasis on restoring function, and simple analgesics as needed. • Psychosocial factors are stronger predictors of prognosis than clinical factors.  • Biomedical interventions commonly used to evaluate and treat back pain—such as imaging,  medications, and epidural steroid injections—have been found to be of limited value and  effectiveness.  • Non-pharmacologic interventions can improve both pain and function (see page 7). • Acetaminophen is the preferred drug for initial treatment because of its stronger safety profile. • Opioids are rarely indicated for the treatment of back pain. Opioid prescriptions for acute back  pain, if made, should be limited to 3 days and followed by a check-back with the patient. The treatment and follow-up recommendations in this guideline apply to patients with non-specific back pain. Back pain caused by degenerative disk disease, herniated (“slipped”) disk, spinal stenosis, or other specific conditions is outside the scope of this guideline.</sectionContent>

            <sectionTitle>Virtual care and back pain</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>For patients with acute or subacute low back pain, there is promising evidence that virtual care in combination with usual care may be more effective than usual care alone for decreasing pain and disability and improving physical function. Virtual encounters—by phone, chat, and video—may be particularly suitable for pain assessment and counseling interventions. Evidence suggests that video physical therapy visits for low back pain assessment produce results comparable to in-person visits in defining range of motion, pain symptoms, and mobility limitations. KPWA has several virtual care tools/systems to ensure that patients seeking care for back pain receive consistent assessment, guidance, and follow-up, regardless of where they enter the delivery system. These include Back Pain E-visits, Physical Therapy video visits, and Spine Clinical RN triage phone visits.</sectionContent>

            <sectionTitle>Pain and function assessment</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>To assess patients’ pain and function, use the Pain intensity, interference with Enjoyment of life, and interference with General activity (PEG) Tool. This tool is available in KP HealthConnect as the SmartPhrase .pegscore, and as a documentation flowsheet, review flowsheet, and secure message. It is also available in hard copy. PEG Tool 1.

            <sectionContent>Based on history and physical exam, and after ruling out red-flag conditions (such as cancer, infection, or cauda equina syndrome), the vast majority of back pain cases can be diagnosed as non-specific, i.e., with no specific identifiable spinal cause.</sectionContent>

            <sectionTitle>Complexity stratification</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>Stratification assesses the likelihood that a patient’s non-specific back pain will become a high-intensity health problem by accounting for psychosocial factors—such as anxiety—as well as physical factors. The recommended tool for stratifying patients with back pain is the Keele STarT Back Screening Tool, a 9-item questionnaire. The STarT Back may be filled out by patients directly as an attachment to an outgoing secure message prior to the appointment, or entered into a KP HealthConnect documentation flowsheet by the medical assistant during patient rooming. Using the STarT Back, patients are stratified into one of three categories: low complexity, medium complexity, or high complexity. Complexity levels are not synonymous with pain severity or chronicity—for example, a patient with anxiety might be categorized as high-complexity despite having relatively mild pain, while a patient who has severe pain but is confident that it will go away might be at medium complexity—and they should not be the sole factor in determining appropriate interventions. Instead, complexity levels are most useful for: • Establishing a common language for communication between clinicians and patients • Identifying conditions that might otherwise be missed (e.g., depression, anxiety, substance  abuse)  • Incorporating the patient’s psychosocial needs into the care plan            </sectionContent>

            <sectionTitle>Treatment</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>The primary goal of treatment is to maximize function and quality of life, rather than to completely eliminate pain. Some ongoing or recurrent pain is normal and not indicative of a serious problem. Avoid exposing the patient to unhelpful or possibly risky interventions. As a general rule, an intervention in which the patient is an active participant (e.g., physical therapy, walking, stretching, yoga) rather than a passive recipient (e.g., chiropractic, massage, acupuncture) is deemed to have greater potential to promote self-efficacy and self-management skills in the long term. If using physically passive interventions, such as spinal manipulation, acupuncture, or relaxation techniques, introduce an active option within a week. Advise the patient to build strength and endurance gradually, moving naturally, avoiding guarded or bracing behavior, and focusing on low-impact forms of exercise. Advise the patient that there are many different interventions available, so patients should try numerous options until they find the one that works best for them </sectionContent>

            <sectionTitle>RECOMMENDED non-pharmacologic interventions: Education</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>Educate patients that the primary goal of treatment is to maximize function and quality of life, rather than to completely eliminate pain. Some ongoing or recurrent pain is normal and not indicative of a serious problem. Offer the shared decision-making DVD “Chronic Low Back Pain: Managing Your Pain and Your Life,” use the appropriate SmartPhrase for the patient’s level of complexity (.AVSBackPainLow, .AVSBackPainMed, or .AVSBackPainHigh), and/or recommend the patient explore the online content on low back pain on Healthwise.</sectionContent>

        <section>
            <sectionTitle>RECOMMENDED non-pharmacologic interventions: Usual activity as able</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent> Encourage the patient to stay active and carry on with normal activities— including work—as much as possible while paying attention to correct posture to minimize spine  loading. Advise the patient to temporarily limit or avoid specific activities known to increase  mechanical stress on the spine (e.g., prolonged unsupported sitting, heavy lifting, and bending or  twisting the back, especially while lifting)</sectionContent>
        </section>
        <section>
            <sectionTitle>RECOMMENDED non-pharmacologic interventions: low-impact activities</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>Encourage low-impact activities such as walking, swimming or elliptical. Walking places low  stress on the spine and is available to almost everyone. Walking helps maintain endurance and  function, and helps with pain. Recommend a gradual increase in exercise of no more than 10%  per week. Advise patients to start slow with short walks 2–3 times per day and then increase their  distance or speed every 3–5 days if there is no increase in symptoms</sectionContent>

            <sectionTitle>RECOMMENDED non-pharmacologic interventions: Self-care</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>Self-care includes staying physically active, getting enough sleep, connecting with  friends and family, eating well, managing physical and emotional stressors, and staying involved  in everyday activities. Advise the patient to identify enjoyable and meaningful activities that will  increase strength, flexibility and endurance.</sectionContent>

            <sectionTitle>RECOMMENDED non-pharmacologic interventions: Superficial heat</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>Heat may help to reduce low back pain. Advise the patient to apply heat for 15  to 20 minutes at a time. Moist heat (hot packs, baths) might work better than dry heat. If an  electric heating pad is used, advise the patient to be careful not to fall asleep while the pad is on  to avoid heat burn</sectionContent>

            <sectionTitle>RECOMMENDED non-pharmacologic interventions: Better Choices, Better Health® workshop</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>The Better Choices, Better Health web-based workshop lasts 6 weeks, but there's no set time to  participate. Participants log on for activities 2 to 3 times each week at their convenience and,  once the workshop is over, they can join an ongoing moderated self-management community,  Healthier Living Alumni, to reinforce the skills gained during the workshop. This workshop improves outcomes for patients with ongoing health conditions, including back  pain, as participants experience fewer symptoms, get more exercise, have better medication  adherence, are more active partners in their health care, and spend less time in the hospital. This  program is offered to patients free of charge. Use .avsBCBH to refer patients to the program.  Patients can register at https://enroll-kpwa1.selfmanage.org/.

            <sectionTitle>RECOMMENDED non-pharmacologic interventions: Psychotherapy</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>Consider a referral to Mental Health and Wellness. There is evidence for two  specific psychotherapies: cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for pain and mindfulness-based  stress reduction (MBSR). The evidence does not show a difference between these two  treatments. While the evidence suggests a potential long-term (> 1 year) benefit for improving  pain, it is mixed on improving function. CBT for pain is currently available, on a limited basis, at  KPWA. MBSR is not currently available at KPWA, but patients may opt to attend a communitybased MBSR program.</sectionContent>

            <sectionTitle>Non-pharmacologic interventions that are NOT recommended</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>The following interventions are not recommended due to evidence suggesting lack of benefit: • Bed rest  • Traction  Note about weight loss as an intervention: We recommend against delaying interventions for back pain  until patients lose weight, as there is no evidence that the delay improves long-term outcomes. There is  insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of weight loss in improving long-term outcomes for  back pain management. The following interventions are not recommended due to insufficient evidence to determine benefit: • Back school • Inferential therapy • Low-level laser therapy • Transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation  • Lumbar corset  • Therapeutic ultrasound • Nerve root blocks • Intra-discal electrothermal therapy  • Prolotherapy • Radiofrequency facet joint denervation • Sacroiliac joint injections • Trigger point/soft tissue injections • Discography • Kyphoplasty • Percutaneous intradiscal radiofrequency  thermocoagulation • Vertebral axial decompression for back pain</sectionContent>

            <sectionContent>Epidural steroid injections are not recommended for patients with non-specific back pain, due to a lack of evidence of the safety and effectiveness for this use. The Food and Drug Administration  (FDA) does not approve of the use of corticosteroid injections into the epidural space and in April  2014 issued a warning that this practice may result in rare but serious adverse events, including loss  of vision, stroke, paralysis, and death.

            <sectionTitle>Pharmacologic Options: Special considerations: opioids            </sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>Opioids, including tramadol, are rarely indicated for the treatment of back pain. While opioids  appear to be similarly efficacious to acetaminophen and NSAIDs, they have more risks and side effects,  including the risk of dependence and substance abuse disorder. One study (AMDG 2015) showed that of  patients who took opioids for 90 days or longer, 60 percent were still taking opioids 5 years later. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2016) recommends against prescribing opioids for  chronic back pain. See the Chronic Opioid Therapy Safety Guideline. Low-quality evidence shows that  opioids may reduce pain in patients with chronic low back pain in the short term. However, the effect is  small and not clinically important, and long-term efficacy is unknown. There is insufficient evidence to determine the effects of opioids on acute back pain. Opioid  prescriptions for acute back pain, if made, should be limited to 3 days and followed by a checkback with the patient.

            <sectionTitle>Evidence Summary</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>The Non-specific Back Pain Guideline was developed using an evidence-based process, including  systematic literature search, critical appraisal, and evidence synthesis. As part of our improvement process, the Kaiser Permanente Washington guideline team is working  towards developing new clinical guidelines and updating the current guidelines regularly. To achieve this  goal, we are adapting evidence-based recommendations from high-quality national and international  external guidelines, if available and appropriate. The external guidelines should meet several quality  standards to be considered for adaptation. They must: be developed by a multidisciplinary team with no  or minimal conflicts of interest; be evidence-based; address a population that is reasonably similar to our  population; and be transparent about the frequency of updates and the date the current version was  completed. In addition to identifying the recently published guidelines that meet the above standards, a literature  search was conducted to identify studies relevant to the key questions that are not addressed by the  external guidelines</sectionContent>

            <sectionTitle>What is the clinical effectiveness of telehealth-based interventions in the management of nonspecific low back pain?</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>A systematic review and meta-analysis (Dario 2017) of 11 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that  included adult patients with subacute, acute or chronic low back pain was reviewed. Telehealth-based  interventions were compared to usual care/minimal interventions. Length of telehealth interventions  varied from 4 weeks to 1 year. Telehealth interventions alone are not more effective than minimal  interventions in terms of pain and disability reduction in patients with chronic low back pain. However,  in patients with acute or subacute LBP, telehealth in addition to usual care may be more effective  than usual care alone for pain, disability, and physical function.  An RCT (Heapy 2017) with moderate risk of bias reported that cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)  supported by health technology (interactive voice response–based CBT) is comparable to in-person  CBT in patients with chronic LBP on the mid-term (9 months). Another RCT (Amorim 2019) with  moderate risk of bias found that the addition of telephone-based health coaching sessions (supported  by internet-based application and activity tracker) is not better (no difference) than standard of care in  chronic LBP on the mid-term (6 months). Four non-RCTs (Cottrell 2018, Palacín-Marín 2013, Peterson 2019, Truter 2013) with small sample  sizes showed high agreement between in-person and telerehabilitation evaluations for a variety of  outcomes.</sectionContent>

            <sectionTitle>What is the clinical effectiveness of antidepressants (specifically duloxetine and tricyclics) for  the treatment of acute or chronic low back pain?</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>AHRQ 2020 has been adapted: In patients with low back pain, short-term duloxetine use resulted in a  small improvement in pain severity and response, but the improvements in function and quality of life  did not meet the threshold for a small improvement, based on pooled analysis of three trials (strength  12 of evidence: moderate). In the intermediate term, a single study of amitriptyline found no improvement  in pain or function in patients with low back pain (strength of evidence: low)</sectionContent>

            <sectionTitle>What is the clinical effectiveness of anticonvulsants (specifically pregabalin) for the treatment  of acute or chronic low back pain?</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>A systematic review and meta-analysis (Enke 2018) including nine RCTs was reviewed. Most studies  compared anticonvulsants with placebo and had low risk of bias. Anticonvulsants included  gabapentin, pregabalin and topiramate. The review showed that anticonvulsants (pregabalin,  gabapentin) were ineffective for pain and disability in patients with chronic low back pain or lumbar  radicular pain in the short and intermediate terms. The risk of adverse events was higher for  anticonvulsants. Similarly, AHRQ 2020 indicated that in the short term, pregabalin/gabapentin  resulted in large increases in blurred vision, dizziness, weight gain, and cognitive effects (confusion)</sectionContent>

            <sectionTitle>What is the clinical effectiveness of muscle relaxants (cyclobenzaprine, methocarbamol,  tizanidine, baclofen) for non-specific acute and chronic low back pain?</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>No new high-quality studies comparing muscle relaxants to placebo were identified. However, two  low-quality RCTs (Friedman 2018, Friedman 2019) showed that the addition of muscle relaxants  (tizanidine, methocarbamol) to naproxen or ibuprofen does not confer additional efficacy for acute low  back pain. Friedman 2018 randomized patients to naproxen (500 mg) + placebo or naproxen +  methocarbamol (750 mg) or naproxen + orphenadrine (100 mg). The authors reported improvement  in Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ) scores in all groups with no serious adverse  events. Friedman 2019 concluded that the addition of tizanidine to ibuprofen did not confer additional  efficacy at 1 week after an ED visit for acute low back pain.</sectionContent>

            <sectionTitle>Is there evidence that losing weight improves long-term outcomes for back pain  management?</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>One low-quality RCT (Williams 2018) that assigned overweight and obese patients to lifestyle  intervention or usual care was identified. Patients were followed for 6 months. The authors found that  healthy lifestyle intervention (telephone advice, education, and referral to a 6-month telephone-based  healthy lifestyle coaching service targeting weight loss, physical activity, and diet) did not reduce pain  intensity, self-reported weight, or any other secondary outcomes. Intervention did not reduce weight.  More high-quality studies are warranted. There is insufficient direct evidence to determine the  effectiveness of weight loss in improving long-term outcomes for back pain management</sectionContent>
