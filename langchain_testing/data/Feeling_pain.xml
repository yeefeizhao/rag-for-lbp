            Pain, although often uncomfortable, is a protective mechanism that alerts us to potential or actual harm to the body's tissues.
            
            Here, the peripheral nervous system sent a pain message to the brain that a bee sting occurred on the nose.
            
            Let's take a look at an instant replay to see how this communication works.
            
            The pain receptors in the skin detect tissue damage from the bee sting. Then, the peripheral nerves send a pain signal to the brain. The brain analyzes the pain signal.
            
            Ouch!!!
            
            In turn, the brain delivers a message back to the muscles of the arm to react.
            
            Hasta la beesta, babee!
            
            As you can tell, it's a very effective system.</sectionContent>
