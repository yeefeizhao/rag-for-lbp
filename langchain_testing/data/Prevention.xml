            <sectionContent>Core Strengthening
                Many popular forms of exercise focus on core strengthening, or building the muscles that provide support for your body. Pilates, yoga and martial arts all provide well-rounded core strengthening programs. Simple exercises can be done at home as well.
                
                Some specific core strengthening exercises are described below. If any of the following suggested exercises increases your back pain after five repetitions, or causes acute pain, you should stop doing it.
                
                Transverse Core Strengthening
                This strengthens the muscles that cross from your ribs across your waist and helps support you in an upright position. Stand with feet shoulder width apart and toes turned in very slightly. Hold a ball directly in front of you. Keep your abdominal muscles tight and feet flat on the floor; rotate from side to side. Repeat 10 times. Check with your physician; if you are able to use progressively heavier balls, you will experience more benefit from this exercise...

Tighten your abdominal muscles, then reach through your legs to touch the wall, keeping hips and knees bent. Use your hips to push your body back to a standing position, then extend your arms and reach over your head and slightly backward. Repeat 10 times...

                Resistance Training
                Resistance training is exercise done against something providing resistance. It can be done with weights (hand-held or training machines) or using isometric techniques. Common household items (like small canned goods) can be used instead of hand weights. Ask your doctor or physical therapist to prescribe an exercise program that matches your abilities.
