            <sectionContent>Chiropractic is a health care profession. Chiropractors perform adjustments (manipulations) to the spine or other parts of the body.

            Heat and ice
            Electrical stimulation
            Relaxation techniques
            Rehabilitative and general exercise
            Counseling about diet, weight loss, and other lifestyle factors
            Dietary supplements
            Many people visit chiropractors for treatment of low back pain, neck pain, and headaches.</sectionContent>
