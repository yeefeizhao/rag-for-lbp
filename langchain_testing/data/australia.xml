            <sectionTitle>Low Back Pain Clinical Care Standard Quality statements: 1 Initial clinical assessment</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>The assessment of a patient with a new presentation of low back pain symptoms, with or without leg pain or other neurological symptoms, focuses on screening for specific and/or serious pathology and consideration of psychosocial factors. It includes a targeted history and physical examination, with a focused neurological examination when appropriate. Arrangements are made for follow-up based on an evidence-based low back pain pathway.</sectionContent>

            <sectionTitle>Low Back Pain Clinical Care Standard Quality statements: 2 Psychosocial assessment</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>Early in each new presentation, a patient with low back pain, with or without leg pain or other neurological symptoms, is screened and assessed for psychosocial factors that may affect their recovery. This includes assessing their understanding of, and concerns about, diagnosis and pain, and the impact of pain on their life. The assessment is repeated at subsequent visits to measure progress.</sectionContent>

            <sectionContent>A patient is advised that the goal of pain medicines is to enable physical activity, not to eliminate pain. If a medicine is prescribed, it is in accordance with the current Therapeutic Guidelines, with ongoing review of benefit and clear stopping goals. Anticonvulsants, benzodiazepines and antidepressants are avoided, because their risks often outweigh potential benefits, and there is evidence of limited effectiveness. Opioid analgesics are considered only in carefully selected patients, at the lowest dose for the shortest duration possible.</sectionContent>

            <sectionContent>Clinical care standards help support the delivery of evidence-based clinical care and promote shared decision making between patients, carers and clinicians. They aim to ensure that people receive best-practice care for a specific clinical condition or procedure, regardless of where they are treated in Australia. </sectionContent>

            <sectionTitle>Clinical care standards</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>A clinical care standard contains a small number of quality statements that describe the level of clinical care expected for a specific clinical condition or procedure. Indicators are included for some quality statements to assist healthcare services to monitor how well they are implementing the care recommended in the clinical care standard. A clinical care standard differs from a clinical practice guideline. Rather than describing all the components of care for a specific clinical condition or procedure, a clinical care standard focuses on key areas of care where the need for quality improvement is greatest. Clinical care standards aim to improve healthcare outcomes by describing key components of appropriate care, enabling: &#9632; Patients and the community to understand the care that is recommended and their healthcare choices &#9632; Clinicians to provide best-practice care &#9632; Healthcare services to monitor their performance and make improvements in the care they provide. Clinical care standards are developed by the Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care (the Commission), an Australian Government agency that leads and coordinates national improvements in the safety and quality of health care, based on the best available evidence. By working in partnership with the Australian Government, states and territories, the private sector, clinical experts, and consumers and carers, the Commission aims to ensure that the health system is better informed, supported and organised to deliver safe and high-quality care.</sectionContent>

            <sectionTitle>About the Low Back Pain Clinical Care Standard: Context</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>Low back pain is a common form of back problem that affects most people at some point in their lives.1 As well as pain, it often leads to psychological distress and poorer quality of life2-4, and is a leading cause of disability worldwide.5 In Australia, back problems are the number one cause of lost work productivity, early retirement and income poverty and a common reason for visiting emergency departments.6-12 In 2018&#8211;19, more money was spent on managing musculoskeletal disorders, including back problems, than any other category of disease, condition or injury in Australia.13 The Australian Atlas of Healthcare Variation series has identified marked variation across Australia relevant to the care of low back pain, including in: &#9632; Computed tomography (CT) of the lumbar spine14 &#9632; Opioid medicine use14,15 &#9632; Lumbar spinal surgery.14-17 The Second Australian Atlas of Healthcare Variation (second Atlas) identified a need for comprehensive Australian guidance on the early management of low back pain, based on the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guideline Low Back Pain and Sciatica in Over 16s: Assessment and management, and other relevant high-quality Australian and international evidence.16 The second Atlas recommended that the Australian guidance support appropriate early management, and ensure that patients are informed about and understand the range of treatment options available for low back pain, their risks and their likelihood of benefit.16 Improved uptake of guideline recommendations for management of low back pain has been shown to result in better patient outcomes, such as in the extent and rate of recovery and a reduced need for ongoing care.18,19 It could also lead to more judicious use of imaging; lead to more appropriate use of opioids, other medicines and invasive therapies; and ultimately mean that more patients receive high&#8209;value care.9,20-22 This clinical care standard describes the key components of care that patients should receive when they have low back pain, with or without leg pain. </sectionContent>

            <sectionTitle>About the Low Back Pain Clinical Care Standard: Scope</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>This clinical care standard relates to the care that should be received by patients aged 16 years and over who present with low back pain, with or without leg pain. It covers the early clinical assessment, management, and review and referral of people with low back pain symptoms who present with a new acute episode. Although this standard does not cover the ongoing management of chronic low back pain, it does include the early management of patients with an acute episode, recurrence or exacerbation of chronic low back pain; such patients may progress more quickly to referral and further assessment. See Figure 1 for an overview of the scope of care described in this clinical care standard. </sectionContent>

            <sectionTitle>About the Low Back Pain Clinical Care Standard: Scope (Healthcare settings)</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>This clinical care standard applies to all healthcare settings where such care is provided, especially: &#9632; Primary healthcare services &#9632; Emergency departments. The clinical care standard is of particular relevance to: &#9632; General practitioners &#9632; Allied health providers, including physiotherapists, pharmacists, psychologists, chiropractors, occupational therapists, osteopaths and paramedics &#9632; Emergency physicians &#9632; Nurses and nurse practitioners. It may also be relevant in other specialist services that provide care within the scope of this standard. Not all quality statements in this clinical care standard will be applicable to every healthcare service or clinical unit. Healthcare services should consider their individual circumstances in determining how to apply each statement. Implementation should consider the context in which care is provided, local variation and the quality improvement priorities of the individual healthcare service.</sectionContent>

            <sectionTitle>Background: Low back pain</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>About 1 in 6 Australians report having back problems, which include a range of musculoskeletal conditions related to the back.3 Low back pain is the most common form of back problem and contributes significantly to the burden of back problems and musculoskeletal pain in Australia and globally.3,5,38 This burden is increasing and is expected to continue to increase with the ageing population.1,3,5,38 Back problems are the second most common reason Australians seek care from their general practitioner7, and a leading cause of presentation to emergency departments in Australia and throughout the world.6,39 Low back pain refers to pain felt in the lower part of the spine (lumbar spine) located between the 12th rib and the inferior buttock crease.40 It is commonly accompanied by pain in one or both legs.23 Most people will have low back pain at some point in their life35,38 and more commonly during middle or older age.1,3,6,7,9-11,41 Not all people who experience low back pain will seek care42-44 as new episodes are typically brief and resolve quickly on their own.45 For people who do consult a healthcare provider, most improve rapidly with primary care management within the first six weeks of presentation, and without the need for further investigation, referral or presentation to the emergency department for care.8,9,24,40,46,47 After six weeks, recovery is slower, but most people can still achieve minimal pain and disability at one year &#8211; particularly if they present early in the acute episode for care.8 Nonetheless, recurrence is common and is responsible for much of the burden of low back pain.48,49 About one-quarter of people who initially recover from an acute episode have additional episodes within a year.49 For a small proportion of patients, low back pain can become a persistent or chronic condition that recurs episodically or remains present but with exacerbations.43 Once this occurs, management can be more challenging, with slower time to recovery.8,9,23,47-50 There is broad international consensus on the best ways to manage low back pain. Early appropriate management may reduce the risk of recurrence and progression to persistent or chronic low back pain.4,8,47-49,51,52 Guideline recommendations include: &#9632; Risk stratification to identify patients who may be at risk of a poor outcome, using a biopsychosocial model &#9632; Initial management in primary care with non- invasive treatments that focus on improving function and addressing psychosocial factors46 through self-management, including physical and psychological therapies &#9632; Limiting the use of medicines, even commonly used analgesics such as non-steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and paracetamol. For several reasons, many people do not receive guideline-recommended care.46,53 A recent systematic review of 195,000 patients across seven countries, including Australia, found that overuse of imaging and opioid medicines, and underuse of advice and information, were common in patients presenting with low back pain to primary healthcare providers and emergency departments. Specifically: &#9632; Imaging was received by one-quarter of patients with low back pain in primary care, and one-third of patients in emergency departments &#9632; Less than half overall received appropriate medicines; one-third of patients in primary care and up to two-thirds of patients in emergency departments received opioids &#9632; Only 1 in 5 patients in primary care received advice and information from their healthcare provider that aligned with guideline recommendations.54 A Canadian study also found that many patients managed in primary care did not receive adequate treatment before referral to a surgeon.

            <sectionContent>Screening for serious pathology is universally endorsed in guidelines (such as for malignancy, vertebral fracture, infection or inflammatory disorders).9 However, such pathology comprises less than 1% of cases in primary care.23,55 Use of a biopsychosocial model to inform assessment and management of low back pain without a specific nociceptive source is consistently recommended.24,26,27,46 Improved education and training in this model for assessing and managing low back pain are crucial to reducing unnecessary investigations and treatment, and improving patient outcomes.56 </sectionContent>

            <sectionTitle>Imaging</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>Although methods such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), CT and X-ray can be used to image the spine, few indications for imaging of low back pain are supported by guidelines. The routine use of imaging is discouraged unless alerting features are present and serious pathology is suspected, or it is likely to change management, because findings are often poorly correlated with symptoms.34 Incidental findings can also lead to unnecessary worry for patients, and trigger additional tests and treatment that are of little clinical value.40,46,56 To support the appropriate use of imaging in people with low back pain, as part of Australia&#8217;s Choosing Wisely initiative, five peak professional societies and clinical colleges recommend that imaging should not be performed if there are no indicators of a serious underlying cause for low back pain.57 For patients with low back pain who require imaging, the choice of method is guided by the suspected pathology.34 MRI &#8211; delivered in a specialist setting &#8211; is generally preferred because it has a better sensitivity and superior safety profile.24,34,58 Although CT and X-ray have a limited role, they may be used in the presence of alerting features and after considering the risks and benefits, if MRI is contraindicated or unavailable, or if early referral to a specialist is not possible.34,41,44,59 Concerns about the possible overuse of imaging of the lumbar spine have been expressed for some time. The first Australian Atlas of Healthcare Variation reported that, in 2013&#8211;14, the rate of Medicare Benefits Schedule&#8211;subsidised services for CT imaging of the lumbar spine was 11.8 times higher in the area with the highest rate than in the area with the lowest rate.14 Although the Atlas data do not allow assessment of the appropriateness of imaging requests, there is a clear anomaly between the rate of CT imaging and the prevalence of serious causes for low back pain. As the likelihood of diagnosing serious disease is low, the variation suggests that some people are receiving imaging that is inappropriate and of little or no diagnostic benefit, exposing people to unnecessary radiation.55</sectionContent>

            <sectionContent>Guidelines recommend education that supports self-management, and resumption of normal activities and exercise.46 Active strategies that address psychosocial factors are recommended instead of passive approaches such as bed rest and pain medicines, which are linked with worsening disability.46,56 Educating patients about addressing lifestyle factors that may exacerbate symptoms is an important part of treatment. Smoking, physical inactivity and obesity are each associated with low back pain.34 Lifestyle changes can reduce low back pain symptoms; for example, a 5% reduction in body weight has been shown to reduce the symptoms of low back pain.60 Barriers to evidence-based management include misconceptions among both the general public and clinicians about the causes and prognosis for low back pain, and the effectiveness of different treatments.56 Consistent messaging and reassurance from all clinicians involved in a patient&#8217;s care are important to dispel myths and support shared decision making. Checking the patient&#8217;s understanding of the advice and whether they feel reassured is essential. Low health literacy is a risk factor for poor health outcomes.61 Chronic, disabling low back pain disproportionately affects people with low income and limited education.23 Awareness of how patients&#8217; health literacy levels influence their ability to seek, understand and apply health information can assist clinicians to tailor patient education and communication to support self-management.</sectionContent>

            <sectionContent>Guidelines recommend pharmacological therapy as second-line therapy for low back pain after self-management and physical or psychological strategies to improve function.46 Yet a variety of medicines are commonly used for low back pain, some of which have little evidence of effectiveness. If medicines are needed, NSAIDS are recommended as first-line treatment for people at low risk of harm from NSAID use.3,47,62 Although opioid analgesics relieve severe acute pain, they are high&#8209;risk medicines that can cause significant harm, including death, and are not significantly more effective than other commonly used medicines, such as NSAIDs, for managing low back pain.63 When an opioid analgesic is considered appropriate after careful assessment of risks and benefits, immediate-release formulations for short-term use are recommended, at the lowest effective dose and for the shortest duration possible.3,15,24,47,62,64 The Third Australian Atlas of Healthcare Variation identified that the rate of opioid analgesics dispensed per 100,000 people nationally increased by 5% between 2013 and 2017.15 Concerns about inappropriate prescribing and misuse of opioid medicines have prompted a number of national responses in Australia to support harm minimisation15, including Australia&#8217;s response to the World Health Organization Global Patient Safety Challenge: Medication without Harm65 and development of the Opioid Analgesic Stewardship in Acute Pain Clinical Care Standard, supported by Australia&#8217;s Therapeutic Goods Administration.66</sectionContent>

            <sectionContent>The first, second and fourth editions of the Australian Atlas of Healthcare Variation identified marked differences in hospitalisation rates for lumbar spine surgery in people aged 18 years and over.14,16,17 Further analysis of the reasons for this variation is required; however, potential contributing factors suggested in the atlases included uncertainty about adherence to guideline recommendations for the early management of low back pain in primary care, and a lack of access to models of care encouraging self-management and a multidisciplinary approach. Better use of guidelines, including the assessment and management of psychosocial factors and optimal use of non-surgical treatment options, may prevent deterioration in pain and function for patients with low back pain, while improving access to care for patients most likely to benefit from surgery.21,67 For example, this may include spinal decompression for people with low back pain and leg pain for whom non-surgical treatment has not improved pain or function.24 </sectionContent>

            <sectionTitle>Quality statement 1 &#8211; Initial clinical assessment: What the quality statement means For patients</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>If you see a clinician about your low back pain, they will ask: &#9632; About your pain &#9632; How it is affecting your daily activities &#9632; How it is making you feel &#9632; About your previous health issues and background. This will help them to understand your needs and goals for your care.40 Your clinician will examine you and check for signs of serious health issues, and may refer you for further tests or investigations if necessary. However, even though back pain can feel bad and interfere with your life, serious causes are very rare (less than 5% of cases).23 If a serious underlying problem is unlikely, low back pain can be treated with simple measures because the pain will get better on its own over time. It is often not possible or necessary to identify an exact cause for low back pain, and it can still be treated even if the cause is not known.34 If you have leg pain, this can be nerve-related pain &#8211; commonly called &#8216;radicular pain&#8217;, &#8216;sciatica&#8217; or &#8216;referred&#8217; pain &#8211; which starts somewhere in your back but is felt in your legs.11 For most people, this is managed the same way as low back pain. You and your clinician should discuss what follow-up you may need. You may need further visits to check on your symptoms and wellbeing, and to adjust your treatment if necessary. See your clinician urgently if new symptoms appear, such as problems with controlling urine or bowel movements, or numbness or weakness in your legs, back or genitals. </sectionContent>

            <sectionTitle>Quality statement 1 &#8211; Initial clinical assessment: What the quality statemetn means For clinicians</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>Early assessment should include a targeted history of symptoms, including attention to the pain, past history, functional capacity and alerting features for specific and/or serious pathology (see Table 1).9 Consider differential diagnoses &#8211; for example, nephritis, colitis, hip osteoarthritis and aortic dissection. Physical examination should include a postural assessment, bony and soft tissue palpation for tenderness and tone, and movement assessment for range and associated pain. A physical examination supports diagnosis and can help to build the patient&#8217;s confidence in the therapeutic relationship.9,22,28,29,31 Consider using an evidence-based low back pain pathway that guides the appropriate assessment of patients who present with low back pain symptoms. The pathway should incorporate screening for specific and/or serious pathology. It should allow the use of validated tools, such as the Brief Pain Inventory (short form)70 or the Clinically Organized Relevant Exam (CORE) Back Tool71, to aid assessment and monitoring of the patient&#8217;s progress.40 It should also allow referral to specialist clinicians, when needed, for management. For acute leg pain without severe or progressive motor weakness, initial management should be the same as for acute low back pain.9,34 For patients with low back pain symptoms and/or leg symptoms where there is clinical suspicion of neurological impairment, include a focused neurological examination with straight leg raise, deep tendon reflexes, and strength and sensation testing.72 Arrange appropriate investigation or intervention if alerting features of specific and/or serious underlying pathology are identified. The presence of multiple alerting features is associated with a greater likelihood of serious pathology compared with the presence of a single alerting feature.34 Emergency assessment or referral is indicated for clinical signs of spinal nerve root compression or spinal cord compression with rapidly progressive neurological signs or symptoms33, suspected spinal infection or cauda equina syndrome, spinal tumour, trauma or fracture.,9 Determine the most likely diagnosis&#8224;,11,72, document the assessment findings and communicate them to the patient. Arrange follow-up for monitoring or further assessment. Reassess at subsequent visits to check for symptom progression or any new concerning features that need urgent investigation or specialist assessment (refer to Quality statement 8 &#8211; Review and referral).35,40</sectionContent>

While the pain can be severe the good news is that most acute episodes of low back pain settle within a couple of weeks. In the meantime, there are a lot of things you can do to help reduce and manage your low back pain.&#8217; For a patient with low back pain with leg pain Explain how low back pain and leg pain may be related and what can be done &#8211; for example: &#8216;The pain going down your leg suggests the pain may be coming from a nerve in your spine. This is called radicular pain or sciatica. Radicular pain is thought to involve irritation or compression of one or more nerves in your spine. This can get better over time.</sectionContent>

These might include: &#9632; Your general mood &#9632; Your understanding about what is causing your pain and what you can do about it &#9632; Other factors in your life such as financial, family or work issues that may be causing you distress40 &#9632; The impact the pain is having on your life (such as sleep). Your clinician may ask you about such issues to understand how they relate to your pain.40 They may use questionnaires to help understand how your pain is affecting your life, and to help identify the best treatment and support for you. For example, you might not be able to change factors causing distress, but you can learn ways to reduce their impact on you, which can also help with your pain.

            <sectionContent>Inform the patient of the effect that pain can have on the body and the mind &#8211; for example: &#8216;The experience of pain affects both body and mind, so treatments targeted at both factors can reduce pain and disability more than medical care alone.56 Back pain does not usually mean your back is badly damaged. It means it is sensitised. The brain acts as an amplifier: the more you worry and think about your pain, the worse it can get.</sectionContent>

            <sectionContent>In most cases of low back pain, an imaging test such as an X-ray, a CT (computed tomography) scan or MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) is not necessary. These tests are usually only needed when your clinician needs to rule out a serious cause for your back pain. It is important to remember that more than 95% of low back pain cases do not have serious underlying causes. Your clinician will talk to you about the role of imaging in your situation. Unless there is a good reason, it is best to avoid scans because they are unlikely to find the reason for your pain or change how it is treated. Scans can often show changes that are normal for your age and may not be causing your pain, such as: &#9632; Disc degeneration &#9632; Facet joint changes &#9632; Disc bulges &#9632; Disc protrusions. Changes such as these are also found on the scans of people who do not have low back pain. Knowing about these changes may worry you and can lead to further tests, consultations or treatments that do not help your back pain. Scans can also be expensive and inconvenient, and some can expose you to radiation.</sectionContent>

            <sectionContent>A patient without alerting features for serious underlying pathology may not receive any clinical benefit from diagnostic imaging (see Table 1 in Quality statement 1).,28,40 Explain that investigations are rarely helpful or indicated for low back pain. Explain that imaging outside recommendations can create unnecessary concerns and that incidental findings with no clinical significance can lead to unnecessary tests (see Table 2). Early imaging is appropriate for a patient with alerting features for specific and/or serious underlying pathology (see Table 1); consider specialist involvement to obtain guidance and appropriate imaging studies.9,28,40,82 MRI is generally preferred because it offers better sensitivity and a superior safety profile. However, it is not covered by the Medicare Benefits Schedule if requested by a general practitioner, a physiotherapist or a chiropractor.83 CT has a limited role but in the presence of alerting features may be considered in some cases, such as when MRI is unavailable or contraindicated, or early consultation with a specialist is not available.59 Figure 2 outlines appropriate imaging decisions. Ensure that sufficient detail is included on the radiological referral, such as the provisional diagnosis and the clinical question being asked, to ensure appropriate imaging and reporting (see Box 2), and discuss any risks of radiation exposure with the patient. Ensure that the patient understands the radiological findings. When no serious pathology is found, discuss the report in the context of history, examination and other investigations. Patient interpretations of imaging findings can lead to unnecessary distress and fear- avoidance behaviour.34,35 Advise the patient that findings such as disc degeneration; facet joint arthritis; and disc bulges, fissures and protrusions are very common in people without pain and are usually a normal feature of ageing (see Table 2).76 Epidemiological reporting of imaging findings may help patients understand the probability and significance of incidental findings. The need for imaging should be reassessed for patients with changing or worsening symptoms.28 Patients with unchanged symptoms should not undergo repeated imaging unless a diagnosis that was not considered on previous imaging is being contemplated.15,28 </sectionContent>

            <sectionContent>&#9632;NPS MedicineWise has produced a consumer fact sheet outlining the reasons why scans are not necessary or advised for patients with low back pain. Providing the resource and discussing it may help to reassure the patient and reinforce the decision not to refer for imaging. It is important to check whether the patient feels reassured. &#9632;The presence of radicular leg pain alone is not considered a serious pathology in the absence of severe or progressive neurological deficits.34 Although imaging can sometimes identify the cause of neuropathic pain, it should only be done if it will change management.35 &#9632;Indications for imaging should be reassessed for patients with changing or worsening symptoms.28 Do not repeat imaging for a patient with no change in symptoms, unless it is to assess a diagnosis not previously considered.28 </sectionContent>

            <sectionContent>For a patient with acute low back pain Explain to the patient why imaging is not recommended &#8211; for example: &#8216;Imaging is used mainly to rule out anything serious, but otherwise it is not very good for identifying the cause of your pain. From what I can see, I&#8217;m not concerned that you have any of the serious causes of low back pain, so there is no need for any scans at this stage. In fact, imaging shows up changes that occur normally with age, even in people without back pain, so the findings are often not very helpful.&#8217; For a patient with new-onset low back pain with radicular pain Explain to the patient why imaging is not recommended &#8211; for example: &#8216;Because a lot of people with radicular pain improve rapidly, there is no need for us to do a scan right now. If we need to, we can reconsider this at our next review. We would only use imaging if your pain continues or gets worse, or if there are signs of pressure on the nerves in your back that might indicate the need for further investigation and referral.</sectionContent>

            <sectionContent>1.	 Do I really need this test, treatment or procedure? Tests may help you and your doctor or other healthcare provider determine the cause of the problem. Treatments, such as medicines, and procedures may help to treat it. 2.	 What are the risks? Will there be side effects of the test or treatment? What are the chances of getting results that aren&#8217;t accurate? Could that lead to more testing, additional treatments or another procedure? 3.	 Are there simpler, safer options? Are there alternative options to treatment that could work? Lifestyle changes, such as eating healthier foods or exercising more, can be safe and effective options. 4.	 What happens if I don&#8217;t do anything? Ask if your condition might get worse &#8211; or better &#8211; if you don&#8217;t have the test, treatment or procedure right away. 5.	 What are the costs? Costs can be financial, emotional or a cost of your time. Where there is a cost to the community, is the cost reasonable or is there a cheaper alternative? </sectionContent>

            <sectionContent>Do not wait for all the pain to be gone before you start moving.90 Staying active and continuing daily activities as normally as possible (including work) leads to the most rapid and complete recovery.11 Your clinician will encourage you to stay active and continue or quickly get back to normal activities, including exercise and work, wherever possible.91 If your pain is worse after activity and persists, you may be advised to take things a little easier at first and gradually build up over a few days or weeks.90 Avoid long periods of bed rest, which can slow down recovery.34,91 Try to remain at work, or get back to work as soon as possible. Your clinician will suggest ways for you to manage your pain and can develop a self&#8209;management plan with you, so you know what to do. Things that you do yourself to control your pain (like pacing yourself when carrying out physical activity) are more likely to help than treatments that are done to you (like medicines, massage or surgery). Refer to the patient information sheet How to manage your back pain for things that you can do. You will be encouraged to set treatment goals.91 Your clinician can also discuss monitoring your symptoms; pacing (or spreading out) activity into small, regular periods40; relaxation techniques; and exercise routines and activities.82 If activities or treatments in your self&#8209;management plan make your pain worse, talk to your clinician about other strategies you can try. Continue with physical activity even after your back pain has improved, because this is important for preventing future episodes.</sectionContent>

            <sectionContent>Explain the importance of maintaining or quickly returning to normal activities, including physical activity and a graded return to work and/or other meaningful activity (see Box 4).9,24-26,29,34 Listen to the patient, and validate that their thoughts and feelings are understandable, and the pain they are experiencing is real (see Quality statement 2 &#8211; Psychosocial assessment).77 Discuss strategies to support the patient to continue to engage or quickly re-engage socially. Prolonged bed rest is harmful and should be discouraged.34 Consider the impact of lifestyle factors that are associated with occurrence of low back pain episodes, such as smoking and obesity.34 Encourage patients to take control of their condition by following advice about ways to self- manage their back pain symptoms.14 Assess the patient&#8217;s confidence and ability to engage in self-management, particularly for patients with a history of recurrent back pain and identified psychosocial risk factors. Where potential barriers appear to exist for the patient to undertake self-management and active strategies, discuss strategies to overcome them. Self-management will differ for each patient depending on their history, pain severity and confidence to undertake self-management. A self-management plan may vary from brief advice to a more detailed management plan, according to the needs of the patient, and may include: &#9632; Prioritising active management strategies (such as physical activity, social connection, healthy sleep habits and use of heat) over passive strategies (such as pain medicines, activity avoidance and massage)28,35 &#9632; Gradually increasing activity levels by using pacing to prevent overexertion followed by inactivity &#8224;,35 &#9632; Supporting the patient to set SMART (specific, measurable, achievable, realistic and time&#8209;bound) goals that are important to them.35 If physical activity causes the patient&#8217;s symptoms to spread (pain or other symptoms radiating to the leg), activity limitation but not cessation may be required.29,40 </sectionContent>

It can improve pain relief and the ability to perform everyday activities (functional state), reduce sick leave and enable people to continue or return to work. Precautions Patients can be advised to reduce, alter or modify certain painful activities (for example, lifting) for a few days, as certain activities may exacerbate back pain. Patients need to be reassured that an exacerbation of pain is not an indication of damage, and fluctuations in pain can be expected during recovery from acute low back pain. Patients should feel confident to continue or get back to their normal everyday activities in days to weeks. Description Staying active means continuing with normal daily activities as much as possible, including going to work. It also means trying to reduce long periods of inactivity. No specific exercise(s) is needed at this stage. People with low back pain who remain active, even when in pain, do better in the long term. In fact, it appears that the longer a person stays in bed because of low back pain, the worse their ability to work or return to work becomes. Tips and challenges Patients should be advised that it is important not to wait for all pain to be gone before they start moving. Having a strategy whereby they either reduce or alter certain painful activities (for example, lifting) for a few days, and then gradually build up these activities again can be recommended. Patients often fear that pain is a sign of deterioration and/or further damage. They are often anxious about returning to physical work or activities that are high impact or involve bending, twisting or lifting. Patients may need to be reassured that the back is strong and, although they may need to reduce, alter or modify how they do these activities, they can still do them. They may also need reassurance that the pain is likely to subside and that ongoing pain is not an indication of further damage. </sectionContent>

            <sectionContent>There is often confusion about what &#8216;staying active&#8217; means. It means different things to different patients. Staying active does not mean undertaking any particular activity, and does not mean resting.90 Explain to the patient why staying active is important &#8211; for example: &#8216;The pain does not mean you are undergoing serious damage. Remember that your back is strong. Movements may be painful at first, like an ankle sprain, but they will get better as you gradually get active again. It is likely that you will experience some pain with activity, but that does not mean that your back is getting worse or that your spine is damaged.&#8217;34 Advise the patient on the importance of continuing or returning to work &#8211; for example: &#8216;Staying at or getting back to work as you are able, even part-time at first, will also help you recover. By working together with your employer and healthcare team, you are more likely to recover and avoid the problems associated with taking a lot of time off work.</sectionContent>

            <sectionContent>Your clinician will offer information and support based on your individual needs, values and preferences, and discuss your goals for improved function and mobility.40 For many people with new back pain, additional therapies are not necessary because the pain will improve naturally as you follow the advice of your clinician about physical activity and self&#8209;management. To avoid ongoing issues, treatments that target both the mind and the body will be considered because they are more likely to help with reducing your pain and improving your function long term.56 You may be referred to other clinicians for physical therapy, psychological pain management support or a combined treatment approach. Although hands-on therapies may be offered, the overall goal should be to support you to manage your symptoms independently in the longer term. There are many types of clinicians who can help you to set achievable movement and exercise goals, and show you how to pace your activities. For some people with repeated episodes, a psychologist or counsellor can also help you to understand your pain and how it affects your body, thoughts and behaviours, and help you to develop effective coping strategies. Your general practitioner may be able to advise about options for receiving Medicare rebates for these services, if you meet the criteria. You should always receive strategies that support you to manage your symptoms independently in the longer term.</sectionContent>

            <sectionContent>Use the findings from the psychosocial assessment (see Quality statement 2 &#8211; Psychosocial assessment) to determine the complexity and intensity of support the patient may need.24 For patients with few psychosocial risk factors, who are likely to improve quickly, consider simpler and less intensive support such as reassurance, guidance on self-management and advice to keep active (see Box 4 in Quality statement 5).24 Offer a review at one to two weeks to assess recovery and the need for further physical or psychological interventions.47 For patients at higher risk of a poor outcome, consider early referral for physical and/ or psychological therapies.9,24,35 A patient with moderate to high levels of distress who has difficulty overcoming fear of movement or changing their beliefs or behaviours may require more specific psychological interventions, such as cognitive behavioural therapy, progressive relaxation or mindfulness-based stress reduction.11,24,26,27,35,46 A cognitive behavioural approach can help the patient to develop adaptive coping strategies to self&#8209;manage their pain.9 Where possible, refer patients to a clinician who has experience in pain management and understands the biopsychosocial factors that influence it.35 Assess and resolve any concerns the patient may have about such a referral.25 For patients with an acute exacerbation of persistent or chronic low back pain, advise that physical activity and exercise therapy can help to relieve pain and improve function (see Box 5), and check adherence to, and effectiveness of, any previous physical and psychological treatments.9,23,25,26,29,34,35,90 Since the evidence does not show that one form of exercise is superior, exercise should be individualised to the patient&#8217;s activity preferences, beliefs and functional impairment.,34 The effects of treatment should be documented, with attention to objective and functional improvements.92 Advise the patient they may be eligible for Medicare rebates as part of a GP Management Plan and Team Care Arrangements.93 Physical therapies (such as heat wraps and massage)26 may also help to improve function and mobility26,28,30, but only as part of a treatment package including physical activity, with or without psychological therapy, and only for a short period of time.23,24,40</sectionContent>

These might include water- based walking, land-based walking, gentle swimming and floor stretches that encourage the spine to move in its normal planes. Activity should be graded by the duration of time spent exercising, rather than the pain experienced &#9632; As the patient&#8217;s tolerance to activity over longer periods increases, the mode, frequency and/or intensity of activity can be progressed &#9632; Functional exercises can be introduced to encourage activation of large muscle groups (for example, squats, lunges, step-ups) &#9632; Exercise that patients enjoy (for example, yoga, Pilates, walking, cycling) can be gradually introduced (for example, start at 15&#8211;20 minutes duration and then increase) &#9632; In the later stages of rehabilitation, more dynamic and higher-load exercises can be performed.</sectionContent>

            <sectionContent>Psychological techniques are an important component of acute and chronic pain management. For patients with acute low back pain, brief assessment may be adequate. Psychological intervention can assist with treatment adherence and reduced analgesic use.35 For patients with chronic low back pain, a comprehensive assessment of psychosocial impact and contributors is required. Psychological intervention is a first-line management strategy that may improve function, quality of life, treatment adherence and mood.35 There are a range of physical and psychological therapies, but not all are effective or relevant for low back pain. For example, electrotherapies such as ultrasound and laser are often not effective. If your patient has not responded to a therapy, clarify what treatment they received and what it entailed.</sectionContent>

            <sectionContent>Sensitive and motivational communication builds health literacy about low back pain and empowers patients to take an active role in their care, rather than relying on passive treatments. Explain that experience of pain affects both body and mind, and so treatments targeted at both factors can reduce pain and disability more than medical care alone.56 When referring a patient for psychological intervention, emphasise that the use of psychological techniques does not mean that they have a suspected psychological illness, or that their pain is not real or not being taken seriously. Instead, describe pain as a complex problem that requires a multidimensional approach. This is particularly important for patients with chronic pain.35</sectionContent>

            <sectionContent>The aim of taking medicines is to reduce pain enough to help you stay active, rather than to completely stop the pain. Medicines are only one part of pain management. They are most effective in the short term to help get you moving and support you while you learn active self-management strategies. It is important to remain physically active and continue with physical activity and self-management strategies after you start any medicine.40 When suggesting a medicine, your clinician will consider your symptoms, any other conditions you may have, other medicines you take and your treatment preferences. They will explain: &#9632; What the medicine is for &#9632; How much to take &#9632; How long to take it for &#9632; The expected benefits and risks, including possible side effects. Ask questions to decide if the medicines being suggested are right for you, and to make sure you understand how to use them. Medicines that are generally not recommended for low back pain include benzodiazepines (sometimes prescribed as muscle relaxants), anticonvulsants (also used to treat epilepsy) and antidepressants. This is because these medicines are not very effective for low back pain and can have significant side effects.82 Opioid analgesics should only be used short term at the lowest dose that helps your symptoms and as recommended by your clinician. Do not use these for long periods because they can cause significant side effects and can be addictive.35 </sectionContent>

            <sectionContent>Explain that the goal of pain medicines is to reduce pain to support continuation of usual activities, including physical activity and work, rather than to eliminate pain.34 Offer information on how pain medicines may be combined with physical activity and self&#8209;management strategies to help the patient improve their function and mobility.40 If a pain medicine is being considered: &#9632; Discuss the patient&#8217;s individual expectations, preferences, comorbidities, needs and treatment goals40,53 &#9632; Review the patient&#8217;s current medicines, including use of over-the-counter medicines, and previously prescribed medicines used to manage pain &#9632; Provide information about the risks and benefits associated with specific pain medicines40, including the potential for dependency and how to manage side effects35,53 &#9632; Prescribe the lowest effective dose for the shortest possible time in line with current Therapeutic Guidelines,34,35 &#9632; Establish and document clear stopping goals34,35 &#9632; Encourage the patient to continue other self-management strategies after they start the medicine40 &#9632; Review early and frequently to assess and monitor the effectiveness of the treatment, adverse effects, misuse and functional gains. Evidence has shown that anticonvulsants (pregabalin and gabapentin), tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and benzodiazepines have no or limited effectiveness in reducing low back pain or disability, and have significant risks.94,95 Opioid analgesics have limited evidence of short-term effectiveness. In addition to side effects such as constipation and somnolence, they carry the risk of overdose and dependency, and can prolong the time to recovery.82,94,96 If opioid analgesics are used for severe acute pain &#8211; for example, in patients who present to the emergency department &#8211; prescribe immediate-release formulations on a limited trial basis for a defined duration, as part of an overall pain management strategy that takes into account the patient&#8217;s opioid status.&#8224;,34 Before prescribing an opioid analgesic, it is essential that the patient and anyone involved in their care understand how to use these medicines safely35, including their correct storage and disposal (see Opioid Analgesic Stewardship in Acute Pain Clinical Care Standard).</sectionContent>

            <sectionContent>For patients with acute low back pain Advise the patient on immediate and follow-up actions &#8211; for example: &#8216;For now, I suggest you stay as active as you can and try things like heat wraps to help with the pain. We can reassess whether you need medicines to help manage your pain at our next review. How do you feel about that approach?&#8217; For a patient with new-onset low back pain with leg pain (without neurological signs) Advise the patient on your recommendations and approach &#8211; for example: &#8216;I recommend you try some gentle exercise to keep you from stiffening up, and we will monitor your progress closely.&#8217; &#8216;If we need to, we could try a short course of anti&#8209;inflammatory medicines (like ibuprofen) afterwards. This may help a little bit with low back pain, but has not been tested for leg pain. These medicines also have potential side effects and may not be suitable for everyone.&#8217; &#8216;Most of the medicines used for managing low back pain (including drugs for nerve pain and opioid analgesics) do not have strong evidence that they are effective. All of these medicines have potential significant side effects, so it would be best not to use them routinely. If we need to use them, we need to do so very carefully and on a short-term trial basis only.&#8217; &#8216;If the pain becomes unbearable, we can discuss other options. How would you feel about that approach?&#8217; For patients with an acute exacerbation of persistent low back pain Inform the patient of the latest research on non-drug options for low back pain &#8211; for example: &#8216;Nowadays, non-drug options are preferred over pain medicines to manage persistent low back pain. Non&#8209;drug options like exercise programs and psychological approaches are effective for managing pain, and have fewer risks and side effects. How would you feel if we started on one of those approaches? How would you feel if we tried to replace some of the medicines you are taking with one of those approaches? We can review how it is going and discuss your medicine options within the next 2&#8211;4 weeks.&#8217;</sectionContent>

            <sectionContent>If the patient&#8217;s pain is persisting or worsening on review, assess if the lack of improvement relates to progression of their condition, or physical, functional or psychosocial factors.34 Review the initial assessment and current management program, including psychosocial factors that may delay recovery, medicines and adherence to self-management strategies, and adjust the treatment plan accordingly. Any treatments trialled should be assessed for efficacy, and ineffective treatments should be discontinued rather than accumulated.26 Discuss ongoing compensation or legal actions that may affect a patient&#8217;s response to treatment, because there is an association between compensation-related factors and poorer physical and psychological function.98 For a patient with disabling low back or leg pain, or significantly limited function on review at 2&#8211;6 weeks29, consider referral to a healthcare provider with expertise in using evidence- based approaches to support functional improvement9,29,34,72 (see Quality statement 6 &#8211; Physical and/or psychological interventions). A multidisciplinary team approach should be used to address both physical and psychosocial barriers to recovery when required. This should include a mechanism for regular shared communication between healthcare providers and ensuring that consistent information is provided to a patient receiving care from multiple clinicians.9,29,34 Referral to a multidisciplinary chronic pain management program or clinician with appropriate expertise should be considered for patients with recurrent or persistent low back pain, or any patient who has not recovered from the acute episode by 12 weeks.9 These services can provide more intensive treatment to support resumption of pre-back pain activities. They have improved function and self-management as the main objectives, and allow ongoing regular review of the patient so that care can be modified according to the patient&#8217;s condition.9,28,34,62,99 Earlier referral or review may be warranted for patients with an acute exacerbation of chronic back pain, or when it is clear that pain is persisting or worsening despite appropriate early intervention.9,72 Any new concerning features (for example, serious pathologies, neurological deficits) require urgent investigation or specialist assessment (see Table 1 in Quality statement 1). Patients with severe or progressively deteriorating neurological signs and symptoms should be immediately referred for urgent imaging and surgical review (see Box 6 for essential history to be included in the referral).</sectionContent>

            <sectionTitle>Glossary Term: biopsychosocial (also known as sociopsychobiomedical) framework</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>Definition: A framework that helps clinicians understand the complexity of their patient&#8217;s pain experience, and lays a foundation for assessment and more effective pain management. The way a person processes nociceptive signals in their brain, and their resulting pain experience, depends on their developmental stage (for example, infancy, adolescence, adulthood), the social and cultural context (socio-), their emotional state (psycho-) and their biological health (-biomedical). A biopsychosocial approach considers the bidirectional relationship between these factors and the person&#8217;s pain experience to determine strengths, and areas that may need support during management.35</sectionContent>
