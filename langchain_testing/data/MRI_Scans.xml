            <sectionTitle>Summary</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) uses a large magnet and radio waves to look at organs and structures inside your body. Health care professionals use MRI scans to diagnose a variety of conditions, from torn ligaments to tumors. MRIs are very useful for examining the brain and spinal cord.
            
            During the scan, you lie on a table that slides inside a tunnel-shaped machine. Doing the scan can take a long time, and you must stay still. The scan is painless. The MRI machine makes a lot of noise. The technician may offer you earplugs.
            
            Before you get a scan, tell your doctor if you :
            
            Are pregnant
            Have pieces of metal in your body. You might have metal in your body if you have a shrapnel or bullet injury or if you are a welder.
            Have metal or electronic devices in your body, such as a cardiac pacemaker or a metal artificial joint</sectionContent>
