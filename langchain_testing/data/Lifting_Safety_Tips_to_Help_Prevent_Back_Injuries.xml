            <sectionContent>Back injuries are common at work, home, and play. They can be caused by
                accidents or improper lifting technique. Below are tips to lift safely and avoid
                back injuries.</sectionContent>

            <sectionContent>Before you start lifting, assess the object(s) you’re about to lift. A
                small size does not always mean a light load. Test the load by pushing on it lightly
                with your hands or feet. How easy it moves tells you how heavy it is. It’s important
                to make sure the objects are packaged well. The load’s weight needs to be balanced
                so it doesn’t move around. Unbalanced items can come loose when you lift and cause
                an accident. Look around before you lift. There should be a clear path for you to
                carry your object. You also should know where you are going to put it down. Avoid
                walking on slippery, uneven surfaces while you’re carrying something. The best way
                to pick up a load is to use handles or straps, if possible. Make sure you have an
                easy and tight grip before you lift. Using work gloves may help with this. You also
                should be close to the load you’re going to lift. Avoid reaching out for an object.
                This reduces strain on your muscles. Use your arms, legs, and core body (abdominal
                muscles) to lift. Don’t use your back. This includes bending your knees to pick up
                something, instead of bending over at your waist. Maintain proper posture. Don’t
                arch your back. This is one way to cause an injury by using the wrong muscles.
                Another way to avoid hurting your back is to use a ladder when lifting something
                overhead. It’s best to use slow and smooth movements to lift. Once you have your
                load, carry it straight on, instead of to one side. Quick, jerky, or twisted
                movements can pull your muscles. The most important tip is don’t lift something that
                is beyond your strength. This is when most people have problems. They ignore their
                gut instincts that tell them to find another way to accomplish the move.</sectionContent>

            <sectionTitle>Things to consider</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>In addition to proper technique, warm up before lifting. Know your
                limits, and don’t overdo it. Don’t carry too much in one load or setting. The
                correct weight is often less you than think. Don’t carry something that is too
                heavy. Try using a dolly or forklift or asking others for help. Daily stretches and
                exercise also can strengthen your back muscles. Exercising your core muscles is
                especially helpful. This prepares you in advance for lifting objects. Do not rely on
                a back support belt to protect you. There is no proof that these prevent back
                injuries. Last but not least, pace yourself. Take breaks between lifting to give
                your muscles a chance to rest and heal.</sectionContent>
