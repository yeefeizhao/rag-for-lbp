            <sectionTitle>INTRODUCTION</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent> Low back pain (LBP) is a common musculoskeletal disorder experienced by adults of all ages ( 1). In the US, more than 55% of adults report back pain in the past year ( 2). LBP is the primary cause of restricted activity, sickness absence, loss of work productivity and reduced quality of life worldwide, resulting in high healthcare costs for individuals, families, and society ( 3). Chronic low back pain (CLBP) accounts for a majority of the dysfunction and expenses associated with LBP. The annualtotal direct cost per patient with CLBP in the US is $8,386 ( 4). Studies have shown that exercise can relieve LBP ( 5–7). The risk factors for LBP are multifactorial, including hereditary factors, physical risk factors (such as gender, age and history of a back injury), psychological factors (such as long-term mental stress, anxiety and fear of activities that indicate bodily harm or pain) and unhealthylifestyle (such as alcohol drinking and smoking) ( 8,9). Recently, the interrelationships between pain, cigarette and smoking have received considerable attention because of their prevalence, public health consequences and serious comorbidities. More than two-thirds of Americans with chronic pain support lifelong nicotine use ( 11). People with chronic pain likely smoke more than the general population ( 12). Furthermore, recent estimates suggest that nearly 60% of people who are addicted to tobacco meet the criteria for chronic pain ( 13). Previous research has shown that smokers and those who have quitsmoking tend to experience more widespread and severe painthan non-smokers ( 14). Smoking has been linked to headaches, trunk pain and pain in the extremities ( 15,16). Despite the increased likelihood of generalized pain, studies have found a strong relationshipbetween spinal pain and smoking ( 16). Current and previous heavy smoking are associated with the amount and intensity ofpain sites, that is, heavy smokers have a higher chance of havingmore pain sites and greater pain intensity than non-smokers ( 14). However, research on the association between smoking and pain intensity, function, depression and fear in patients with CLBPremains limited, particularly in studies that have conducteddetailed comparisons of disease activity and functional statusin smoking and non-smoking patients with CLBP. This studyaims to investigate the interrelationship between smoking andCLBP from multiple dimensions such as pain intensity,psychology and quality of life. In addition, this study willinvestigate whether the amount of cigarettes smoked dailyaffects the pain intensity, dysfunction, anxiety and depressiondegree of patients with CLBP. </sectionContent>

            <sectionContent>
                 This cross-sectional study assessed pain, dysfunction, anxiety, depression, fear and quality of life in 54 patients with CLBP andcompared the differences between smokers and non-smokers. Wefurther examined the association between the amount ofcigarettes smoked and pain, dysfunction and depression inpatients with CLBP. Baseline data, including sex, age, height, weight, work status, physical activity, location of pain and duration of pain, were recorded. All patient assessmentquestionnaires were completed under the supervision of oneresearcher, and baseline data were recorded by anotherresearcher. </sectionContent>

            <sectionTitle>Participants</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent> GpPower software was used to calculate sample size (one tail; α= 0.05; Power = 0.95; N2/N1 = 1), which is based on a previousstudy of differences in pain intensity measured by VAS betweensmokers and non-smokers ( 17). The results showed that N1 and N2 were 26, and the actual power was 0.950. A total of 54 community residents in the main communities ofQingyuan Street, Yangpu District, Shanghai, were examinedwith an equal number of smokers and non-smokers. The inclusion criteria were: 1) age 18 –65; 2) pain con ﬁned to the waist, buttocks and thighs, with or without leg pain; 3) painintensity at worst 3 or higher on a visual analog scale; 4) CLBP forat least 3 months; 5) patients signed informed consent afterreceiving the purpose and method of this study. The exclusioncriteria were: 1) with mental and cognitive diseases; 2) speci ﬁc lumbago; 3) with neurological disorders, such as stroke andepilepsy. Standardized questionnaires were used to collectdemographic information (e.g., age and gender), education, residential status, marital status, economic income, physical activity level and medical history. The comprehensivedemographic variables are provided in Table 1 . </sectionContent>

            <sectionTitle>Measures</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent> Smoking status was evaluated by self-report by asking “Do you currently smoke every day, occasionally, or never? ”Former smokers were excluded from the study. The rest of the participants were divided into “non-smokers ”and “daily smokers. ”The investigation neither differentiated former smokers from those who never smoked, nor speci ﬁed the minimum quitting time to be considered as a non-smoker. The daily amount of cigarettes smoked by smokers wasrecorded. Health status under CLBP was assessed on a self-reported basis. Pain intensity was measured based on theVisual Analogue Scale (VAS) ( 18). The most severe pain intensity VAS max and the mildest pain intensity VAS min experienced by patients with CLBP were recorded. VAS is acommonly used pain scoring standard, and the pain intensity isdivided into 10 points. 0 points indicate no pain, and 10 pointsindicate severe pain. Anxiety and depression levels were measured based on the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and Zung Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS) ( 19). The higher their scores, the more severe the symptoms. The degree of physical dysfunction was measured by OswestryDisability Index (ODI) and Roland-Morris DisabilityQuestionnaire (RMDQ) ( 20,21). The LBP disability assessment scale is an important tool in the evaluation and rehabilitationtreatment system of LBP. The commonly used LBP dysfunctionassessment scales in the world are ODI and RMDQ. The higher thescores, the more severe the dysfunction. The degree of fear wasmeasured using the Fear-Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire(FABQ), including FABQ-work (FABQ-W) and FABQ-physical activity (FABQ-PA) ( 22). The higher the scores, the higher the degree of fear-avoidance beliefs. The quality of life was measuredusing the 36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-36). The unipedal stancetest with eyes closed was also used to measure balance ability.</sectionContent>

            <sectionTitle>Statistical Analyses </sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>All data were analysed using IBM SPSS Statistics Software(version 26.0). Demographic data from smoking and non-smoking groups were compared using the χ 2test and the Mann –Whitney U-test, expressed as frequencies and medians. Non-parametric tests were used to compare non-normal distributions and experiments with small samples, and p-values less than 0.05 were considered statistically signi ﬁcant. The differences in VAS, ODI, RMDQ, FABQ, SAS, SDS, and SF-36 between the smoking and non-smoking groups were examinedby Mann –Whitney U-test. The correlation between the amount of cigarettes smoked daily and VAS max, VAS min, ODI, RMDQ, the frequency of LBP per month, FABQ total, FABQ-W, FABQ-PA, SF-36, SAS and SDS was explored by linear correlation analysis. Linearly correlated variables, such as the amount of cigarettes smoked daily, were further analysed by multiple linear stepwise regressions. In addition, age, income, education level, history of LBP, frequency of LBP per month, work time, leisure time,duration of ﬁrst pain and duration of LBP per day were included as confounding factors. Multiple linear regressionwas used to control for confounding factors and examine the association between the amount of cigarettes smoked daily andpain intensity, disability, mood and quality of life. Ordinal logisticregression analysis was used to explore the correlation betweenthe amount of cigarettes smoked and the impact of LBP on workand life (none, mild, moderate and severe).</sectionContent>

            <sectionTitle>Smoking vs. Non-Smoking</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent> As shown in Figure 1 , patients in the CLBP smoking group had worse average values on several measures than the non-smokers,which included VAS max, RMDQ, ODI, FABQ-W, FABQ totaland frequency of LBP per month of patients. However, no signi ﬁcant difference in VAS min, SAS and SF-36 was found between the smoking and non-smoking groups. The lack of difference inFABQ-PA between the smoking and non-smoking groups wasconsistent with the ﬁnding that no signi ﬁcant difference in the duration of moderate physical activity was observed between the two groups. The difference in FABQ between the two groups was primarily manifested in the fear-avoidance about work. The twogroups also showed signi ﬁcant differences in the performance of the unipedal stance test with eyes closed, with smokers standingon one leg for less time than the non-smoking group (95% CI,6.00 to 49.00; p= 0.0061; Figure 2 ). The impact of LBP on life ( p= 0.006) and work ( p= 0.032) was mostly moderate and severe in the smoking group, whereas it was mostly no effect or mild in thenon-smoking group ( Table 2 )</sectionContent>

            <sectionTitle>Association Between the Daily Cigarette Smoking Amount and CLBP</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent> A correlation was observed between the daily cigarette smoking amount and VAS max(r = 0.651, p&lt;0.001), FABQtotal ( r= 0.398, p&lt;0.040), SDS ( r= 0.386, p= 0.047) and FABQ-W ( r= 0.45, p= 0.019), but no relationship was observed between the amount of cigarettes smoked daily and ODI, RMDQ, VAS min, SF-36, FABQ-PA, the frequency of LBP per month and SAS ( Figure 3 ). Multiple linear stepwise regression analysis indicated that theamount of cigarettes smoked daily had a statistically signi ﬁcant effect on VAS max(b = 0.18, t = 3.25, p= 0.003), SDS (b = 1.10, t = 2.87, p= 0.008), FABQ-W (b = 0.84, t = 2.25, p= 0.02) and FABQ total(b = 1.10, t = 2.60, p= 0.016). Considering that the partial regression coef ﬁcient values in multiple linear regression for different dependent variables are all positive, the increase inthe amount of cigarettes smoked daily will lead to differentdegrees of increase in VAS max, FABQ-W, FABQ totaland SDS scores. The results of multivariate regression analysis indicatedthat after excluding the effect of other confounding factors, theamount of cigarettes smoked daily could independently beassociated with pain, depressive symptoms and fear-avoidance belief in patients with CLBP. This result indicated that the increase in the daily cigarette smoking amount was positivelycorrelated with the aggravation of pain intensity, depression andfear-avoidance belief in patients with CLBP. The impact of LBP on work is an unavoidable status quo for patients with CLBP. Thus, the degree of work affected by CLBP isan important indicator of concern in this study. The effects of theamount of cigarettes smoked daily, moderate-intensity physicalactivity per week, age, leisure time, work time and economicincome on this indicator were analysed using ordinal logistic regression with proportional odds assumption. Logisticregression analysis proved that the daily cigarette smoking amount was a signi ﬁcant predictor of the increasing impact of LBP on work ( p= 0.019), which indicates its signi ﬁcant positive relationship with the impact level of LBP on work, that is, thehigher the amount of cigarettes smoked daily, the greater theimpact of LBP on the daily work. The OR value is 1.35 (95% CI,1.05 –1.73), which indicates that the amount of cigarettes smoked daily is an important factor leading to the aggravation of theimpact of LBP on work. Amongst the factors related to the impactof LBP on life, the daily cigarette smoking amount did not showsigniﬁcance. </sectionContent>

            <sectionTitle>DISCUSSION</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent> This study examined the association between smoking and pain, dysfunction, depression, anxiety and quality of life in patientswith CLBP. We found signi ﬁcant differences in VAS, ODI, RMDQ and FABQ between smokers and non-smokers, whichindicated that the smoking group had higher pain intensity,degree of dysfunction and fear-avoidance caused by CLBP than the non-smoking group. In addition, a correlation was observed between the daily cigarette smoking amount andpain, depression and fear belief in patients with CLBP. The differences in pain and functional impairment between the smoking and non-smoking groups were statistically and clinically signi ﬁcant. VAS max of the smoking group was concentrated at 5 –7, whereas the non-smoking group was concentrated at 4 –6. Therefore, patients with CLBP in the smoking group had severe pain, whereas the other group hadmostly moderate pain ( 23). The clinical signi ﬁcance of the difference in ODI and RMDQ is signi ﬁcant. Patients in the smoking group likely have moderate disabilities, and theyexperienced more pain and dif ﬁculty sitting, lifting and standing ( 24). Patients in the non-smoking group had a mostly minimal disability, and they can cope with most living activities. However, no correlation was found between the daily cigarette smoking amount and ODI and RMDQ, indicating thatthe impact of smoking on the function of patients with CLBP canoccur under slight smoking intensity and cannot necessarilyaggravate with the increase of the amount of cigarettessmoked. The extent of the damage may be associated with theinitiation and duration of smoking or the daily cigarette smokingamount at a particular stage in the evolution of the disease. Regarding the association between smoking and pain, the results are consistent with previous studies ( 25). Smoking has been con ﬁrmed as a potential cause of musculoskeletal pain, and it is closely related to back pain ( 16). However, the mechanisms of LBP are only partly known. Smoking can increase the frequencyof coughing, and coughing increases abdominal pressure, whichintensi ﬁes the compression and stretch of the intervertebral disc on the nerve root, thereby blocking the venous return of theinﬂamed nerve root and increasing edema and sensitivity of the nerve to pain ( 26). Smoking is also associated with osteoporosis, which may alter the microscopic structure of the spine byreducing bone mineral content ( 27). It can impair ﬁbrinolysis and increase ﬁbrous deposition and scarring, leading to chronic infection and LBP ( 28). Moreover, smoking can reduce vertebral blood ﬂow and affect intervertebral metabolic balance, thereby accelerating the degenerative process and making the spine morevulnerable to mechanical deformation and trauma ( 29–31). And it also reduces arterial blood ﬂow, leading to ischemia of compressed nerve roots and pain. Furthermore, smoking altersdisc gene expression, reduces collagen genes and increasesproteoglycan and metalloproteinase 1 tissue inhibitoryactivity ( 32). The amount of cigarettes smoked daily was correlated with VAS maxbut not with VAS min. This result may indicate that the extent to which smoking affects chronic pain is related to its basic pain intensity. For slight pain conditions, the role of smoking as an in ﬂuencing factor was not prominent. However, as the pain got worse, the association between smoking and pain alsoincreased. Thus, this study may provide new insights into themechanism of the association between smoking and pain. Laterstudies investigating the relationship and mechanism of smokingand pain can focus on further quantifying pain intensity anddetermining whether a non-linear correlation exists betweensmoking and pain intensity, that is, the greater the intensity ofpain, the greater the association between cigarette smoking and pain intensity. The performance of the two groups on the one-leg standing test was consistent with their pain intensity differences. CLBP reduces the stability of the spinal area and increases the activation time of the gluteus medius muscle, which leads to differences inthe ability to control lower limb balance ( 33). Smoking may affect the ability of patients with CLBP to stand on a single leg byaffecting their pain intensity. However, at present, no relevantresearch has been conducted to determine whether or notsmoking directly affects the neural mechanism controllingmuscle coordination, which may be the direction of futureresearch. This study also found that after adjusting for age, income, education level, history of LBP, frequency of LBP last month and other confounders, the daily cigarette smoking amount remained positively correlated with the SDS, which indicated therelationship between the amount of cigarettes smoked dailyand the aggravation of depressive symptoms in patients withCLBP. The current study found that depression was correlatedwith smoking ( 34). Chronic pain reduces social connection, and smokers are less socially active and lonelier than non-smokers(35). Vogt et al. ( 36) adjusted for income, education level, occupation, employment, life stress, childhood adversity,divorce and neurosis and found that smoking remainedassociated with depression. Research suggests that the smoking –depression association is bipolar. The presence of depressive symptoms increases the risk of developing nicotinedependence in smokers, thereby increasing the risk of depression(37). The occurrence of smoking addiction and depressive symptoms has a common neurotransmitter pathway, and theymay have a common genetic material basis ( 38). Anxiety and depression have been associated with a bidirectional effect of promoting smoking ( 39), and negative emotions have been con ﬁrmed as a central mechanism for the correlation of pain with smoking ( 40,41). Pain-related anxiety was relevant to increasing pain intensity and positively related to heavy smoking and nicotine use to cope with aversive states ( 42). Increasing pain-related anxiety and pain sensitivity were relatedto early initiation of smoking ( 43). Whether or not smoking had a signiﬁcant effect on the anxiety of patients with CLBP was not shown in this study probably because anxiety caused by the painintensity of CLBP was not enough to cause the related effect ofsmoking, or the negative emotions caused by CLBP were moreprone to depression. Future treatments should target whetherCLBP-related anxiety may contribute to behavioural tendenciesto relieve pain and negative effects through cigarette smoking. CLBP can be attributed to a biological –psychological –social phenomenon. Patient ’s anatomical injury factors interact with psychosocial factors ( 44), such as fear-avoidance belief, which indicates that some patients with LBP have negative beliefs aboutpain that can lead to a catastrophic psychological reaction,causing the patient to fear activities that may aggravate painor injury. Avoidance of such activities can reduce the likelihood ofrepeat pain or injury ( 45). Fear-avoidance beliefs can be a predictor of outcome in patients with subacute LBP ( 46). In this study, the daily cigarette smoking amount was found to be positively correlated with FABQ totaland FABQ-W, particularly to work, which in turn led to excessive fear of pain or injury andgradually extended to fear of physical movement. This ﬁnding is also consistent with the association between smoking and pain intensity and depression in this study. Depression is an important inﬂuencing factor of fear-avoidance beliefs ( 47). Considering that depressed patients are often in a state of low emotionalresponsiveness and lack of enthusiasm and motivation toactively respond to symptoms, they tend to develop fear-avoidance beliefs about pain. Depression, including clinicallydiagnosed depression and patient-reported depressivesymptoms, is common in patients with CLBP ( 48). Pain patients with depressive symptoms tend to have more intensepain experiences and more severe physical damage. Smoking isclosely related to depression ( 37), indicating that smoking may be related to fear beliefs by affecting depressive symptoms in patients with CLBP. Future research can focus on the interaction ofsmoking, depression and fear-avoidance beliefs in patients with CLBP. The daily cigarette smoking amount is related to the impact of LBP on work but not related to the impact of LBP on life probablybecause the working conditions of most people are relativelymonotonous, which reduces the impact of other factors to ahigher degree, thereby making the impact of smoking fullyexposed. In daily life, individuals have more options tomaintain low-intensity LBP for themselves, which highlight the weight of factors such as income, leisure time and daily activity in the impact of LBP on life and indirectly offset the effectof the amount of cigarettes smoked daily. This result indicatesthat future research should include more population in the studyto explore the correlation between smoking and the impact ofLBP on life under more undisturbed conditions. </sectionContent>

            <sectionTitle>Conclusion</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent> This cross-sectional study investigated the association betweensmoking and pain, dysfunction and psychological status inpatients with CLBP and analysed the relationship between the amount of cigarettes smoked daily and CLBP. The results of the study indicated that smoking was related to the aggravation ofsymptoms in patients with CLBP, which suggested that patientswith CLBP and people at risk of LBP should be aware of the harmcaused by smoking. Given the limitation of the sample size andcross-sectional study, this study cannot explain thecorresponding causation between the amount of cigarettessmoked daily and the aggravation of CLBP. Future researchshould further expand the sample size and control economic conditions, medical level, occupation and other confoundingfactors. </sectionContent>
