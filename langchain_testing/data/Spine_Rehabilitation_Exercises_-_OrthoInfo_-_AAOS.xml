            <sectionTitle>Purpose of Program</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>After an injury or surgery, an exercise conditioning program can help you return to daily activities and enjoy a more 
                active, healthy lifestyle. Following a well-structured conditioning program can also help you return to sports and other 
                recreational activities. 
                This is a general conditioning program that provides a wide range of exercises. To ensure that the program is safe 
                and effective for you, it should be performed under your doctor’s supervision. Talk to your doctor or physical therapist 
                about which exercises will best help you meet your rehabilitation goals.
                Strength: Strengthening the muscles that support your spine will help keep your back and upper body stable. Keeping 
                these muscles strong can relieve back pain and prevent further injury.
                Flexibility: Stretching the muscles that you strengthen is important for restoring range of motion and preventing injury. 
                Gently stretching after strengthening exercises can help reduce muscle soreness and keep your muscles long and flexible.
                Target Muscles: The muscle groups targeted in this conditioning program include: 
                • Cervical spine (neck)
                • Trapezius (neck and upper back)
                • Latissimus dorsi (side and middle back)
                • Back extensors and erector spinae 
                (middle and lower back)
                • Quadratus lumborum (lower back)
                • Abdominals
                • External oblique rotators (side and lower back)
                • Internal oblique rotators (side and lower back)
                • Piriformis (buttocks)
                • Gluteus maximus (buttocks)
                • Gluteus medias (buttocks)
                • Hamstrings (back of thigh)
                Length of program: This spine conditioning program should be continued for 4 to 6 weeks, unless otherwise specified 
                by your doctor or physical therapist. After your recovery, these exercises can be continued as a maintenance program 
                for lifelong protection and health of your spine. Performing the exercises 2 to 3 days a week will maintain strength and 
                range of motion in your back.</sectionContent>

            <sectionTitle>Getting Started</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>Warm up: Before doing the following exercises, warm up with 5 to 10 minutes of low impact activity, like walking or 
                riding a stationary bicycle.
                Stretch: After the warm-up, do the stretching exercises shown on Page 1 before moving on to the strengthening 
                exercises. When you have completed the strengthening exercises, repeat the stretching exercises to end the program.
                Do not ignore pain: You should not feel pain during an exercise. Talk to your doctor or physical therapist if you have 
                any pain while exercising.
                Ask questions: If you are not sure how to do an exercise, or how often to do it, contact your doctor or physical therapist.</sectionContent>
