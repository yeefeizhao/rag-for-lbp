            <sectionContent>Pain is an unpleasant sensation and emotional experience that is or feels like it is related to damage to the body.

                People feel pain through their senses, such as touch. Pain travels through nerves leading to your brain. The brain determines the pain’s severity, pattern, and location. Not all pain feels the same and it is affected by people’s memories, beliefs, and emotions.</sectionContent>
