            <sectionContent>Most people have at least one backache in their life. Although this pain or discomfort can happen anywhere in your back, the most common area affected is your lower back. This is because the lower back supports most of your body's weight.
Low back pain is the number two reason that Americans see their health care provider. It is second only to colds and flu. 
You will usually first feel back pain just after you lift a heavy object, move suddenly, sit in one position for a long time, or have an injury or accident. 
Acute low back pain is most often caused by a sudden injury to the muscles and ligaments supporting the back. The pain may be caused by muscle spasms or a strain or tear in the muscles and ligaments.
Causes of sudden low back pain include:
Compression fractures to the spine from osteoporosisCancer involving the spineFracture of a spine boneMuscle spasm (very tense muscles)Ruptured or herniated diskSciaticaSpinal stenosis (narrowing of the spinal canal)Spine curvatures (like scoliosis or kyphosis), which may be inherited and seen in children or teensStrain or tears to the muscles or ligaments supporting the back 
Low back pain may also be due to:
An abdominal aortic aneurysm that is leaking.Arthritis conditions, such as osteoarthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and rheumatoid arthritis.Infection of the spine (osteomyelitis, diskitis, abscess).Kidney infection or kidney stones.Problems related to pregnancy.Problems with your gall bladder or pancreas may cause back pain.Medical conditions that affect the female reproductive organs, including endometriosis, ovarian cysts, ovarian cancer, or uterine fibroids.Pain around the back of your pelvis, or sacroiliac (SI) joint. </sectionContent>

            <sectionTitle>Exams and Tests</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>When you first see your provider, you will be asked about your back pain, including how often it happens and how severe it is. 
Your provider will try to determine the cause of your back pain and whether it is likely to quickly get better with simple measures such as ice, mild painkillers, physical therapy, and proper exercises. Most of the time, back pain will get better using these methods.
During the physical exam, your provider will try to pinpoint the location of the pain and figure out how it affects your movement. 
Most people with back pain improve or recover within 4 to 6 weeks and often much sooner than that. Your provider may not order any tests of your spine during the first visit or for 4 to 6 weeks unless you have certain symptoms.
Tests that might be ordered include: 
Blood tests such as a complete blood count (CBC) or erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)X-rayCT scan of the lower spineMRI of the lower spine</sectionContent>

            <sectionContent>To get better quickly, take the right measures when you first feel pain.
Here are some tips for how to handle pain:
Stop normal physical activity for the first few days. This will help relieve your symptoms and reduce any swelling in the area of the pain.Apply heat or ice to the painful area. One good method is to use ice for the first 48 to 72 hours and then use heat.Take over-the-counter pain relievers such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) or acetaminophen (Tylenol). Follow package instructions on how much to take. Do not take more than the recommended amount. 
While sleeping, try lying in a curled-up, fetal position with a pillow between your legs. If you usually sleep on your back, place a pillow or rolled towel under your knees to relieve pressure.
A common misbelief about back pain is that you need to rest and avoid activity for a long time. In fact, bed rest is not recommended. If you have no sign of a serious cause for your back pain (such as loss of bowel or bladder control, weakness, weight loss, or fever), then you should stay as active as possible. It is important to prevent your back and abdominal muscles from becoming too weak.
You should reduce your activity only for the first couple of days. Then, slowly start your usual activities after that. Do not perform activities that involve heavy lifting or twisting of your back for the first 6 weeks after the pain begins. After 2 to 3 weeks, you should gradually start exercising again.
Begin with light aerobic activity. Walking, riding a stationary bicycle, and swimming are great examples. These activities can improve blood flow to your back and promote healing. They also strengthen muscles in your stomach and back.You may benefit from physical therapy. Your provider will determine whether you need to see a physical therapist and can refer you to one. The physical therapist will first use methods to reduce your pain. Then, the therapist will teach you ways to prevent getting back pain again.Stretching and strengthening exercises are important. But, starting these exercises too soon after an injury can make your pain worse. A physical therapist can tell you when to begin stretching and strengthening exercises and how to do them. 
If your pain lasts longer than 1 month, your primary provider may send you to see a physiatrist (specialist in rehabilitation), or an orthopedist (bone specialist).
If your pain has not improved after use of medicines, physical therapy, and other treatments, your provider may recommend an epidural injection.
