Back pain is a common problem that many people experience. It can happen for many reasons, like lifting heavy objects, sitting too long, or not using the right posture. Understanding your back pain can help you manage it better.

## Your Work and Daily Life

You work full-time, which means you spend a lot of time sitting. Sitting for long periods can sometimes make back pain worse. It's important to take breaks and move around when you can. 

### Tips for Your Work Environment:
- **Take Breaks:** Stand up and stretch every hour.
- **Adjust Your Chair:** Make sure your chair supports your lower back.
- **Keep Your Feet Flat:** Your feet should be flat on the floor when sitting.

## Exercise and Back Pain

You exercise regularly, which is great! You do aerobic activities 4 days a week and resistance training 3 days a week. However, you mentioned that exercise sometimes makes your back pain worse. Here are some tips:

### Safe Exercise Tips:
- **Listen to Your Body:** If something hurts, stop doing it.
- **Choose Gentle Activities:** Try walking, swimming, or yoga, which can be easier on your back.
- **Talk to a Professional:** A physical therapist can help you find exercises that are safe for your back.

## Lifting Objects

You feel confident about your lifting technique, which is good! Using the right technique can help prevent back injuries. Here's how to lift safely:

### Safe Lifting Steps:
1. **Stand Close to the Object:** Keep it near your body.
2. **Bend Your Knees:** Squat down instead of bending at your waist.
3. **Lift with Your Legs:** Use your leg muscles to lift, not your back.
4. **Keep Your Back Straight:** Avoid twisting your body while lifting.

- If you have numbness or tingling in your legs.
- If you have trouble moving or doing daily activities.

## Rest and Pain Management
