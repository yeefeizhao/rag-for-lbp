What is Angelman syndrome?
Angelman syndrome is a genetic disorder that primarily affects the nervous system. The disorder is named after
Dr. Harry Angelman who first reported the syndrome in 1965.
Features that help define the disorder include:
Developmental delay
Intellectual disability
Severe speech impairment
Problems with movement and balance (ataxia)
Recurrent seizures (epilepsy)
Very happy demeanor with frequent laughter
A small head size (microcephaly)
Often, there are also gastrointestinal, orthopedic, and eye problems.
Hyperactivity and a short attention span are common.
Infants with AS appear normal at birth but often have feeding problems in the first months of life. They also show developmental delays between the ages of 6 and 12 months. Seizures often begin between ages 2 and 3.
The disorder results from the loss of function of a gene called UBE3A, which
provides instructions for making a protein (
ubiquitin protein ligase E3A) that
plays an important role in the development and function of the nervous system.
There is no specific therapy for
AS
. The focus of treatment is to reduce seizures, anxiety, and gastrointestinal issues and improve sleep. Seizures may be treated with medications and dietary therapies. Sleep issues may be treated with medications and sleep training. Physical, occupational, and speech therapies should begin early and continue as long as they are needed. Many people also may benefit from applied behavior analysis and/or behavior therapy.
Most people with AS will have significant developmental delays, speech limitations, and motor problems. They still will understand much of what is said. They also often learn to communicate non-verbally and with communication devices. People with AS appear to have normal life spans.

Learn About Clinical Trials
Clinical trials are studies that allow us to learn more about disorders and improve care. They can help connect patients with new and upcoming treatment options.
How can I or my loved one help improve care for people with Angelman syndrome?
Consider participating in a clinical trial so clinicians and scientists can learn more about AS and related disorders. Clinical research uses human volunteers to help researchers learn more about a disorder and perhaps find better ways to safely detect, treat, or prevent disease.
All types of volunteers are needed—
those who are healthy or may have an illness or disease—
of all different ages, sexes, races, and ethnicities to ensure that study results apply to as many people as possible, and that treatments will be safe and effective for everyone who will use them.
