Data Summary: Muscular Dystrophy
Key points
The data and statistics on this page come from MD STAR
net
.  Findings from the MD STAR
net
sites cannot be generalized to the entire United States.
MD STAR
net
:  How we got these numbers
The tables below show data on males with Duchenne or Becker muscular dystrophy (DBMD) in 10 MD STAR
net
states or regions.  The information was collected during the years 1982-2015.  Incomplete records may cause the totals in each table to differ.
These numbers represent males identified with asymptomatic, definite, or probable DBMD.  These criteria are described in detail in Table 1 within the
MD STAR
net
case definitions
.
Classifying someone as having DBMD is based on:
When symptoms first appear
Genetic testing results
Muscle biopsy results
When an individual stopped walking
Steroid use
Those who could not be classified as having definite or probable DBMD were excluded.

Key findings
Prevalence of DBMD
About 1 in every 5,000 males aged 5-9 years
1
Lower among non-Hispanic blacks than non-Hispanic whites
1
2
Higher among Hispanics than non-Hispanic whites
1
2
DMD was three times more prevalent than Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD).
2
Survival of males with DMD
The median age of survival in males with DMD was 23.7 years.
3
Treatments linked to increased survival in males with DMD were:
Steroids
Cough assist, and
Scoliosis surgery.
Diagnosis
Total time from first signs to diagnosis was 2.5 years
Among males with DMD who did not have a family history of muscular dystrophy the:
Time between noticing signs and diagnosis was about 2.5 years
4
5
Average age at diagnosis was 5 years
4
5
When compared to non-Hispanic white children, non-Hispanic black or Hispanic children on average:
Were tested for DBMD at later ages
6
Had creatine kinase (CK) testing about 1 year later
6
Had DNA testing about 2 years later
6
Steroid use
The average age when boys began taking steroids was 7 years old.
7
Between about 1/2 and 2/3 of males with DBMD had taken steroids.
7
Black males with DMD began steroid treatment less often.
8
Steroid use and walking
On average, males with DMD who:
Had not taken steroids stopped walking at about age 10
9
Took steroids for less than 3 years stopped walking at about age 9½
9
Took steroids more than 5 years stopped walking about age 12
9
Steroid use and heart and lung problems
Each year of steroid use lowered the chance of heart problems by 4%.
7
Males with DMD who continued to use steroids after they stopped walking:
Developed lung problems later than males who never used steroids
10
Developed lung problems later than males who stopped steroids
10
Wheelchair use
The proportion of males with DBMD who used a wheelchair varied by age:
About 3 in 10 males with DBMD ages 5 to 9 years used a wheelchair.
11
About 8 in 10 males with DBMD ages 10 to 14 years used a wheelchair.
11
9 in 10 males with DBMD ages 15 to 24 years used a wheelchair.
11
Wheelchair use varies by age
Mental health
For males with DBMD:
More than 4 in 10 had a mental health concern.*
12
Behavioral concerns were twice as common in those who took steroids.
12
Depression affected those not walking 3 times more than those walking.
12
*
behavioral concerns
,
depressed mood
, or
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)
