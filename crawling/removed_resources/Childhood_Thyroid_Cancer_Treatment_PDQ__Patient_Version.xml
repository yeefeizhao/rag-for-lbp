Key Points
Thyroid cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the thyroid gland.
Thyroid nodules may be adenomas or carcinomas.
Thyroid nodules may be found during a routine medical exam and are usually not cancer.
Being exposed to radiation or having certain genetic syndromes can affect the risk of thyroid cancer.
Medullary thyroid cancer is sometimes caused by a change in a gene that is passed from parent to child.
Signs of thyroid cancer include a swelling or lump in the neck.
Tests that examine the thyroid, neck, and blood are used to diagnose and stage thyroid cancer.
Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery).
Thyroid cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the thyroid gland.
The
thyroid
is a
gland
at the base of the
throat
near the
trachea
(windpipe). It is shaped like a butterfly, with a right
lobe
and a left lobe. The
isthmus
is a thin piece of
tissue
that connects the two lobes. It usually cannot be felt through the skin.

Anatomy of the thyroid and parathyroid glands. The thyroid gland lies at the base of the throat near the trachea. It is shaped like a butterfly, with the right lobe and left lobe connected by a thin piece of tissue called the isthmus. The parathyroid glands are four pea-sized organs found in the neck near the thyroid. The thyroid and parathyroid glands make hormones.
The thyroid uses
iodine
, a
mineral
found in some foods and in iodized salt, to help make several
hormones
.
Thyroid hormones
do the following:
Control
heart rate
, body temperature, and how quickly food is changed into energy (
metabolism
).
Control the amount of
calcium
in the
blood
.
Thyroid nodules may be adenomas or carcinomas.
There are two types of thyroid
nodules
:
Adenomas
:
Adenomas can grow very large and sometimes make hormones. Adenomas are not
cancer
but may rarely become
malignant
(cancer) and spread to the
lungs
or
lymph nodes
in the neck.
Carcinomas
:
There are three main types of thyroid carcinoma in children:
Papillary
.
Papillary thyroid carcinoma is the most common type of
thyroid cancer
in children. It occurs most often in teens. Papillary thyroid carcinoma is often made up of more than one nodule on both sides of the thyroid. It often spreads to the lymph nodes in the neck and may also spread to the lung. The
prognosis
(chance of
recovery
) for most patients is very good.
Follicular
.
Follicular thyroid carcinoma is usually made up of one nodule. It often spreads to the bone and lung, but  rarely spreads to the lymph nodes in the neck. The prognosis for most patients is very good.
Medullary
.
Medullary thyroid carcinoma forms from parafollicular
C cells
in the thyroid. It is usually linked to a certain
inherited
change in the
RET
gene
and
multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN 2) syndrome
. It occurs most often in children aged 4 years and younger and may have spread to other parts of the body at the time of
diagnosis
. Children who have MEN2 syndrome may also be at risk of developing
pheochromocytoma
or
hyperparathyroidism
.
Papillary and follicular thyroid cancer are sometimes called
differentiated
thyroid cancer. Medullary and
anaplastic thyroid cancer
are sometimes called poorly differentiated or
undifferentiated
thyroid cancer. Anaplastic thyroid cancer is very rare in children and is not discussed in this summary.
Thyroid nodules may be found during a routine medical exam and are usually not cancer.
Your child’s doctor may find a lump (nodule) in the thyroid during a routine medical exam, or a nodule may be seen on an
imaging test
or during
surgery
for another
condition
. A thyroid nodule is an
abnormal
growth of thyroid
cells
in the thyroid. Nodules may be solid or
fluid
-filled.
When a thyroid nodule is found, an
ultrasound
of the thyroid and lymph nodes in the neck is done. A
fine-needle aspiration biopsy
may be done to check for
signs
of cancer.
Blood tests
to check thyroid hormone levels and for anti-thyroid
antibodies
in the blood may also be done. This is to check for other types of thyroid disease.
Thyroid nodules usually don't cause
symptoms
or need treatment. Sometimes the thyroid nodules become large enough that it is hard to swallow or breathe and more tests and treatment are needed. Only one in five thyroid nodules become cancer.
Being exposed to radiation or having certain genetic syndromes can affect the risk of thyroid cancer.
Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a
risk factor
. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesn’t mean that you will not get cancer. Talk with your doctor if you think your child may be at risk.
Risk factors for childhood thyroid cancer include the following:
Being exposed to
radiation
, such as from
diagnostic tests
,
radiation treatment
, or radiation in the environment.
Having certain
genetic
syndromes, such as the following:
Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A (MEN2A) syndrome
.
Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2B (MEN2B) syndrome
.
Having a
family history
of thyroid cancer, including the following:
APC
-associated
polyposis
.
DICER1 syndrome
.
Carney complex
.
PTEN
hamartoma
tumor
syndrome
.
Werner syndrome
.
Medullary thyroid cancer is sometimes caused by a change in a gene that is passed from parent to child.
The genes in cells carry
hereditary
information from parent to child. A certain change in the
RET
gene that is passed from parent to child (inherited) may cause medullary thyroid cancer.
There is a
genetic test
that is used to check for the changed gene. The patient is tested first to see if he or she has the changed gene. If the patient has it, other family members may also be tested to find out if they have an increased risk of medullary thyroid cancer. Family members, including young children, who have the changed gene may have a
thyroidectomy
(surgery to remove the thyroid). This can decrease the chance of developing medullary thyroid cancer.
Signs of thyroid cancer include a swelling or lump in the neck.
Sometimes thyroid tumors do not cause any signs or symptoms. These and other signs and symptoms may be caused by papillary or follicular thyroid cancer or by other conditions.
Check with your child's doctor if your child has any of the following:
A lump in the neck.
Trouble breathing.
Trouble swallowing.
Hoarseness or a change in the voice.
These and other signs and symptoms may be caused by medullary thyroid cancer or by other conditions.
Check with your child's doctor if your child has any of the following:
Bumps on the lips, tongue, or eyelids that do not hurt.
Trouble making tears.
Constipation
.
Marfan syndrome
(being tall and thin, with long arms, legs, fingers, and toes).
Tests that examine the thyroid, neck, and blood are used to diagnose and stage thyroid cancer.
Tests are done to diagnose and
stage
cancer. After cancer is diagnosed, more tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread to nearby areas or to other parts of the body. This process is called
staging
. Tests done to find out if cancer cells have spread before the tumor is removed by surgery is called preoperative staging. It is important to know whether cancer has spread in order to plan the best treatment.
The following tests and procedures may be used:
Physical exam
and
health history
:
An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps (nodules) or swelling in the neck,
voice box
, and lymph nodes, and anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patient’s health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.
Thyroid function test:
The blood is checked for abnormal levels of
thyroid-stimulating hormone
(TSH). TSH is made by the
pituitary gland
in the
brain
. It stimulates the release of thyroid hormone and controls how fast follicular thyroid cells grow. The blood may also be checked for high levels of
calcitonin
(a hormone made by the thyroid that decreases the amount of
calcium
in the blood).
Thyroglobulin
test:
The blood is checked for the amount of thyroglobulin, a
protein
made by the
thyroid gland
. Thyroglobulin levels are low or absent with normal thyroid function but may be higher with thyroid cancer or other conditions.
RET
gene test:
A
laboratory test
in which a sample of blood or
tissue
is tested for certain changes in the
RET
gene. This test is done for children who may have medullary thyroid cancer.
Ultrasound
exam:
A procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal tissues or
organs
in the neck and make echoes. The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a
sonogram
. The picture can be printed to be looked at later. This procedure can show the size of a thyroid nodule and whether it is solid or a fluid-filled
cyst
. Ultrasound may be used to guide a fine-needle aspiration biopsy. A complete ultrasound exam of the neck is done before surgery.
Thyroid
scan
: A small amount of a
radioactive
substance is swallowed or
injected
. The radioactive material collects in thyroid gland cells. A special camera linked to a computer detects the radiation given off and makes pictures that show how the thyroid looks and functions and whether the cancer has spread beyond the thyroid gland. If the amount of TSH in the child's blood is low, a scan to make images of the thyroid may be done before surgery.
CT scan
(CAT scan):
A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the neck, chest,
abdomen
, and brain, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an
x-ray
machine. A
dye
may be injected into a
vein
or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.
Enlarge
Computed tomography (CT) scan of the head and neck. The child lies on a table that slides through the CT scanner, which takes a series of detailed x-ray pictures of the inside of the head and neck.
MRI
(magnetic resonance imaging) with
gadolinium
: A procedure that uses a magnet,
radio waves
, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the neck and chest. A substance called gadolinium is injected into a vein. The gadolinium collects around the cancer cells so they show up brighter in the picture. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).
Chest x-ray
: An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest. An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.
Fine-needle aspiration biopsy:
The removal of thyroid tissue using a thin needle. The needle is inserted through the skin into the thyroid. Several tissue samples are removed from different parts of the thyroid. A
pathologist
views the tissue samples under a
microscope
to look for cancer cells. Because the type of thyroid cancer can be hard to diagnose, patients should ask to have
biopsy samples
checked by a pathologist who has experience diagnosing thyroid cancer. If it is not clear whether cancer is present, a
surgical biopsy
may be done.
Surgical biopsy:
The removal of the thyroid nodule or one lobe of the thyroid during surgery so the cells and tissues can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer. Because the type of thyroid cancer can be hard to diagnose, patients should ask to have biopsy samples checked by a pathologist who has experience diagnosing thyroid cancer.
Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery).
The prognosis depends on the following:
The age of the child at the time of diagnosis.
The type of thyroid cancer.
The size of the cancer.
Whether the tumor has spread to lymph nodes or other parts of the body at the time of diagnosis.
Whether the cancer was completely removed by surgery.
The child's general health.
Stages of Childhood Thyroid Cancer
Key Points
After the cancer has been removed by surgery, tests are done to find out if cancer cells remain in the body.
There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.
Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.
Sometimes childhood thyroid cancer  continues to grow or comes back after treatment.
After the cancer has been removed by surgery, tests are done to find out if cancer cells remain in the body.
Tests are done after
surgery
to find out if
cancer
cells
remain and to determine if more treatment is needed. This is called
postoperative
staging
.
The following tests and procedures may be done about 12 weeks after surgery:
Ultrasound
exam
: A procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal
tissues
or
organs
in the neck and make echoes. The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a
sonogram
. The picture can be printed to be looked at later. This procedure can show the size of a
thyroid
nodule
and whether it is solid or a
fluid
-filled
cyst
. Ultrasound may be used to guide a
fine-needle aspiration biopsy
. A complete ultrasound exam of the neck is done before surgery.
Thyroglobulin
test
: A test that measures the amount of thyroglobulin in the
blood
. Thyroglobulin is a
protein
made by the
thyroid gland
. Thyroglobulin levels are low or absent with normal thyroid function but may be higher with
thyroid cancer
or other
conditions
.
Whole-body thyroid
scan
: A small amount of
radioactive
substance is swallowed or
injected
. The radioactive material collects in any thyroid tissue or cancer cells remaining after surgery.
Radioactive iodine
is used because only thyroid cells take up
iodine
. A special camera detects the
radiation
given off by the thyroid tissue or cancer cells, also called radioactive iodine scan or RAI scan.
There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.
Cancer can spread through
tissue
, the
lymph system
, and the
blood
:
Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.
Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the
lymph vessels
to other parts of the body.
Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the
blood vessels
to other parts of the body.
Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.
When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called
metastasis
. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the
primary tumor
) and travel through the lymph system or blood.
Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a
tumor
(
metastatic
tumor) in another part of the body.
Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.
The
metastatic
tumor is the same type of cancer as the
primary tumor
. For example, if thyroid cancer spreads to the
lung
, the cancer cells in the lung are actually thyroid cancer cells. The disease is metastatic thyroid cancer, not
lung cancer
.
Many cancer deaths are caused when cancer moves from the original tumor and spreads to other tissues and organs. This is called metastatic cancer. This animation shows how cancer cells travel from the place in the body where they first formed to other parts of the body.
Sometimes childhood thyroid cancer  continues to grow or comes back after treatment.
Progressive
thyroid cancer is cancer that continues to grow, spread, or get worse.  Progressive disease may be a
sign
that the cancer has become
refractory
to treatment.
Recurrent
thyroid cancer is cancer that has
recurred
(come back) after treatment. The cancer may come back in the thyroid or in other parts of the body.
Treatment Option Overview
Key Points
There are different types of treatment for patients with thyroid cancer.
Children with thyroid cancer should have their treatment planned by a team of doctors who are experts in treating childhood cancer.
Four types of standard treatment are used:
Surgery
Radioactive iodine therapy
Targeted therapy
Hormone replacement therapy
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
Treatment for childhood thyroid cancer may cause side effects.
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
Follow-up tests may be needed.
There are different types of treatment for patients with thyroid cancer.
Some treatments are
standard
(the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in
clinical trials
.  A treatment clinical trial is a
research study
meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the  standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment.
Because cancer in children is rare, taking part in a clinical trial should be considered.  Some clinical trials are open only to patients  who have not started treatment.
Children with thyroid cancer should have their treatment planned by a team of doctors who are experts in treating childhood cancer.
A pediatric oncologist, a doctor who specializes in treating children with cancer, oversees treatment for cancer. The pediatric oncologist works with other health care providers who are experts in treating children with cancer and also specialize in other areas of medicine. Other specialists may include:
pediatrician
pediatric surgeon
radiation oncologist
pathologist
pediatric nurse specialist
social worker
rehabilitation specialist
psychologist
child-life specialist
Four types of standard treatment are used:
Surgery
Surgery
is the most common treatment for
thyroid cancer
. One of the following procedures may be used:
Total
thyroidectomy
: Removal of the whole
thyroid
.
Lymph nodes
near the
cancer
may also be removed and checked under a
microscope
for
signs
of cancer.
Near-total thyroidectomy: Removal of all but a very small part of the thyroid. Lymph nodes near the cancer may also be removed and checked under a microscope for signs of cancer.
In children, a total thyroidectomy is usually done.
Radioactive iodine therapy
Follicular
and
papillary thyroid cancers
are sometimes treated with
radioactive iodine
(RAI) therapy. RAI therapy may be given to children after surgery to kill any thyroid cancer
cells
that were not removed or to children whose
tumor
cannot be removed by surgery. RAI is taken by mouth and collects in any remaining thyroid
tissue
, including thyroid cancer cells that have spread to other places in the body. Because only thyroid tissue takes up
iodine
, the RAI destroys thyroid tissue and thyroid cancer cells without harming other tissue. Before a full treatment
dose
of RAI is given, a small test dose is given to see if the tumor takes up the iodine.
Targeted therapy
Targeted therapy
is a type of treatment that uses
drugs
or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells. Targeted therapies usually cause less harm to normal cells than
chemotherapy
or
radiation therapy
do.
Tyrosine kinase inhibitor
therapy (TKI) is a type of targeted therapy that blocks signals needed for tumors to grow.
Larotrectinib
and
entrectinib
are TKIs used to treat children with progressive or recurrent papillary and follicular thyroid cancer.
Vandetanib
is a TKI used to treat children with
advanced
medullary thyroid cancer
.
Selpercatinib
is a TKI used to treat children with advanced or metastatic thyroid cancer.
Targeted therapy is being studied for the treatment of childhood thyroid cancer that has
recurred
(come back).
Hormone replacement therapy
Hormones
are substances made by
glands
in the body and circulated in the bloodstream. After treatment for thyroid cancer, the thyroid is not able to make enough
thyroid hormone
. Patients are given thyroid
hormone replacement
pills for the rest of their lives.
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
Information about
clinical trials
is available from the
NCI website
.
Treatment for childhood thyroid cancer may cause side effects.
To learn more about
side effects
that begin during treatment for cancer, visit
Side Effects
.
Side effects from cancer treatment that begin after treatment and continue for months or years are called
late effects
. Late effects of cancer treatment for childhood thyroid cancer may include:
Physical problems, such as changes in the
salivary glands
,
infection
, or trouble breathing.
Changes in mood, feelings, thinking, learning, or memory.
Second cancers
(new types of cancer).
Some late effects may be treated or controlled. It is important to talk with your  child's doctors about the effects cancer treatment can have on your child.  (See the
PDQ
summary on
Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer
for more information.)
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
For some patients, taking part in a
clinical trial
may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer  treatments are safe and effective or better than the
standard treatment
.
Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first  to receive a new treatment.
Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.
Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the
side effects
of cancer treatment.
Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about clinical trials supported by NCI can be found on NCI’s
clinical trials search
webpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the
ClinicalTrials.gov
website.
Follow-up tests may be needed.
It is common for thyroid cancer to
recur
(come back), especially in children younger than 10 years and those with cancer in the lymph nodes.
Ultrasound
, whole-body scan, and
thyroglobulin
tests may be done from time to time to check if the cancer has recurred. Lifelong
follow-up
of thyroid hormone levels in the
blood
is needed to make sure the right amount of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is being given. Talk with your child's doctor to find out how often these tests need to be done.
Treatment of Childhood Papillary and Follicular Thyroid Cancer
For information about the treatments listed below, see the
Treatment Option Overview
section.
Treatment of newly
diagnosed
papillary
and
follicular thyroid carcinoma
in children may include the following:
Surgery
to remove all or most of the
thyroid gland
and sometimes
lymph nodes
near the thyroid gland.
Radioactive iodine
therapy
may also be given if any
thyroid cancer
cells
remain after surgery.
Hormone replacement therapy
(HRT) is given to make up for the lost
thyroid hormone
.
Within 12 weeks of surgery, tests are done to find out if thyroid cancer remains in the body. These may include
thyroglobulin
tests and a whole-body
thyroid
scan
. A whole-body thyroid scan is done to find areas in the body where thyroid cancer cells that were not removed during surgery may be dividing quickly. Radioactive iodine is used because only thyroid cells take up
iodine
. A very small amount of radioactive iodine is swallowed, travels through the
blood
, and collects in thyroid
tissue
and thyroid cancer cells anywhere in the body. If thyroid cancer remains, a large
dose
of radioactive iodine is given to destroy any remaining thyroid cancer cells. A whole-body
SPECT (single photon emission computed tomography) scan
may be done 4 to 7 days after treatment to check whether all of the
cancer
cells have been destroyed.
Radioactive iodine therapy alone may be given to children whose
tumor
cannot be removed by surgery.
Hormone replacement therapy
(HRT) is given to make up for the lost thyroid hormone.

About This PDQ Summary
About PDQ
Physician Data Query (PDQ) is the National Cancer Institute's (NCI's) comprehensive cancer information database. The PDQ database contains summaries of the latest published information on cancer prevention, detection, genetics, treatment, supportive care, and complementary and alternative medicine. Most summaries come in two versions. The health professional versions have detailed information written in technical language. The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language. Both versions have cancer information that is accurate and up to date and most versions are also available in
Spanish
.
PDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal government’s center of biomedical research.  The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH.
Purpose of This Summary
This PDQ cancer information summary has current information about the treatment of childhood thyroid cancer.  It is meant to inform and help patients, families, and caregivers. It does not give formal guidelines or recommendations for making decisions about health care.
Reviewers and Updates
Editorial Boards write the PDQ cancer information summaries and keep them up to date. These Boards are made up of experts in cancer treatment and other specialties related to cancer. The summaries are reviewed regularly and changes are made when there is new information. The date on each summary ("Updated") is the date of the most recent change.
The information in this patient summary was taken from the health professional version, which is reviewed regularly and updated as needed, by the
PDQ Pediatric Treatment Editorial Board
.
Clinical Trial Information
A clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become "standard." Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
Clinical trials can be found online at
NCI's website

Anatomy of the thyroid and parathyroid glands. The thyroid gland lies at the base of the throat near the trachea. It is shaped like a butterfly, with the right lobe and left lobe connected by a thin piece of tissue called the isthmus. The parathyroid glands are four pea-sized organs found in the neck near the thyroid. The thyroid and parathyroid glands make hormones.
The thyroid uses
iodine
, a
mineral
found in some foods and in iodized salt, to help make several
hormones
.
Thyroid hormones
do the following:
Control
heart rate
, body temperature, and how quickly food is changed into energy (
metabolism
).
Control the amount of
calcium
in the
blood
.
Thyroid nodules may be adenomas or carcinomas.
There are two types of thyroid
nodules
:
Adenomas
:
Adenomas can grow very large and sometimes make hormones. Adenomas are not
cancer
but may rarely become
malignant
(cancer) and spread to the
lungs
or
lymph nodes
in the neck.
Carcinomas
:
There are three main types of thyroid carcinoma in children:
Papillary
.
Papillary thyroid carcinoma is the most common type of
thyroid cancer
in children. It occurs most often in teens. Papillary thyroid carcinoma is often made up of more than one nodule on both sides of the thyroid. It often spreads to the lymph nodes in the neck and may also spread to the lung. The
prognosis
(chance of
recovery
) for most patients is very good.
Follicular
.
Follicular thyroid carcinoma is usually made up of one nodule. It often spreads to the bone and lung, but  rarely spreads to the lymph nodes in the neck. The prognosis for most patients is very good.
Medullary
.
Medullary thyroid carcinoma forms from parafollicular
C cells
in the thyroid. It is usually linked to a certain
inherited
change in the
RET
gene
and
multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN 2) syndrome
. It occurs most often in children aged 4 years and younger and may have spread to other parts of the body at the time of
diagnosis
. Children who have MEN2 syndrome may also be at risk of developing
pheochromocytoma
or
hyperparathyroidism
.
Papillary and follicular thyroid cancer are sometimes called
differentiated
thyroid cancer. Medullary and
anaplastic thyroid cancer
are sometimes called poorly differentiated or
undifferentiated
thyroid cancer. Anaplastic thyroid cancer is very rare in children and is not discussed in this summary.
Thyroid nodules may be found during a routine medical exam and are usually not cancer.
Your child’s doctor may find a lump (nodule) in the thyroid during a routine medical exam, or a nodule may be seen on an
imaging test
or during
surgery
for another
condition
. A thyroid nodule is an
abnormal
growth of thyroid
cells
in the thyroid. Nodules may be solid or
fluid
-filled.
When a thyroid nodule is found, an
ultrasound
of the thyroid and lymph nodes in the neck is done. A
fine-needle aspiration biopsy
may be done to check for
signs
of cancer.
Blood tests
to check thyroid hormone levels and for anti-thyroid
antibodies
in the blood may also be done. This is to check for other types of thyroid disease.
Thyroid nodules usually don't cause
symptoms
or need treatment. Sometimes the thyroid nodules become large enough that it is hard to swallow or breathe and more tests and treatment are needed. Only one in five thyroid nodules become cancer.
Being exposed to radiation or having certain genetic syndromes can affect the risk of thyroid cancer.
Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a
risk factor
. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesn’t mean that you will not get cancer. Talk with your doctor if you think your child may be at risk.
Risk factors for childhood thyroid cancer include the following:
Being exposed to
radiation
, such as from
diagnostic tests
,
radiation treatment
, or radiation in the environment.
Having certain
genetic
syndromes, such as the following:
Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A (MEN2A) syndrome
.
Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2B (MEN2B) syndrome
.
Having a
family history
of thyroid cancer, including the following:
APC
-associated
polyposis
.
DICER1 syndrome
.
Carney complex
.
PTEN
hamartoma
tumor
syndrome
.
Werner syndrome
.
Medullary thyroid cancer is sometimes caused by a change in a gene that is passed from parent to child.
The genes in cells carry
hereditary
information from parent to child. A certain change in the
RET
gene that is passed from parent to child (inherited) may cause medullary thyroid cancer.
There is a
genetic test
that is used to check for the changed gene. The patient is tested first to see if he or she has the changed gene. If the patient has it, other family members may also be tested to find out if they have an increased risk of medullary thyroid cancer. Family members, including young children, who have the changed gene may have a
thyroidectomy
(surgery to remove the thyroid). This can decrease the chance of developing medullary thyroid cancer.
Signs of thyroid cancer include a swelling or lump in the neck.
Sometimes thyroid tumors do not cause any signs or symptoms. These and other signs and symptoms may be caused by papillary or follicular thyroid cancer or by other conditions.
Check with your child's doctor if your child has any of the following:
A lump in the neck.
Trouble breathing.
Trouble swallowing.
Hoarseness or a change in the voice.
These and other signs and symptoms may be caused by medullary thyroid cancer or by other conditions.
Check with your child's doctor if your child has any of the following:
Bumps on the lips, tongue, or eyelids that do not hurt.
Trouble making tears.
Constipation
.
Marfan syndrome
(being tall and thin, with long arms, legs, fingers, and toes).
Tests that examine the thyroid, neck, and blood are used to diagnose and stage thyroid cancer.
Tests are done to diagnose and
stage
cancer. After cancer is diagnosed, more tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread to nearby areas or to other parts of the body. This process is called
staging
. Tests done to find out if cancer cells have spread before the tumor is removed by surgery is called preoperative staging. It is important to know whether cancer has spread in order to plan the best treatment.
The following tests and procedures may be used:
Physical exam
and
health history
:
An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps (nodules) or swelling in the neck,
voice box
, and lymph nodes, and anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patient’s health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.
Thyroid function test:
The blood is checked for abnormal levels of
thyroid-stimulating hormone
(TSH). TSH is made by the
pituitary gland
in the
brain
. It stimulates the release of thyroid hormone and controls how fast follicular thyroid cells grow. The blood may also be checked for high levels of
calcitonin
(a hormone made by the thyroid that decreases the amount of
calcium
in the blood).
Thyroglobulin
test:
The blood is checked for the amount of thyroglobulin, a
protein
made by the
thyroid gland
. Thyroglobulin levels are low or absent with normal thyroid function but may be higher with thyroid cancer or other conditions.
RET
gene test:
A
laboratory test
in which a sample of blood or
tissue
is tested for certain changes in the
RET
gene. This test is done for children who may have medullary thyroid cancer.
Ultrasound
exam:
A procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal tissues or
organs
in the neck and make echoes. The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a
sonogram
. The picture can be printed to be looked at later. This procedure can show the size of a thyroid nodule and whether it is solid or a fluid-filled
cyst
. Ultrasound may be used to guide a fine-needle aspiration biopsy. A complete ultrasound exam of the neck is done before surgery.
Thyroid
scan
: A small amount of a
radioactive
substance is swallowed or
injected
. The radioactive material collects in thyroid gland cells. A special camera linked to a computer detects the radiation given off and makes pictures that show how the thyroid looks and functions and whether the cancer has spread beyond the thyroid gland. If the amount of TSH in the child's blood is low, a scan to make images of the thyroid may be done before surgery.
CT scan
(CAT scan):
A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the neck, chest,
abdomen
, and brain, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an
x-ray
machine. A
dye
may be injected into a
vein
or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.
Enlarge
Computed tomography (CT) scan of the head and neck. The child lies on a table that slides through the CT scanner, which takes a series of detailed x-ray pictures of the inside of the head and neck.
MRI
(magnetic resonance imaging) with
gadolinium
: A procedure that uses a magnet,
radio waves
, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the neck and chest. A substance called gadolinium is injected into a vein. The gadolinium collects around the cancer cells so they show up brighter in the picture. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).
Chest x-ray
: An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest. An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.
Fine-needle aspiration biopsy:
The removal of thyroid tissue using a thin needle. The needle is inserted through the skin into the thyroid. Several tissue samples are removed from different parts of the thyroid. A
pathologist
views the tissue samples under a
microscope
to look for cancer cells. Because the type of thyroid cancer can be hard to diagnose, patients should ask to have
biopsy samples
checked by a pathologist who has experience diagnosing thyroid cancer. If it is not clear whether cancer is present, a
surgical biopsy
may be done.
Surgical biopsy:
The removal of the thyroid nodule or one lobe of the thyroid during surgery so the cells and tissues can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer. Because the type of thyroid cancer can be hard to diagnose, patients should ask to have biopsy samples checked by a pathologist who has experience diagnosing thyroid cancer.
Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery).
The prognosis depends on the following:
The age of the child at the time of diagnosis.
The type of thyroid cancer.
The size of the cancer.
Whether the tumor has spread to lymph nodes or other parts of the body at the time of diagnosis.
Whether the cancer was completely removed by surgery.
The child's general health.
Stages of Childhood Thyroid Cancer
Key Points
After the cancer has been removed by surgery, tests are done to find out if cancer cells remain in the body.
There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.
Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.
Sometimes childhood thyroid cancer  continues to grow or comes back after treatment.
After the cancer has been removed by surgery, tests are done to find out if cancer cells remain in the body.
Tests are done after
surgery
to find out if
cancer
cells
remain and to determine if more treatment is needed. This is called
postoperative
staging
.
The following tests and procedures may be done about 12 weeks after surgery:
Ultrasound
exam
: A procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal
tissues
or
organs
in the neck and make echoes. The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a
sonogram
. The picture can be printed to be looked at later. This procedure can show the size of a
thyroid
nodule
and whether it is solid or a
fluid
-filled
cyst
. Ultrasound may be used to guide a
fine-needle aspiration biopsy
. A complete ultrasound exam of the neck is done before surgery.
Thyroglobulin
test
: A test that measures the amount of thyroglobulin in the
blood
. Thyroglobulin is a
protein
made by the
thyroid gland
. Thyroglobulin levels are low or absent with normal thyroid function but may be higher with
thyroid cancer
or other
conditions
.
Whole-body thyroid
scan
: A small amount of
radioactive
substance is swallowed or
injected
. The radioactive material collects in any thyroid tissue or cancer cells remaining after surgery.
Radioactive iodine
is used because only thyroid cells take up
iodine
. A special camera detects the
radiation
given off by the thyroid tissue or cancer cells, also called radioactive iodine scan or RAI scan.
There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.
Cancer can spread through
tissue
, the
lymph system
, and the
blood
:
Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.
Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the
lymph vessels
to other parts of the body.
Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the
blood vessels
to other parts of the body.
Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.
When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called
metastasis
. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the
primary tumor
) and travel through the lymph system or blood.
Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a
tumor
(
metastatic
tumor) in another part of the body.
Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.
The
metastatic
tumor is the same type of cancer as the
primary tumor
. For example, if thyroid cancer spreads to the
lung
, the cancer cells in the lung are actually thyroid cancer cells. The disease is metastatic thyroid cancer, not
lung cancer
.
Many cancer deaths are caused when cancer moves from the original tumor and spreads to other tissues and organs. This is called metastatic cancer. This animation shows how cancer cells travel from the place in the body where they first formed to other parts of the body.
Sometimes childhood thyroid cancer  continues to grow or comes back after treatment.
Progressive
thyroid cancer is cancer that continues to grow, spread, or get worse.  Progressive disease may be a
sign
that the cancer has become
refractory
to treatment.
Recurrent
thyroid cancer is cancer that has
recurred
(come back) after treatment. The cancer may come back in the thyroid or in other parts of the body.
Treatment Option Overview
Key Points
There are different types of treatment for patients with thyroid cancer.
Children with thyroid cancer should have their treatment planned by a team of doctors who are experts in treating childhood cancer.
Four types of standard treatment are used:
Surgery
Radioactive iodine therapy
Targeted therapy
Hormone replacement therapy
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
Treatment for childhood thyroid cancer may cause side effects.
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
Follow-up tests may be needed.
There are different types of treatment for patients with thyroid cancer.
Some treatments are
standard
(the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in
clinical trials
.  A treatment clinical trial is a
research study
meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the  standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment.
Because cancer in children is rare, taking part in a clinical trial should be considered.  Some clinical trials are open only to patients  who have not started treatment.
Children with thyroid cancer should have their treatment planned by a team of doctors who are experts in treating childhood cancer.
A pediatric oncologist, a doctor who specializes in treating children with cancer, oversees treatment for cancer. The pediatric oncologist works with other health care providers who are experts in treating children with cancer and also specialize in other areas of medicine. Other specialists may include:
pediatrician
pediatric surgeon
radiation oncologist
pathologist
pediatric nurse specialist
social worker
rehabilitation specialist
psychologist
child-life specialist
Four types of standard treatment are used:
Surgery
Surgery
is the most common treatment for
thyroid cancer
. One of the following procedures may be used:
Total
thyroidectomy
: Removal of the whole
thyroid
.
Lymph nodes
near the
cancer
may also be removed and checked under a
microscope
for
signs
of cancer.
Near-total thyroidectomy: Removal of all but a very small part of the thyroid. Lymph nodes near the cancer may also be removed and checked under a microscope for signs of cancer.
In children, a total thyroidectomy is usually done.
Radioactive iodine therapy
Follicular
and
papillary thyroid cancers
are sometimes treated with
radioactive iodine
(RAI) therapy. RAI therapy may be given to children after surgery to kill any thyroid cancer
cells
that were not removed or to children whose
tumor
cannot be removed by surgery. RAI is taken by mouth and collects in any remaining thyroid
tissue
, including thyroid cancer cells that have spread to other places in the body. Because only thyroid tissue takes up
iodine
, the RAI destroys thyroid tissue and thyroid cancer cells without harming other tissue. Before a full treatment
dose
of RAI is given, a small test dose is given to see if the tumor takes up the iodine.
Targeted therapy
Targeted therapy
is a type of treatment that uses
drugs
or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells. Targeted therapies usually cause less harm to normal cells than
chemotherapy
or
radiation therapy
do.
Tyrosine kinase inhibitor
therapy (TKI) is a type of targeted therapy that blocks signals needed for tumors to grow.
Larotrectinib
and
entrectinib
are TKIs used to treat children with progressive or recurrent papillary and follicular thyroid cancer.
Vandetanib
is a TKI used to treat children with
advanced
medullary thyroid cancer
.
Selpercatinib
is a TKI used to treat children with advanced or metastatic thyroid cancer.
Targeted therapy is being studied for the treatment of childhood thyroid cancer that has
recurred
(come back).
Hormone replacement therapy
Hormones
are substances made by
glands
in the body and circulated in the bloodstream. After treatment for thyroid cancer, the thyroid is not able to make enough
thyroid hormone
. Patients are given thyroid
hormone replacement
pills for the rest of their lives.
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
Information about
clinical trials
is available from the
NCI website
.
Treatment for childhood thyroid cancer may cause side effects.
To learn more about
side effects
that begin during treatment for cancer, visit
Side Effects
.
Side effects from cancer treatment that begin after treatment and continue for months or years are called
late effects
. Late effects of cancer treatment for childhood thyroid cancer may include:
Physical problems, such as changes in the
salivary glands
,
infection
, or trouble breathing.
Changes in mood, feelings, thinking, learning, or memory.
Second cancers
(new types of cancer).
Some late effects may be treated or controlled. It is important to talk with your  child's doctors about the effects cancer treatment can have on your child.  (See the
PDQ
summary on
Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer
for more information.)
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
For some patients, taking part in a
clinical trial
may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer  treatments are safe and effective or better than the
standard treatment
.
Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first  to receive a new treatment.
Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.
Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the
side effects
of cancer treatment.
Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about clinical trials supported by NCI can be found on NCI’s
clinical trials search
webpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the
ClinicalTrials.gov
website.
Follow-up tests may be needed.
It is common for thyroid cancer to
recur
(come back), especially in children younger than 10 years and those with cancer in the lymph nodes.
Ultrasound
, whole-body scan, and
thyroglobulin
tests may be done from time to time to check if the cancer has recurred. Lifelong
follow-up
of thyroid hormone levels in the
blood
is needed to make sure the right amount of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is being given. Talk with your child's doctor to find out how often these tests need to be done.
Treatment of Childhood Papillary and Follicular Thyroid Cancer
For information about the treatments listed below, see the
Treatment Option Overview
section.
Treatment of newly
diagnosed
papillary
and
follicular thyroid carcinoma
in children may include the following:
Surgery
to remove all or most of the
thyroid gland
and sometimes
lymph nodes
near the thyroid gland.
Radioactive iodine
therapy
may also be given if any
thyroid cancer
cells
remain after surgery.
Hormone replacement therapy
(HRT) is given to make up for the lost
thyroid hormone
.
Within 12 weeks of surgery, tests are done to find out if thyroid cancer remains in the body. These may include
thyroglobulin
tests and a whole-body
thyroid
scan
. A whole-body thyroid scan is done to find areas in the body where thyroid cancer cells that were not removed during surgery may be dividing quickly. Radioactive iodine is used because only thyroid cells take up
iodine
. A very small amount of radioactive iodine is swallowed, travels through the
blood
, and collects in thyroid
tissue
and thyroid cancer cells anywhere in the body. If thyroid cancer remains, a large
dose
of radioactive iodine is given to destroy any remaining thyroid cancer cells. A whole-body
SPECT (single photon emission computed tomography) scan
may be done 4 to 7 days after treatment to check whether all of the
cancer
cells have been destroyed.
Radioactive iodine therapy alone may be given to children whose
tumor
cannot be removed by surgery.
Hormone replacement therapy
(HRT) is given to make up for the lost thyroid hormone.

About This PDQ Summary
About PDQ
Physician Data Query (PDQ) is the National Cancer Institute's (NCI's) comprehensive cancer information database. The PDQ database contains summaries of the latest published information on cancer prevention, detection, genetics, treatment, supportive care, and complementary and alternative medicine. Most summaries come in two versions. The health professional versions have detailed information written in technical language. The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language. Both versions have cancer information that is accurate and up to date and most versions are also available in
Spanish
.
PDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal government’s center of biomedical research.  The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH.
Purpose of This Summary
This PDQ cancer information summary has current information about the treatment of childhood thyroid cancer.  It is meant to inform and help patients, families, and caregivers. It does not give formal guidelines or recommendations for making decisions about health care.
Reviewers and Updates
Editorial Boards write the PDQ cancer information summaries and keep them up to date. These Boards are made up of experts in cancer treatment and other specialties related to cancer. The summaries are reviewed regularly and changes are made when there is new information. The date on each summary ("Updated") is the date of the most recent change.
The information in this patient summary was taken from the health professional version, which is reviewed regularly and updated as needed, by the
PDQ Pediatric Treatment Editorial Board

Clinical Trial Information
A clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become "standard." Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
Clinical trials can be found online at
NCI's website

Key Points
Thyroid cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the thyroid gland.
Thyroid nodules may be adenomas or carcinomas.
Thyroid nodules may be found during a routine medical exam and are usually not cancer.
Being exposed to radiation or having certain genetic syndromes can affect the risk of thyroid cancer.
Medullary thyroid cancer is sometimes caused by a change in a gene that is passed from parent to child.
Signs of thyroid cancer include a swelling or lump in the neck.
Tests that examine the thyroid, neck, and blood are used to diagnose and stage thyroid cancer.
Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery).
Thyroid cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the thyroid gland.
The
thyroid
is a
gland
at the base of the
throat
near the
trachea
(windpipe). It is shaped like a butterfly, with a right
lobe
and a left lobe. The
isthmus
is a thin piece of
tissue
that connects the two lobes. It usually cannot be felt through the skin.

Anatomy of the thyroid and parathyroid glands. The thyroid gland lies at the base of the throat near the trachea. It is shaped like a butterfly, with the right lobe and left lobe connected by a thin piece of tissue called the isthmus. The parathyroid glands are four pea-sized organs found in the neck near the thyroid. The thyroid and parathyroid glands make hormones.
The thyroid uses
iodine
, a
mineral
found in some foods and in iodized salt, to help make several
hormones
.
Thyroid hormones
do the following:
Control
heart rate
, body temperature, and how quickly food is changed into energy (
metabolism
).
Control the amount of
calcium
in the
blood
.
Thyroid nodules may be adenomas or carcinomas.
There are two types of thyroid
nodules
:
Adenomas
:
Adenomas can grow very large and sometimes make hormones. Adenomas are not
cancer
but may rarely become
malignant
(cancer) and spread to the
lungs
or
lymph nodes
in the neck.
Carcinomas
:
There are three main types of thyroid carcinoma in children:
Papillary
.
Papillary thyroid carcinoma is the most common type of
thyroid cancer
in children. It occurs most often in teens. Papillary thyroid carcinoma is often made up of more than one nodule on both sides of the thyroid. It often spreads to the lymph nodes in the neck and may also spread to the lung. The
prognosis
(chance of
recovery
) for most patients is very good.
Follicular
.
Follicular thyroid carcinoma is usually made up of one nodule. It often spreads to the bone and lung, but  rarely spreads to the lymph nodes in the neck. The prognosis for most patients is very good.
Medullary
.
Medullary thyroid carcinoma forms from parafollicular
C cells
in the thyroid. It is usually linked to a certain
inherited
change in the
RET
gene
and
multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN 2) syndrome
. It occurs most often in children aged 4 years and younger and may have spread to other parts of the body at the time of
diagnosis
. Children who have MEN2 syndrome may also be at risk of developing
pheochromocytoma
or
hyperparathyroidism
.
Papillary and follicular thyroid cancer are sometimes called
differentiated
thyroid cancer. Medullary and
anaplastic thyroid cancer
are sometimes called poorly differentiated or
undifferentiated
thyroid cancer. Anaplastic thyroid cancer is very rare in children and is not discussed in this summary.
Thyroid nodules may be found during a routine medical exam and are usually not cancer.
Your child’s doctor may find a lump (nodule) in the thyroid during a routine medical exam, or a nodule may be seen on an
imaging test
or during
surgery
for another
condition
. A thyroid nodule is an
abnormal
growth of thyroid
cells
in the thyroid. Nodules may be solid or
fluid
-filled.
When a thyroid nodule is found, an
ultrasound
of the thyroid and lymph nodes in the neck is done. A
fine-needle aspiration biopsy
may be done to check for
signs
of cancer.
Blood tests
to check thyroid hormone levels and for anti-thyroid
antibodies
in the blood may also be done. This is to check for other types of thyroid disease.
Thyroid nodules usually don't cause
symptoms
or need treatment. Sometimes the thyroid nodules become large enough that it is hard to swallow or breathe and more tests and treatment are needed. Only one in five thyroid nodules become cancer.
Being exposed to radiation or having certain genetic syndromes can affect the risk of thyroid cancer.
Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a
risk factor
. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesn’t mean that you will not get cancer. Talk with your doctor if you think your child may be at risk.
Risk factors for childhood thyroid cancer include the following:
Being exposed to
radiation
, such as from
diagnostic tests
,
radiation treatment
, or radiation in the environment.
Having certain
genetic
syndromes, such as the following:
Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A (MEN2A) syndrome
.
Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2B (MEN2B) syndrome
.
Having a
family history
of thyroid cancer, including the following:
APC
-associated
polyposis
.
DICER1 syndrome
.
Carney complex
.
PTEN
hamartoma
tumor
syndrome
.
Werner syndrome
.
Medullary thyroid cancer is sometimes caused by a change in a gene that is passed from parent to child.
The genes in cells carry
hereditary
information from parent to child. A certain change in the
RET
gene that is passed from parent to child (inherited) may cause medullary thyroid cancer.
There is a
genetic test
that is used to check for the changed gene. The patient is tested first to see if he or she has the changed gene. If the patient has it, other family members may also be tested to find out if they have an increased risk of medullary thyroid cancer. Family members, including young children, who have the changed gene may have a
thyroidectomy
(surgery to remove the thyroid). This can decrease the chance of developing medullary thyroid cancer.
Signs of thyroid cancer include a swelling or lump in the neck.
Sometimes thyroid tumors do not cause any signs or symptoms. These and other signs and symptoms may be caused by papillary or follicular thyroid cancer or by other conditions.
Check with your child's doctor if your child has any of the following:
A lump in the neck.
Trouble breathing.
Trouble swallowing.
Hoarseness or a change in the voice.
These and other signs and symptoms may be caused by medullary thyroid cancer or by other conditions.
Check with your child's doctor if your child has any of the following:
Bumps on the lips, tongue, or eyelids that do not hurt.
Trouble making tears.
Constipation
.
Marfan syndrome
(being tall and thin, with long arms, legs, fingers, and toes).
Tests that examine the thyroid, neck, and blood are used to diagnose and stage thyroid cancer.
Tests are done to diagnose and
stage
cancer. After cancer is diagnosed, more tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread to nearby areas or to other parts of the body. This process is called
staging
. Tests done to find out if cancer cells have spread before the tumor is removed by surgery is called preoperative staging. It is important to know whether cancer has spread in order to plan the best treatment.
The following tests and procedures may be used:
Physical exam
and
health history
:
An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps (nodules) or swelling in the neck,
voice box
, and lymph nodes, and anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patient’s health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.
Thyroid function test:
The blood is checked for abnormal levels of
thyroid-stimulating hormone
(TSH). TSH is made by the
pituitary gland
in the
brain
. It stimulates the release of thyroid hormone and controls how fast follicular thyroid cells grow. The blood may also be checked for high levels of
calcitonin
(a hormone made by the thyroid that decreases the amount of
calcium
in the blood).
Thyroglobulin
test:
The blood is checked for the amount of thyroglobulin, a
protein
made by the
thyroid gland
. Thyroglobulin levels are low or absent with normal thyroid function but may be higher with thyroid cancer or other conditions.
RET
gene test:
A
laboratory test
in which a sample of blood or
tissue
is tested for certain changes in the
RET
gene. This test is done for children who may have medullary thyroid cancer.
Ultrasound
exam:
A procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal tissues or
organs
in the neck and make echoes. The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a
sonogram
. The picture can be printed to be looked at later. This procedure can show the size of a thyroid nodule and whether it is solid or a fluid-filled
cyst
. Ultrasound may be used to guide a fine-needle aspiration biopsy. A complete ultrasound exam of the neck is done before surgery.
Thyroid
scan
: A small amount of a
radioactive
substance is swallowed or
injected
. The radioactive material collects in thyroid gland cells. A special camera linked to a computer detects the radiation given off and makes pictures that show how the thyroid looks and functions and whether the cancer has spread beyond the thyroid gland. If the amount of TSH in the child's blood is low, a scan to make images of the thyroid may be done before surgery.
CT scan
(CAT scan):
A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the neck, chest,
abdomen
, and brain, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an
x-ray
machine. A
dye
may be injected into a
vein
or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.
Enlarge
Computed tomography (CT) scan of the head and neck. The child lies on a table that slides through the CT scanner, which takes a series of detailed x-ray pictures of the inside of the head and neck.
MRI
(magnetic resonance imaging) with
gadolinium
: A procedure that uses a magnet,
radio waves
, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the neck and chest. A substance called gadolinium is injected into a vein. The gadolinium collects around the cancer cells so they show up brighter in the picture. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).
Chest x-ray
: An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest. An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.
Fine-needle aspiration biopsy:
The removal of thyroid tissue using a thin needle. The needle is inserted through the skin into the thyroid. Several tissue samples are removed from different parts of the thyroid. A
pathologist
views the tissue samples under a
microscope
to look for cancer cells. Because the type of thyroid cancer can be hard to diagnose, patients should ask to have
biopsy samples
checked by a pathologist who has experience diagnosing thyroid cancer. If it is not clear whether cancer is present, a
surgical biopsy
may be done.
Surgical biopsy:
The removal of the thyroid nodule or one lobe of the thyroid during surgery so the cells and tissues can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer. Because the type of thyroid cancer can be hard to diagnose, patients should ask to have biopsy samples checked by a pathologist who has experience diagnosing thyroid cancer.
Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery).
The prognosis depends on the following:
The age of the child at the time of diagnosis.
The type of thyroid cancer.
The size of the cancer.
Whether the tumor has spread to lymph nodes or other parts of the body at the time of diagnosis.
Whether the cancer was completely removed by surgery.
The child's general health.
Stages of Childhood Thyroid Cancer
Key Points
After the cancer has been removed by surgery, tests are done to find out if cancer cells remain in the body.
There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.
Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.
Sometimes childhood thyroid cancer  continues to grow or comes back after treatment.
After the cancer has been removed by surgery, tests are done to find out if cancer cells remain in the body.
Tests are done after
surgery
to find out if
cancer
cells
remain and to determine if more treatment is needed. This is called
postoperative
staging
.
The following tests and procedures may be done about 12 weeks after surgery:
Ultrasound
exam
: A procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal
tissues
or
organs
in the neck and make echoes. The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a
sonogram
. The picture can be printed to be looked at later. This procedure can show the size of a
thyroid
nodule
and whether it is solid or a
fluid
-filled
cyst
. Ultrasound may be used to guide a
fine-needle aspiration biopsy
. A complete ultrasound exam of the neck is done before surgery.
Thyroglobulin
test
: A test that measures the amount of thyroglobulin in the
blood
. Thyroglobulin is a
protein
made by the
thyroid gland
. Thyroglobulin levels are low or absent with normal thyroid function but may be higher with
thyroid cancer
or other
conditions
.
Whole-body thyroid
scan
: A small amount of
radioactive
substance is swallowed or
injected
. The radioactive material collects in any thyroid tissue or cancer cells remaining after surgery.
Radioactive iodine
is used because only thyroid cells take up
iodine
. A special camera detects the
radiation
given off by the thyroid tissue or cancer cells, also called radioactive iodine scan or RAI scan.
There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.
Cancer can spread through
tissue
, the
lymph system
, and the
blood
:
Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.
Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the
lymph vessels
to other parts of the body.
Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the
blood vessels
to other parts of the body.
Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.
When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called
metastasis
. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the
primary tumor
) and travel through the lymph system or blood.
Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a
tumor
(
metastatic
tumor) in another part of the body.
Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.
The
metastatic
tumor is the same type of cancer as the
primary tumor
. For example, if thyroid cancer spreads to the
lung
, the cancer cells in the lung are actually thyroid cancer cells. The disease is metastatic thyroid cancer, not
lung cancer
.
Many cancer deaths are caused when cancer moves from the original tumor and spreads to other tissues and organs. This is called metastatic cancer. This animation shows how cancer cells travel from the place in the body where they first formed to other parts of the body.
Sometimes childhood thyroid cancer  continues to grow or comes back after treatment.
Progressive
thyroid cancer is cancer that continues to grow, spread, or get worse.  Progressive disease may be a
sign
that the cancer has become
refractory
to treatment.
Recurrent
thyroid cancer is cancer that has
recurred
(come back) after treatment. The cancer may come back in the thyroid or in other parts of the body.
Treatment Option Overview
Key Points
There are different types of treatment for patients with thyroid cancer.
Children with thyroid cancer should have their treatment planned by a team of doctors who are experts in treating childhood cancer.
Four types of standard treatment are used:
Surgery
Radioactive iodine therapy
Targeted therapy
Hormone replacement therapy
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
Treatment for childhood thyroid cancer may cause side effects.
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
Follow-up tests may be needed.
There are different types of treatment for patients with thyroid cancer.
Some treatments are
standard
(the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in
clinical trials
.  A treatment clinical trial is a
research study
meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the  standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment.
Because cancer in children is rare, taking part in a clinical trial should be considered.  Some clinical trials are open only to patients  who have not started treatment.
Children with thyroid cancer should have their treatment planned by a team of doctors who are experts in treating childhood cancer.
A pediatric oncologist, a doctor who specializes in treating children with cancer, oversees treatment for cancer. The pediatric oncologist works with other health care providers who are experts in treating children with cancer and also specialize in other areas of medicine. Other specialists may include:
pediatrician
pediatric surgeon
radiation oncologist
pathologist
pediatric nurse specialist
social worker
rehabilitation specialist
psychologist
child-life specialist
Four types of standard treatment are used:
Surgery
Surgery
is the most common treatment for
thyroid cancer
. One of the following procedures may be used:
Total
thyroidectomy
: Removal of the whole
thyroid
.
Lymph nodes
near the
cancer
may also be removed and checked under a
microscope
for
signs
of cancer.
Near-total thyroidectomy: Removal of all but a very small part of the thyroid. Lymph nodes near the cancer may also be removed and checked under a microscope for signs of cancer.
In children, a total thyroidectomy is usually done.
Radioactive iodine therapy
Follicular
and
papillary thyroid cancers
are sometimes treated with
radioactive iodine
(RAI) therapy. RAI therapy may be given to children after surgery to kill any thyroid cancer
cells
that were not removed or to children whose
tumor
cannot be removed by surgery. RAI is taken by mouth and collects in any remaining thyroid
tissue
, including thyroid cancer cells that have spread to other places in the body. Because only thyroid tissue takes up
iodine
, the RAI destroys thyroid tissue and thyroid cancer cells without harming other tissue. Before a full treatment
dose
of RAI is given, a small test dose is given to see if the tumor takes up the iodine.
Targeted therapy
Targeted therapy
is a type of treatment that uses
drugs
or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells. Targeted therapies usually cause less harm to normal cells than
chemotherapy
or
radiation therapy
do.
Tyrosine kinase inhibitor
therapy (TKI) is a type of targeted therapy that blocks signals needed for tumors to grow.
Larotrectinib
and
entrectinib
are TKIs used to treat children with progressive or recurrent papillary and follicular thyroid cancer.
Vandetanib
is a TKI used to treat children with
advanced
medullary thyroid cancer
.
Selpercatinib
is a TKI used to treat children with advanced or metastatic thyroid cancer.
Targeted therapy is being studied for the treatment of childhood thyroid cancer that has
recurred
(come back).
Hormone replacement therapy
Hormones
are substances made by
glands
in the body and circulated in the bloodstream. After treatment for thyroid cancer, the thyroid is not able to make enough
thyroid hormone
. Patients are given thyroid
hormone replacement
pills for the rest of their lives.
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
Information about
clinical trials
is available from the
NCI website
.
Treatment for childhood thyroid cancer may cause side effects.
To learn more about
side effects
that begin during treatment for cancer, visit
Side Effects
.
Side effects from cancer treatment that begin after treatment and continue for months or years are called
late effects
. Late effects of cancer treatment for childhood thyroid cancer may include:
Physical problems, such as changes in the
salivary glands
,
infection
, or trouble breathing.
Changes in mood, feelings, thinking, learning, or memory.
Second cancers
(new types of cancer).
Some late effects may be treated or controlled. It is important to talk with your  child's doctors about the effects cancer treatment can have on your child.  (See the
PDQ
summary on
Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer
for more information.)
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
For some patients, taking part in a
clinical trial
may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer  treatments are safe and effective or better than the
standard treatment
.
Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first  to receive a new treatment.
Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.
Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the
side effects
of cancer treatment.
Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about clinical trials supported by NCI can be found on NCI’s
clinical trials search
webpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the
ClinicalTrials.gov
website.
Follow-up tests may be needed.
It is common for thyroid cancer to
recur
(come back), especially in children younger than 10 years and those with cancer in the lymph nodes.
Ultrasound
, whole-body scan, and
thyroglobulin
tests may be done from time to time to check if the cancer has recurred. Lifelong
follow-up
of thyroid hormone levels in the
blood
is needed to make sure the right amount of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is being given. Talk with your child's doctor to find out how often these tests need to be done.
Treatment of Childhood Papillary and Follicular Thyroid Cancer
For information about the treatments listed below, see the
Treatment Option Overview
section.
Treatment of newly
diagnosed
papillary
and
follicular thyroid carcinoma
in children may include the following:
Surgery
to remove all or most of the
thyroid gland
and sometimes
lymph nodes
near the thyroid gland.
Radioactive iodine
therapy
may also be given if any
thyroid cancer
cells
remain after surgery.
Hormone replacement therapy
(HRT) is given to make up for the lost
thyroid hormone
.
Within 12 weeks of surgery, tests are done to find out if thyroid cancer remains in the body. These may include
thyroglobulin
tests and a whole-body
thyroid
scan
. A whole-body thyroid scan is done to find areas in the body where thyroid cancer cells that were not removed during surgery may be dividing quickly. Radioactive iodine is used because only thyroid cells take up
iodine
. A very small amount of radioactive iodine is swallowed, travels through the
blood
, and collects in thyroid
tissue
and thyroid cancer cells anywhere in the body. If thyroid cancer remains, a large
dose
of radioactive iodine is given to destroy any remaining thyroid cancer cells. A whole-body
SPECT (single photon emission computed tomography) scan
may be done 4 to 7 days after treatment to check whether all of the
cancer
cells have been destroyed.
Radioactive iodine therapy alone may be given to children whose
tumor
cannot be removed by surgery.
Hormone replacement therapy
(HRT) is given to make up for the lost thyroid hormone.

About This PDQ Summary
About PDQ
Physician Data Query (PDQ) is the National Cancer Institute's (NCI's) comprehensive cancer information database. The PDQ database contains summaries of the latest published information on cancer prevention, detection, genetics, treatment, supportive care, and complementary and alternative medicine. Most summaries come in two versions. The health professional versions have detailed information written in technical language. The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language. Both versions have cancer information that is accurate and up to date and most versions are also available in
Spanish
.
PDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal government’s center of biomedical research.  The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH.
Purpose of This Summary
This PDQ cancer information summary has current information about the treatment of childhood thyroid cancer.  It is meant to inform and help patients, families, and caregivers. It does not give formal guidelines or recommendations for making decisions about health care.
Reviewers and Updates
Editorial Boards write the PDQ cancer information summaries and keep them up to date. These Boards are made up of experts in cancer treatment and other specialties related to cancer. The summaries are reviewed regularly and changes are made when there is new information. The date on each summary ("Updated") is the date of the most recent change.
The information in this patient summary was taken from the health professional version, which is reviewed regularly and updated as needed, by the
PDQ Pediatric Treatment Editorial Board
.
Clinical Trial Information
A clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become "standard." Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
Clinical trials can be found online at
NCI's website
. For more information, call the
Cancer Information Service
(CIS), NCI's contact center, at 1-800-4-CANCER (1-800-422-6237).
