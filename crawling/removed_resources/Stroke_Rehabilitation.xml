Summary
A
stroke
can cause lasting brain damage. People who survive a stroke need to relearn skills they lost because of the damage. Rehabilitation can help them relearn those skills.
The effects of a stroke depend on which area of the brain was damaged. The types of disabilities a stroke can cause include:
Paralysis
or problems controlling movement
Pain and other problems with the senses
Problems using or understanding
language
Problems with thinking and memory
Emotional disturbances
Stroke rehabilitation involves many kinds of health professionals. The goal is to help stroke survivors become as independent as possible and to have the best possible quality of life.
