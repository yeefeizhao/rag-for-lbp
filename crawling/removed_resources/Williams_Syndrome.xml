What is Williams syndrome?
Williams syndrome (WS) is a rare genetic disorder. People with WS may have mild to moderate delays in their cognitive development (ability to think and reason) or learning difficulties. They also may have a distinctive facial appearance, and a unique personality that combines over-friendliness and high levels of empathy with anxiety.
The most significant medical problem that occurs with WS is cardiovascular (heart) disease caused by narrowed arteries. Infants with WS may also have elevated levels of blood calcium.

Learn About Clinical Trials
Clinical trials are studies that allow us to learn more about disorders and improve care. They can help connect patients with new and upcoming treatment options.
How can I or my loved one help improve care for people with Williams syndrome?
WS
is considered a rare disease, which often means there is not much information known about it. This is usually the case because doctors and researchers do not see many people with WS, which makes it hard to learn from them through observations or large studies.
Consider participating in a clinical trial so clinicians and scientists can learn more about
WS
and related disorders.  Clinical research uses human volunteers to help researchers learn more about a disorder and perhaps find better ways to safely detect, treat, or prevent disease.
All types of volunteers are needed—
those who are healthy or may have an illness or disease—
of all different ages, sexes, races, and ethnicities to ensure that study results apply to as many people as possible, and that treatments will be safe and effective for everyone who will use them.
