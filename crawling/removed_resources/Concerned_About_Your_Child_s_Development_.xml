Ask About Developmental Screening

Ask For a Referral
If you or the doctor thinks there might be a delay, ask the doctor for a referral to a specialist who can do a more in-depth evaluation of your child.
Doctors your child might be referred to include:
Developmental pediatricians. These doctors have special training in child development and children with special needs.
Child neurologists. These doctors work on the brain, spine, and nerves.
Child psychologists or psychiatrists. These doctors know about the human mind.
Get an Evaluation
At the same time as you ask the doctor for a referral to a specialist, call your state’s public early childhood system to request a free evaluation to find out if your child qualifies for intervention services. This is sometimes called a
Child Find
evaluation. You do not need to wait for a doctor’s referral or a medical diagnosis to make this call. Where to call for a free evaluation from the state depends on your child’s age:
Children 0-3 Years Old
If your child is younger than 3 years old, contact
your local early intervention system

Children 3 Years Old or Older
If your child is age 3 or older, call any local public elementary school (even if your child does not go to school there) and say:
“I have concerns about my child’s development and I would like to have my child evaluated through the school system for preschool special education services.”
If the person who answers is unfamiliar with preschool special education, ask to speak with the school or district’s special education director.
