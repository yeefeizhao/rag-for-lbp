heart disease
. A heart-healthy diet and physical activity can help you maintain good health and reduce your risk of future heart problems.
Good nutrition and weight control are a crucial part of your treatment plan because they help reduce your
risk of heart attack
and
stroke
. If you are overweight, even modest weight loss of 5% to 10% of your body weight can improve your health. Losing more weight can produce greater health benefits.
Healthy eating goals
Here are five healthy eating goals everyone can agree on — even the experts! Try to add these healthy habits to your daily life over the next couple of weeks:
Eat more fruits and vegetables.
Any expert will tell you fruits and vegetables are healthy foods. And most of us don’t eat enough of them.
Eat more whole-grain foods.
Whole-grain foods are low in saturated fat and high in fiber. Whole-grain foods include whole-wheat bread, rye bread, brown rice and whole-grain cereal.
Use healthier oils and sprays as your main kitchen fats.
Not all fats are bad for us. Some fats, such as olive, canola, corn and safflower oils, are quite good due to the higher polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fatty acid content, especially when used to replace solid fats (saturated fat).
Eat more chicken, fish and beans than red meat.
In general, skinless poultry, fish and vegetable protein, such as beans, are lower in saturated fat than meat, such as beef, pork and lamb.
Read food labels to help you choose healthier foods.
Learn what information to look for, such as calories, sodium, saturated fat and trans fat.
The right foods and regular physical activity help you:
Control blood sugar
.
Lower blood cholesterol
.
Control blood pressure
.
Lose weight
and avoid gaining weight.
