Cardiac rehabilitation (rehab) is a program that helps you live better with heart disease. It is often prescribed to help you recover from a heart attack, heart surgery, or other procedures, or if you have heart failure.
These programs most often include both education and exercise. The goal of cardiac rehab is to:
Improve your cardiovascular function
Improve your overall health and quality of life
Reduce your symptoms
Reduce your risk of future heart problems
Who Needs Rehab
Cardiac rehab can help anyone who has had a heart attack or other heart problem. You might consider cardiac rehab if you have had:
Heart attack
Coronary heart disease (CHD)
Heart failure
Angina (chest pain)
Heart or heart valve surgery
Heart transplant
Procedures such as angioplasty and stenting
Peripheral arterial disease
In some cases, your health care provider may refer you to rehab if you have had a heart attack or heart surgery. If your provider does not mention rehab, you can ask if it might help you.

What to Expect
You will work with a rehab team that may include many kinds of medical professionals including:
Heart doctors or specialized providers
Nurses
Dieticians
Physical therapists
Exercise specialists
Occupational therapists
Mental health specialists
Your rehab team will design a program that is safe for you. Before you start, the team will assess your overall health. A provider will do an exam and may ask you questions about your health and medical history. You may also have some tests to check your heart.
Most rehab programs last from 3 to 6 months. Your program may be longer or shorter depending on your condition.
Most rehab programs cover several different areas:
Exercise. Regular exercise helps strengthen your heart and improve your overall health. During your sessions, you may start with about a 5-minute warm-up followed by about 20 minutes of aerobics. The goal is to get to about 70% to 80% of your maximum heart rate. You will then cool down for about 5 to 15 minutes. You may also do some light weightlifting or use weight machines as part of your routine. At first, your team will monitor your heart while you are exercising. You will start slowly and increase your physical activity over time. Your rehab team may also suggest you do other activities, such as walking or yard work, on days you are not at the program.
Healthy eating. Your team will help you learn how to make healthy food choices. They can help you plan a diet to help manage health problems, such as diabetes, obesity, high blood pressure, or high cholesterol.
Education. Your rehab team will teach you other ways to stay healthy, such as quitting smoking. If you have a health condition, such as diabetes, CHD, or high blood pressure, your rehab team will teach you how to manage it.
Support. Your rehab team will help support you in making these lifestyle changes. They can also help you cope with anxiety or depression.
Choosing a Program
If you are in the hospital, your rehab program may start while you are there. Once you go home, you will likely go to a rehab center in your area. It might be in:
The hospital
A skilled nursing faculty
Another location
Your provider may refer you to a rehab center, or you might need to choose one yourself. When choosing a rehab center, keep a few things in mind:
Is the center close to your home?
Is the program at a time that is good for you?
Can you get to the center easily?
Does the program have the services you need?
Is the program covered by your insurance?
If you cannot get to a rehab center, you may have a form of rehab you do in your home.
