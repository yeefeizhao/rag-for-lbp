What are developmental and behavioral screening tests?
Developmental and behavioral screening tests look at how a child is developing. The screenings are made up of checklists and questionnaires for parents. They include questions about their child's language, movement, thinking, behavior, and emotions.
Many of the questions are based on developmental milestones. Developmental milestones are skills and behaviors that show up in
babies
and
children
at certain ages as they grow. They include smiling for the first time, rolling over, and walking. The screening compares your child's milestones to those of other children of the same age. If the screening shows your child is developing at a slower rate, it may be a sign of a
developmental disability
. Developmental disabilities are conditions that cause problems in physical and/or mental functions. They include:
Intellectual disabilities (ID).
These conditions cause below average mental abilities. People with ID often have problems with learning and daily living skills.
Autism spectrum disorder
. This is a disorder that affects behavior, communication, and social skills.
Cerebral palsy
. This is a condition that affects movement, coordination, and balance.
Deafness
or other hearing problems
Developmental and behavioral screening tests don't diagnose these conditions. But a screening can show if your child is not developing on schedule. When developmental disabilities are found and treated early, it can make a big impact on a child's life. Early treatment, known as early intervention, helps children learn important skills, make the most of their strengths, and improve their quality of life.
Other names: Ages and Stages Questionnaire, Parents' Evaluation of Developmental Status (PEDS), Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (M-CHAT), Child Development Inventories (CDI)
What are they used for?
Developmental and behavioral screening tests are used to see if a child is meeting his or her developmental milestones. Below are some examples of milestones for infants and
toddlers
.
Birth to 4 months
Includes smiling, cooing, and bringing hands to mouth.
6 months.
Includes playing with others, looking at themselves in the mirror, sitting without support, and rolling over.
9 months.
Includes making sounds like "mama" and "dada," understanding the word "no," crawling, and pulling to a stand.
1 year.
Includes playing peekaboo, following simple directions, and walking while holding on to furniture.
18 months.
Includes speaking and understanding several words, eating with a spoon, walking, and walking up and down stairs.
2 to 3 years.
Includes recognizing labels and colors, naming pictures of common objects, getting dressed and undressed, and walking and running easily.
Developmental milestones are general guidelines. Children grow at different rates. There is a range in what is considered normal development. But looking at milestones can help identify potential problems early.
Why does my child need a developmental and behavioral screening test?
The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends developmental and behavioral screenings for all children during regular well-child checkups at the following ages:
9 months
18 months
30 months
The AAP also recommends that all children should be
screened for autism spectrum disorder
during regular checkups at 18 and 24 months.
Also, talk to your provider about a screening if you think there is a problem with your child's development. As a parent, you will probably be the first to notice any problems with the way your child interacts, learns, speaks, or moves.
What happens during a development and behavioral screening test?
Screenings may be done by your child's provider and/or by you with guidance from your child's provider.
There are many different types of developmental and behavioral screening tests. Each asks questions about a child's development. You may be asked about your child's social interactions, language skills, and/or gross and fine motor skills. Motor skills are the ability to move muscles. Gross motor skills involve moving large muscles for movements such as walking and jumping. Fine motor skills are the ability to move small muscles with precision, such as picking up a toy or using a fork.
Common tests include:
Ages and Stages Questionnaire.
This test is designed for children between the ages of 1 month and 5 1/2 years. It contains a series of questions with answer choices of "yes," "sometimes," and "not yet."
Parents' Evaluation of Developmental Status (PEDS).
This test is designed for children from birth to age 8. It is a brief test that can be completed in about five minutes.
Child Development Inventories (CDI).
These are three different tests. They are geared to age groups from infancy to preschool. Each contains 60 yes or no questions.
Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (M-CHAT).
This test is for toddlers between the ages of 16 and 30 months. It includes a series of yes or no questions.
Are there any special preparations needed for this screening?
There are no special preparations needed for this screening.
Are there any risks to the screening?
There is no risk in taking a questionnaire.
What do the results mean?
If the results show that your child is not developing at the same rate as other children of the same age, it doesn't necessarily mean there is a problem. But your child may be referred to specialist for further testing and treatment. If you have questions about the results, talk to your child's provider.
Is there anything else I need to know about developmental and behavioral screening tests?
If screening tests show a problem with your child's development, your child's provider may recommend at-home developmental monitoring. Developmental monitoring is a way to look at how your child grows and changes over time. Parents and other caregivers use brief checklists to track the child's development.
