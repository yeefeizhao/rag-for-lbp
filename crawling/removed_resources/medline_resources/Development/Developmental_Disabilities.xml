Summary
Developmental disabilities are severe, long-term problems. They may be physical, such as
blindness
.  They may affect mental ability, such as
learning disabilities
.  Or the problem can be both physical and mental, such as
Down syndrome
. The problems are usually life-long, and can affect everyday living.
There are many causes of developmental disabilities, including:
Genetic or chromosome abnormalities. These cause conditions such as Down syndrome and
Rett syndrome
.
Prenatal exposure to substances. For example,
drinking alcohol when pregnant
can cause
fetal alcohol spectrum disorders
.
Certain
infections in pregnancy
Preterm birth
Often there is no cure, but treatment can help the symptoms. Treatments include physical, speech, and occupational therapy. Special education classes and psychological counseling can also help.
