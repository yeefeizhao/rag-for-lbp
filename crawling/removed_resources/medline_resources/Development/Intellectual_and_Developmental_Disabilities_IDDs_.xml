<page><title>Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (IDDs)</title><url>https://www.nichd.nih.gov/health/topics/idds</url><content>IDDs are a primary focus of NICHD’s research support. IDDs include disabilities and disorders that affect the nervous system, metabolism, and cell function and survival.
NICHD supports and conducts research to understand the causes and effects of IDDs and to help identify effective therapies for these disorders. NICHD invests heavily in supporting many areas of IDD research, including genetic and developmental causes of IDDs; ways that IDDs affect learning, communication, cognition, and memory; interactions of the family and community with individuals with IDDs; and effect of individual factors on social interactions, behavior, and emotions.
General Information
About IDDs
IDDs are disorders that are usually present at birth and that uniquely affect the trajectory of the individual’s physical, intellectual, and/or emotional development.
More &gt;&gt;
What are the signs of IDDs?
The signs of IDDs vary depending on the condition. A few signs include a delay in motor skills, difficulty remembering things, and challenges solving problems.
More &gt;&gt;
How many people are affected/at risk for IDDs?
The exact number of people affected by IDDs is unknown. This is because IDDs cover a wide range of conditions, many of which are diagnosed several years after birth, rather than in newborns.
More &gt;&gt;
What causes IDDs?
IDDs have a variety of causes. Some possible causes include genetic mutations, chromosome abnormalities, infection during pregnancy, preterm birth, and traumatic brain injury.
More &gt;&gt;
How do healthcare providers diagnose IDDs?
A test of intelligence or cognition is typically used to diagnose an intellectual disability. Clinicians will also observe a child’s behavior for signs of a disability and assess adaptive behavior.
More &gt;&gt;
What should I do if I think my child has an IDD?
Many IDDs have no cure, but there are often ways to treat their symptoms. Your healthcare provider can help you and your child navigate treatment options for IDDs.
More &gt;&gt;
What are treatments for IDDs?
First, speak with your child’s healthcare provider if you suspect your child has an IDD. If the healthcare provider notices signs, then see a developmental pediatrician or another specialist.
