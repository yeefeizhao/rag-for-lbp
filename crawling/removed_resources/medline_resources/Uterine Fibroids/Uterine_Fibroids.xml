Also called: Fibroids, Uterine leiomyomata
Summary
Uterine fibroids are the most common benign tumors in women of childbearing age. Fibroids are made of muscle cells and other tissues that grow in and around the wall of the uterus, or womb. The cause of fibroids is unknown. Risk factors include being African American or being overweight.
Many women with fibroids have no symptoms. If you do have symptoms, they may include:
Heavy or painful periods or bleeding between periods
Feeling "full" in the lower abdomen
Urinating often
Pain during sex
Lower back pain
Reproductive problems, such as infertility, multiple miscarriages or early labor
Your health care provider may find fibroids during a gynecological exam or by using imaging tests.  Treatment includes drugs that can slow or stop their growth, or surgery.  If you have no symptoms, you may not even need treatment. Many women with fibroids can get pregnant naturally. For those who cannot, infertility treatments may help.
