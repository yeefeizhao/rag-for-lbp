Uterine fibroids
are tumors that grow in a woman's womb (uterus). These growths are not cancerous.
No one knows exactly what causes fibroids.
You may have seen your health care provider for uterine fibroids. They can cause:
Heavy menstrual bleeding and long periods
Bleeding between periods
Painful periods
An urge to urinate more often
Feeling fullness or pressure in your lower belly
Pain during intercourse
Many women with fibroids have no symptoms. If you have symptoms, you may receive medicines or sometimes surgery. There are also certain things you can do to help relieve fibroid pain.
Medicines to Treat Uterine Fibroids
Your provider may prescribe different types of hormone therapy to help control extra bleeding. This may include birth control pills or injections. Be sure to follow provider's directions for taking these medicines. Do not stop taking them without talking to your provider first. Be sure to tell your provider about any side effects that you have.
Over-the-counter pain relievers can reduce the pain of uterine fibroids. These include:
Ibuprofen (Advil)
Naproxen (Aleve)
Acetaminophen (Tylenol)
To help ease painful periods, try starting these medicines 1 to 2 days before your period begins.
You may be receiving hormone therapy to prevent the endometriosis from becoming worse. Ask your doctor about side effects, including:
Birth control pills to help with heavy periods.
Intrauterine devices (IUDs) that release hormones to help reduce heavy bleeding and pain.
Medicines that cause a menopause-like state. Side effects include hot flashes, vaginal dryness, and mood changes.
Iron supplements may be prescribed to prevent or treat anemia due to heavy periods. Constipation and diarrhea are very common with these supplements. If constipation becomes a problem, take a stool softener such as docusate sodium (Colace).
Self Care
Learning how to manage your symptoms can make it easier to live with fibroids.
Apply a hot water bottle or heating pad on your lower stomach. This can get blood flowing and relax your muscles. Warm baths also may help relieve pain.
Lie down and rest. Place a pillow under your knees when lying on your back. If you prefer to lie on your side, pull your knees up toward your chest. These positions help take the pressure off your back.
Get regular exercise. Exercise helps improve blood flow. It also triggers your body's natural painkillers, called endorphins.
Eat a balanced, healthy diet. Maintaining a healthy weight will help improve your overall health. Eating plenty of fiber can help keep you regular so you do not have to strain during bowel movements.
Techniques to relax and help relieve pain include:
Muscle relaxation
Deep breathing
Visualization
Biofeedback
Yoga
Some women find that acupuncture helps ease painful periods.
When to Call the Doctor
Call your provider if you have:
Heavy bleeding
Increased cramping
Bleeding between periods
Fullness or heaviness in your lower belly area
If self-care for pain does not help, talk with your provider about other treatment options.
