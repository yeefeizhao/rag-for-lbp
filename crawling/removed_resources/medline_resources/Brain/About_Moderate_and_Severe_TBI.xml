About Moderate and Severe TBI
Key points
Moderate and severe TBIs may lead to long-term or life-long health problems.
Falls and firearm-related injuries lead to most moderate and severe TBIs.
Moderate and severe TBIs are costly.
Overview
A moderate or severe TBI is caused by a bump, blow, or jolt to the head or by a penetrating injury (such as
from a gunshot
) to the head. In the United States, severe TBIs are linked to thousands of deaths each year.
1
For those who survive, a moderate or severe TBI may lead to long-term or life-long health problems that may affect all aspects of a person's life. These health problems have been described as being similar to the effects of a chronic disease.

Causes
Falls and firearm-related injuries lead to most moderate and severe TBIs
Research shows:
Falls
are one of the leading causes of TBI-related hospitalizations among Americans, especially among older adults (age 75 years and older)
3
Firearm-related
suicide
is linked to many TBI-related deaths in the United States
4
5
Motor vehicle crashes
and
assaults
are other common ways a person may get a moderate or severe TBI

Cost of TBIs
Moderate and severe TBIs are costly
A person with a moderate or severe TBI may need ongoing care to help with their recovery.

7
A moderate or severe TBI not only impacts the life of an individual and their family, but it also has a large societal and economic toll. The lifetime economic cost of TBI, including direct and indirect medical costs, was estimated to be approximately $76.5 billion (in 2010 dollars).
8
Additionally, the cost of fatal TBIs and TBIs requiring hospitalization account for approximately 90% of total TBI medical costs.

22% died, 30% became worse, 22% stayed the same, and 26% improved.
*Data are US population estimates based on the TBI Model Systems National Database. Data refer to people 16 years of age and older who received inpatient rehabilitation services for a primary diagnosis of TBI.
