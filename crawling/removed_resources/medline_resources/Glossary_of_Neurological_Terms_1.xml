Hypertonia
Hypertonia is a medical term for too much muscle tone. It can make arms or legs stiff and difficult to move and often happens when part of the brain or spinal cord is damaged.
Hypotonia
Hypotonia is a medical term for decreased muscle tone and can happen when the brain, spinal cord, nerves, or muscles are damaged.
-I-
Immunoglobulins
Immunoglobulins are natural antibodies produced by the immune system.
Inflammation
Inflammation is a condition in which tissues, organs, or other parts of the body become swollen, hot, or painful. Inflammation can be a reaction to an infection or injury. Inflammation in the brain or spinal cord can cause other problems.
Intravenous immunoglobulin
Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) is a common treatment for peripheral neuropathy caused by autoantibodies.
-L-
Learning Disabilities
Learning disabilities are disorders that affect a person’s ability to understand, or use spoken or written language, do mathematical calculations, coordinate movements, or direct attention. Learning disabilities occur in very young children but may not be identified until the child reaches school age. The most common treatment is special education and assistive devices.
Lesion
A lesion is an area of abnormal or damaged tissue found inside or outside of the body. It can be caused by injury, infection, or disease.

This page includes plain language definitions of commonly used medical terms related to the brain.
-A-
Agnosia
Agnosia is the inability to recognize and identify objects or persons using one or more of the senses. It is caused by damage to the brain from strokes, brain injuries, dementia, or other neurological conditions. The inability to recognize something familiar does not necessarily mean that the person has problems with vision or thinking ability.

Anemia is a condition in which a person’s blood does not produce enough healthy red blood cells which provide oxygen to body tissues. This can cause weakness and fatigue.
Aphasia
Aphasia is the loss of ability to speak or understand speech, usually caused by damage to the brain.
Apraxia
Apraxia is the loss of the ability to perform skilled movements and gestures. For example, a person may no longer be able to wink, lick their lips, or complete the steps required to bathe or dress themselves.
Atrophy
Atrophy is the process of wasting away or deteriorating in cells, tissues, and organs.
Atrial Fibrillation
Atrial fibrillation is a rapid, irregular, weak beating of the left atrium or upper chamber of the heart. It can cause blood clots and is a major risk factor for ischemic stroke.
Autonomic Nervous System
The autonomic nervous system is the part of the nervous system that controls involuntary functions such as breathing and heartbeat.
Autosomal Recessive Disorders
Autosomal recessive disorders refers to disorders in which means both parents carry and pass on a copy of a defective gene to the affected person.
Axon
The axon is the part of the neuron that carries signals from the body of the neuron to the axon terminal, where the signal travels to other cells.
-B-
Biomarkers
Biomarker is a term used to refer to biological signs of disease found in blood, body fluids, and tissues. Biomarkers can help indicate risk of a disease, aid in diagnosis, and track progression.
Blood-brain barrier
The blood-brain barrier is a layer of tightly-packed cells that control the movement of substances between the blood and the fluid that surrounds the brain’s neurons. It filters what goes in and out of the brain, allowing water, oxygen, and some medications to reach the brain. The blood-brain barrier also blocks harmful substances like bacteria, viruses, or other toxins before they reach the brain.
-C-
Central Nervous System
The central nervous system is the brain and spinal cord. It controls thinking, movement, and emotion, as well as autonomic functions like heartbeat, breathing, and body temperature.
Cephalocele
Cephalocele is a condition that arises as the brain is developing in which part of the brain and central nervous system protrude outside of the skull.
Cerebral
A term used to describe the principal part of the brain, the cerebrum.
Cerebral Atrophy
Cerebral atrophy includes neurons being injured and dying, connections between networks of neurons breaking down, and the gradual shrinking of brain regions.
Cerebral Hypoxia
Cerebral hypoxia is a condition in which the brain doesn’t get enough oxygen to function normally, even though blood flow is normal.
Cerebrospinal Fluid
Cerebrospinal fluid is a fluid that surrounds and fills the brain and spinal cord. It protects the brain, provides nourishment for cells, and removes waste.
Chorea
Chorea is a movement disorder that causes sudden, unintended, and uncontrollable jerky movements of the muscles in the face, arms, or legs. It is a symptom of many conditions and diseases and is caused by overactivity of the chemical dopamine in the brain.
Clonus
Clonus is a reflex response that includes involuntary and rhythmic muscle contractions. It is seen in some neurological conditions.
Contracture
A contracture describes a shortening or tightening of the muscles or tendons around a person's joints. It usually results in a decreased range of motion in the joint.
