Cancer stage and grade are important factors in deciding the best treatment for bladder cancer. Other factors, such as your preferences and overall health, are also important.
For some people, taking part in a clinical trial may be an option. Clinical trials of new cancer drugs or treatment combinations may be available. To learn more about clinical trials, including how to find and join      a trial, see
Clinical Trials Information for Patients and Caregivers
.
Treatment of stage 0 bladder cancer
The main treatment for
stage 0 bladder cancer
(noninvasive papillary carcinoma and carcinoma in situ) is a surgery called
transurethral resection
(TUR) with
fulguration
.
Because stage 0 bladder cancer often comes back after surgery, most people also receive
intravesical chemotherapy
with
mitomycin
or
gemcitabine
at the time of surgery. Some may go on to receive a series of treatments with either intravesical
BCG
or intravesical chemotherapy.
Some people with stage 0 bladder cancer—those with many tumors or who have carcinoma in situ, a high-grade form of the disease—may have partial or complete cystectomy (surgical removal of the bladder). People with carcinoma in situ who cannot or choose not to have a cystectomy and for whom BCG did not work may receive the immunotherapy drug
pembrolizumab
.
For more information about these treatments, see
Bladder Cancer Treatment
.
Treatment of stage I bladder cancer
The main treatment for
stage I bladder cancer
is a surgery called
transurethral resection
(TUR) with
fulguration
. Most people also receive
intravesical
chemotherapy
with
mitomycin
or
gemcitabine
at the time of surgery. Some may go on to receive a series of treatments with either intravesical
BCG
or intravesical chemotherapy.
People with stage I bladder cancer that has recurred (come back) after intravesical therapy may receive partial or complete cystectomy (surgical removal of the bladder).
For information about these treatments, see
Bladder Cancer Treatment
.
Treatment of stages II and III bladder cancer
The two main treatments for
stage II bladder cancer
and
stage III bladder cancer
are radical cystectomy or a combination of
radiation therapy
and
chemotherapy
.
Radical cystectomy is surgery to remove the bladder and surrounding tissues and organs. Surgery to make a new way for urine to leave the body (called urinary diversion) will be done. Additional treatments may be given before or after surgery:
Chemotherapy may be given before surgery to people who are well enough to tolerate it. Giving combination chemotherapy that includes
cisplatin
before surgery has been shown to help people live longer than surgery alone.
The
immunotherapy
drug
nivolumab
may be given if the cancer has a high risk of coming back after surgery or did not respond to chemotherapy.
People who are unable or choose not to have surgery will receive a combination of radiation therapy  and chemotherapy, such as cisplatin and
fluorouracil
, given at the same time. Giving chemotherapy at the same time as radiation therapy helps the radiation therapy work better.
Partial cystectomy (removal of part of the bladder) is a less common treatment for stages II and III bladder cancer.
To learn more about these treatments, see
Bladder Cancer Treatment
.
Treatment of stage IV bladder cancer
Treatment of
stage IVA bladder cancer
may include
systemic chemotherapy
, such as one of the following regimens, given alone:
methotrexate
,
vinblastine
,
doxorubicin
, and
cisplatin
(MVAC)
high-dose MVAC
cisplatin, methotrexate, and vinblastine
a cisplatin-based chemotherapy regimen  followed by surgery to remove the bladder and surrounding tissues and organs (radical cystectomy) and
urinary diversion
or surgery alone
radiation therapy
and chemotherapy, such as cisplatin and
fluorouracil
, given at the same time, to help the radiation therapy work better
urinary diversion, as palliative therapy  or to prevent a blockage of urine that could cause kidney damage
surgery to remove part or all of the bladder (cystectomy) as palliative therapy
Treatment of
stage IVB bladder cancer
may include
systemic  chemotherapy, such as one of the   following regimens:
gemcitabine
with either cisplatin or
carboplatin
methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin (MVAC)
high-dose MVAC
cisplatin, methotrexate, and vinblastine (CMV)
an
immunotherapy
drug, such as
avelumab
,
nivolumab
, or
pembrolizumab
radiation therapy as palliative therapy
urinary diversion, as palliative therapy or to prevent a blockage of urine that could damage the kidneys
surgery to remove part or all of the bladder (cystectomy) as palliative therapy
Palliative therapy is treatment meant to relieve symptoms and improve the quality of life of people who have a serious or life-threatening disease, such as cancer. Many of the same treatments for cancer, such as surgery and radiation therapy, can also be used for palliative therapy to help a person feel more comfortable. Learn more about
Palliative Care in Cancer
.

Bladder Cancer Treatment
.
Treatment of recurrent bladder cancer
Treatment of bladder cancer that has recurred (come back) depends on previous treatment and where the cancer has come back. Treatment may include
systemic  chemotherapy
, such one of the following regimens, given alone:
gemcitabine
with either
cisplatin
or
carboplatin
methotrexate
,
vinblastine
,
doxorubicin
, and cisplatin (MVAC)
high-dose MVAC
cisplatin, methotrexate, and vinblastine
an
immunotherapy
drug, such as
avelumab
,
nivolumab
, or
pembrolizumab
a
targeted therapy
drug, such as
enfortumab vedotin
,
erdafitinib
, or
ramucirumab
surgery for non-muscle-invasive or
localized
tumors, which may be followed by immunotherapy and chemotherapy
radiation therapy
as palliative therapy
Palliative therapy is treatment meant to relieve symptoms and improve the quality of life of people who have a serious or life-threatening disease, such as cancer.
