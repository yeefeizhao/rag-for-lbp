            <sectionTitle>Causes</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>Cancer can grow in the urine collection system, but it is uncommon. Renal pelvis and ureter cancers affect men more often than women. These cancers are more common in people older than 65.
The exact causes of this cancer are not known. Long-term (chronic) irritation of the kidney from harmful substances removed in the urine may be a factor. This irritation may be caused by:
Kidney damage from medicines, especially ones for pain (analgesic nephropathy)Exposure to certain dyes and chemicals used to manufacture leather goods, textiles, plastics, and rubberSmoking 
People who have had bladder cancer are also at risk.</sectionContent>

            <sectionTitle>Symptoms</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>Symptoms may include any of the following:

            <sectionTitle>Exams and Tests</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>The health care provider will perform a physical exam, and examine your belly area (abdomen). In rare cases, this may reveal an enlarged kidney.
If tests are done:
Urinalysis may show blood in the urine.A complete blood count (CBC) may show anemia.Urine cytology (microscopic examination of cells) may reveal cancer cells. 
Other tests that may be ordered include:
Abdominal CT scanChest x-rayCystoscopy with ureteroscopyIntravenous pyelogram (IVP)Kidney ultrasoundMRI of the abdomenRenal scan
These tests may reveal a tumor or show that the cancer has spread from the kidneys.</sectionContent>

            <sectionTitle>Treatment</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>The goal of treatment is to eliminate the cancer.
The following procedures may be used to treat the condition:
Nephroureterectomy -- This involves removal of entire kidney, ureter, and the bladder cuff (tissue that connects ureter to the bladder)Nephrectomy -- Surgery to remove all or part of the kidney is often done. This may include removing part of the bladder and tissues around it, or the lymph nodes.Ureter resection -- Surgery to remove part of the ureter that contains cancer, and some healthy tissue around it. This may be used in case of superficial tumors present in lower part of the ureter near the bladder. This may help to preserve the kidney.Chemotherapy -- This is used when the cancer has spread outside of the kidney or ureter. Because these tumors are similar to a form of bladder cancer, they are treated with a similar type of chemotherapy.Immunotherapy -- This is used when the cancer has spread outside of the kidney or ureter. Because these tumors are similar to a form of bladder cancer, they are treated with a similar type of immunotherapy.</sectionContent>

            <sectionTitle>Outlook (Prognosis)</sectionTitle>
            <sectionContent>Outcome varies, depending on the location of the tumor and whether the cancer has spread. Cancer that is only in the kidney or ureter may be cured with surgery.
Cancer that has spread to other organs is usually not curable.</sectionContent>
