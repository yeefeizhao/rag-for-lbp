If you’ve recently been diagnosed with prostate cancer, you may be asking yourself if there were warning signs or symptoms you should have noticed earlier.
So what are the warning signs of prostate cancer?
Unfortunately, there usually aren’t any early warning signs for prostate cancer. The growing tumor does not push against anything to cause pain, so for many years the disease may be silent. That’s why
screening
for prostate cancer is such an important topic for all men and their families.

In rare cases, prostate cancer can cause symptoms. Contact your doctor for an evaluation if you experience any of the following:
A need to urinate frequently, especially at night, some- times urgently
Difficulty starting or holding back urination
Weak, dribbling, or interrupted flow of urine
Painful or burning urination
Difficulty in having an erection
A decrease in the amount of fluid ejaculated
Painful ejaculation
Blood in the urine or semen
Pressure or pain in the rectum
Pain or stiffness in the lower back, hips, pelvis, or thighs
Remember: urinary symptoms don’t necessarily mean you have cancer.
Prostatitis
or
BPH
(Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia, also known as enlargement of the prostate) are benign diseases but can cause similar symptoms and are very common.
What about difficulty in having an erection? Again, this is most likely not caused by cancer but by other factors such as diabetes, smoking, cardiovascular disease, or just plain getting older.
That said: Symptoms are symptoms, and no matter what’s most likely to be causing them, you should get them checked out by a doctor.
