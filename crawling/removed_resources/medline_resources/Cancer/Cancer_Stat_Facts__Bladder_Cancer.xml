Rate of New Cases and Deaths per 100,000:
The rate of new cases of bladder cancer was 18.2 per 100,000 men and women per year. The death rate was 4.1 per 100,000 men and women per year. These rates are age-adjusted and based on 2017–2021 cases and 2018–2022 deaths.
Lifetime Risk of Developing Cancer
: Approximately 2.2 percent of men and women will be diagnosed with bladder cancer at some point during their lifetime, based on 2018–2021 data, excluding 2020 due to COVID.
Prevalence of This Cancer
: In 2021, there were an estimated 730,044 people living with bladder cancer in the United States.

Survival Statistics
How Many People Survive 5 Years Or More after Being Diagnosed with Bladder Cancer?
Relative survival is an estimate of the percentage of patients who would be expected to survive the effects of their cancer. It excludes the risk of dying from other causes. Because survival statistics are based on large groups of people, they cannot be used to predict exactly what will happen to an individual patient. No two patients are entirely alike, and treatment and responses to treatment can vary greatly.
5-Year
Relative Survival
78.4%
Based on data from SEER 22 (Excluding IL/MA) 2014–2020. Gray figures represent those who have died from bladder cancer. Green figures represent those who have survived 5 years or more.

Survival by Stage
Cancer stage at diagnosis, which refers to extent of a cancer in the body, determines treatment options and has a strong influence on the length of survival. In general, if the cancer is found only in the part of the body where it started it is
localized
(sometimes referred to as stage 1). If it has spread to a different part of the body, the stage is
regional
or
distant
. The earlier bladder cancer is caught, the better chance a person has of surviving five years after being diagnosed. For bladder cancer, 33.9% are diagnosed at the local stage. The 5-year relative survival for localized bladder cancer is 71.7%.

Changes Over Time
Keeping track of new cases, deaths, and survival over time (trends) can help scientists understand whether progress is being made and where additional research is needed to address challenges, such as improving screening or finding better treatments.
Using statistical models for analysis, age-adjusted rates for new bladder cancer cases have been falling on average 1.0% each year over 2012–2021. Age-adjusted death rates have been falling on average 0.9% each year over 2013–2022. 5-year relative survival trends are shown below.

Figure: Anatomy of the male urinary system (left)

Figure: Anatomy of the male urinary system (left) and female urinary system (right) showing the kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra.
The bladder is a hollow organ in the lower part of the abdomen. It is shaped like a small balloon and has a muscular wall that allows it to get larger or smaller. The urine passes from the two kidneys into the bladder through two tubes called
ureters
. The bladder is emptied through another tube called the urethra.
There are three types of bladder cancer that begin in cells in the lining of the bladder:
transitional cell carcinoma
:;
squamous cell carcinoma
; and
adenocarcinoma
.
Cancer that is confined to the lining of the bladder is called superficial bladder cancer. Cancer that begins in the transitional cells may spread through the lining of the bladder and invade the muscle wall of the bladder or spread to nearby organs and lymph nodes; this is called invasive bladder cancer.

Rate of New Cases and Deaths per 100,000:
The rate of new cases of bladder cancer was 18.2 per 100,000 men and women per year. The death rate was 4.1 per 100,000 men and women per year. These rates are age-adjusted and based on 2017–2021 cases and 2018–2022 deaths.
Lifetime Risk of Developing Cancer
: Approximately 2.2 percent of men and women will be diagnosed with bladder cancer at some point during their lifetime, based on 2018–2021 data, excluding 2020 due to COVID.
Prevalence of This Cancer
: In 2021, there were an estimated 730,044 people living with bladder cancer in the United States.

Survival Statistics
How Many People Survive 5 Years Or More after Being Diagnosed with Bladder Cancer?
Relative survival is an estimate of the percentage of patients who would be expected to survive the effects of their cancer. It excludes the risk of dying from other causes. Because survival statistics are based on large groups of people, they cannot be used to predict exactly what will happen to an individual patient. No two patients are entirely alike, and treatment and responses to treatment can vary greatly.
5-Year
Relative Survival
78.4%
Based on data from SEER 22 (Excluding IL/MA) 2014–2020. Gray figures represent those who have died from bladder cancer. Green figures represent those who have survived 5 years or more.

Survival by Stage
Cancer stage at diagnosis, which refers to extent of a cancer in the body, determines treatment options and has a strong influence on the length of survival. In general, if the cancer is found only in the part of the body where it started it is
localized
(sometimes referred to as stage 1). If it has spread to a different part of the body, the stage is
regional
or
distant
. The earlier bladder cancer is caught, the better chance a person has of surviving five years after being diagnosed. For bladder cancer, 33.9% are diagnosed at the local stage. The 5-year relative survival for localized bladder cancer is 71.7%.

Changes Over Time
Keeping track of new cases, deaths, and survival over time (trends) can help scientists understand whether progress is being made and where additional research is needed to address challenges, such as improving screening or finding better treatments.
Using statistical models for analysis, age-adjusted rates for new bladder cancer cases have been falling on average 1.0% each year over 2012–2021. Age-adjusted death rates have been falling on average 0.9% each year over 2013–2022. 5-year relative survival trends are shown below.

Figure: Anatomy of the male urinary system (left) and female urinary system (right) showing the kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra.
The bladder is a hollow organ in the lower part of the abdomen. It is shaped like a small balloon and has a muscular wall that allows it to get larger or smaller. The urine passes from the two kidneys into the bladder through two tubes called
ureters
. The bladder is emptied through another tube called the urethra.
There are three types of bladder cancer that begin in cells in the lining of the bladder:
transitional cell carcinoma
:;
squamous cell carcinoma
; and
adenocarcinoma
.
Cancer that is confined to the lining of the bladder is called superficial bladder cancer. Cancer that begins in the transitional cells may spread through the lining of the bladder and invade the muscle wall of the bladder or spread to nearby organs and lymph nodes; this is called invasive bladder cancer.
