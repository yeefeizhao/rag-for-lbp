What is prevention?
Go to Health Professional Version
Cancer
prevention
is action taken to lower the chance of getting 
         cancer. By preventing cancer, the number of new cases of cancer 
         in a group or population is lowered. Hopefully, this will lower 
         the number of deaths caused by cancer.
To prevent new cancers from starting,
scientists
look at
risk 
         factors
and
protective factors
. Anything that increases your 
         chance of developing cancer is called a cancer risk factor; 
         anything that decreases your chance of developing cancer is 
         called a cancer protective factor.
Some risk factors for cancer can be avoided, but many cannot. 
         For example, both smoking and inheriting certain
genes
are 
         risk factors for some types of cancer, but only smoking can be 
         avoided. Regular exercise and a healthy
diet
may be protective 
         factors for some types of cancer. Avoiding risk factors and 
         increasing protective factors may lower your risk but it does 
         not mean that you will not get cancer.
Different ways to prevent cancer are being studied.
General Information About Prostate Cancer
Key Points
Prostate cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells
		  form in the tissues of the prostate.
Prostate cancer is the second most common  cancer among men in
		  the United States.
Prostate cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells
		  form in the tissues of the prostate.
The
prostate
is a
gland
in the male
reproductive system
. The prostate is just
		  below the
bladder
(the
organ
that
		  collects and empties
urine
) and in
		  front of the
rectum
(the lower part
		  of the
intestine
). It is about the
		  size of a walnut and surrounds part of the
urethra
(the tube that empties urine from the
		  bladder). The prostate gland produces
fluid
that makes up part of the
semen
.

As men age, the prostate may get bigger. A bigger prostate may block the flow of urine from the bladder and cause problems with sexual function. This
condition
is called
benign prostatic hyperplasia
(BPH). BPH is not
cancer
, but
surgery
may be
		  needed to correct it. The
symptoms
of BPH or of other problems in the prostate may be
		  like symptoms of
prostate cancer
.
Enlarge
Normal prostate and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). A normal prostate does not block the flow of urine from the bladder. An enlarged prostate  presses on the bladder and urethra and blocks the flow of urine.
Prostate cancer is the second most common  cancer among men in
		  the United States.
Prostate cancer is most common in older men. In the United States, about one  out of every eight men will be
diagnosed
with prostate cancer.   Most men diagnosed with  prostate cancer do not die of it.
See the following
PDQ
summaries for more information about prostate cancer:
Prostate Cancer Screening
Prostate Cancer Treatment
Prostate Cancer Prevention
Key Points
Avoiding risk factors and increasing protective factors may
		  help prevent  cancer.
The following
risk
factors may increase 
         the risk of prostate cancer:
Age
Family history of prostate cancer
Race
Hormones
Vitamin E
Folic acid
Dairy and calcium
The following
protective
factors may 
         decrease the risk of prostate  cancer:
Folate
Finasteride and dutasteride
The following have been proven not to affect the risk of prostate cancer, or 
     their effects on prostate cancer risk are not known:
Selenium and vitamin E
Diet
Multivitamins
Lycopene
Cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways 
    to prevent cancer.
New ways to prevent prostate cancer are being studied in clinical 
     trials.
Avoiding risk factors and increasing protective factors may
		  help prevent  cancer.
Avoiding
cancer
risk factors
may help
prevent
certain cancers. Risk factors include smoking, having
overweight
, and not getting enough exercise.  Increasing
protective factors
such as quitting smoking and exercising may also help prevent some cancers. Talk to your doctor or other health care professional about how you might lower your risk of cancer.
The following
risk
factors may increase 
         the risk of prostate cancer:
Age
Prostate cancer
is rare in men younger than 50 years of age.
			 The chance of developing prostate cancer increases as men get older.
Family history of prostate cancer
A man whose father, brother, or son has had prostate cancer has a
			 higher-than-average risk of  prostate cancer.
Race
Prostate cancer occurs more often in African American men than in White men. African American men with prostate cancer are more likely to die from the disease than White men with prostate cancer.
Hormones
The
prostate
needs male
hormones
to work the way it should. The main
			 male sex hormone is
testosterone
.  Testosterone helps the body develop and maintain male sex characteristics.
Testosterone is changed into
dihydrotestosterone
(DHT) by an
enzyme
in the
			 body. DHT is important for normal prostate growth but can also cause the
			 prostate to get bigger and may play a part in the development of prostate
cancer
.
Vitamin E
The
Selenium
and
Vitamin E
Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT) found that vitamin E taken alone increased the risk of prostate cancer. The risk continued even after the men stopped taking vitamin E.
Folic acid
Folate is a kind of
vitamin
B that occurs naturally in some foods, such as green vegetables, beans, and orange juice. Folic acid is a man-made form of folate that is found in vitamin
supplements
and
fortified foods
, such as whole-grain breads and cereals. A 10-year study  showed that the risk of prostate cancer was increased in men who took  1
milligram
(mg) supplements of folic acid.      However, the risk of prostate cancer was lower in men who had enough folate in their
diets
.
Dairy and calcium
A diet high in dairy foods and
calcium
may cause a small increase in the risk of  prostate cancer.
The following
protective
factors may 
         decrease the risk of prostate  cancer:
Folate
Folate is a kind of vitamin B that occurs naturally in some foods, such as green vegetables, beans, and orange juice. Folic acid is a man-made form of folate that is found in vitamin supplements and fortified foods, such as whole-grain breads and cereals. A 10-year study showed that the risk of prostate cancer   was lower in men who had enough folate  in their diets. However, the risk of prostate cancer was increased in men who took 1 milligram (mg) supplements of folic acid.
Finasteride and dutasteride
Finasteride
and
dutasteride
are
drugs
used to lower the amount of male sex hormones made by the body. These drugs block the
enzyme
that changes testosterone into
dihydrotestosterone
(DHT). Higher than normal levels of DHT may play a part in developing prostate cancer. Taking finasteride or dutasteride has been shown to  lower the risk  for  prostate cancer, but it is not known  if  these drugs lower the risk of death from prostate cancer.
The Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) studied
				  whether the drug finasteride can prevent prostate cancer in healthy men 55
				  years of age and older. This
prevention
study showed there were fewer prostate cancers in the group of men    that took finasteride compared with the group of men that did not. The number of deaths from prostate cancer was  the same in both groups. Men who took finasteride reported more
side effects
compared with the group of men that did not, including
erectile dysfunction
, loss of desire for sex, and enlarged
breasts
. In the PCPT, the men who took finasteride who did have prostate cancer had more
aggressive
tumors
, but a follow-up analysis of the PCPT found that these men did not have more aggressive tumors.
The Reduction by Dutasteride of Prostate Cancer Events Trial (REDUCE) studied whether the drug dutasteride can prevent prostate cancer in men aged 50 to 75 years at higher risk for the disease. This prevention study showed there were fewer prostate cancers in the group of men who took dutasteride compared with the group of men that did not. The number of less aggressive prostate cancers was lower, but the number of more aggressive prostate cancers was not. Men who took dutasteride reported more side effects than men who did not, including erectile dysfunction, loss of desire for sex, less
semen
, and enlarged breasts.
The following have been proven not to affect the risk of prostate cancer, or 
     their effects on prostate cancer risk are not known:
Selenium and vitamin E
The Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT)
				  studied whether taking vitamin E and selenium (a
mineral
) will prevent prostate cancer. The selenium and vitamin E were taken separately or together by healthy men 55 years of age and older
				  (50 years of age and older for African American men). The study showed  that taking selenium alone or selenium  and vitamin E together did not decrease the risk of prostate cancer.
Diet
It is not known if  decreasing fat or  increasing fruits and vegetables in the diet helps decrease the risk of prostate cancer  or death from prostate cancer. In the PCPT trial, certain
fatty acids
increased the risk of
high-grade
prostate cancer while others  decreased the risk of high-grade prostate cancer.
Multivitamins
Regular use of multivitamins  has not been proven to increase the risk of early or
localized
prostate cancer.  However, a large study showed an  increased risk of
advanced
prostate cancer among men who took multivitamins more than seven times a week.
Lycopene
Some studies have shown that a diet high in
lycopene
may be linked to a decreased risk of prostate cancer, but other studies have not. It has not been proven that taking lycopene supplements decreases the risk of prostate cancer.
Cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways 
    to prevent cancer.
Cancer prevention
clinical trials
are used to study ways to 
         lower the risk of developing certain types of cancer. Some 
         cancer prevention trials are conducted with healthy people who 
         have not had cancer but who have an increased risk for cancer. 
         Other prevention trials are conducted with people who have had 
         cancer and are trying to prevent another cancer of the same type 
         or to lower their chance of developing a new type of cancer. 
         Other trials are done with healthy volunteers who are not known 
         to have any
risk factors
for cancer.
The purpose of some cancer prevention clinical trials is to 
         find out whether actions people take can prevent cancer. These 
         may include eating fruits and vegetables, exercising, quitting 
         smoking, or taking certain
medicines
, vitamins,
minerals
, or 
         food supplements.
New ways to prevent prostate cancer are being studied in clinical 
     trials.

Prostate Cancer Prevention (PDQ®)–Patient Version
What is prevention?
Go to Health Professional Version
Cancer
prevention
is action taken to lower the chance of getting 
         cancer. By preventing cancer, the number of new cases of cancer 
         in a group or population is lowered. Hopefully, this will lower 
         the number of deaths caused by cancer.
To prevent new cancers from starting,
scientists
look at
risk 
         factors
and
protective factors
. Anything that increases your 
         chance of developing cancer is called a cancer risk factor; 
         anything that decreases your chance of developing cancer is 
         called a cancer protective factor.
Some risk factors for cancer can be avoided, but many cannot. 
         For example, both smoking and inheriting certain
genes
are 
         risk factors for some types of cancer, but only smoking can be 
         avoided. Regular exercise and a healthy
diet
may be protective 
         factors for some types of cancer. Avoiding risk factors and 
         increasing protective factors may lower your risk but it does 
         not mean that you will not get cancer.
Different ways to prevent cancer are being studied.
General Information About Prostate Cancer
Key Points
Prostate cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells
		  form in the tissues of the prostate.
Prostate cancer is the second most common  cancer among men in
		  the United States.
Prostate cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells
		  form in the tissues of the prostate.
The
prostate
is a
gland
in the male
reproductive system
. The prostate is just
		  below the
bladder
(the
organ
that
		  collects and empties
urine
) and in
		  front of the
rectum
(the lower part
		  of the
intestine
). It is about the
		  size of a walnut and surrounds part of the
urethra
(the tube that empties urine from the
		  bladder). The prostate gland produces
fluid
that makes up part of the
semen
.

As men age, the prostate may get bigger. A bigger prostate may block the flow of urine from the bladder and cause problems with sexual function. This
condition
is called
benign prostatic hyperplasia
(BPH). BPH is not
cancer
, but
surgery
may be
		  needed to correct it. The
symptoms
of BPH or of other problems in the prostate may be
		  like symptoms of
prostate cancer
.
Enlarge
Normal prostate and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). A normal prostate does not block the flow of urine from the bladder. An enlarged prostate  presses on the bladder and urethra and blocks the flow of urine.
Prostate cancer is the second most common  cancer among men in
		  the United States.
Prostate cancer is most common in older men. In the United States, about one  out of every eight men will be
diagnosed
with prostate cancer.   Most men diagnosed with  prostate cancer do not die of it.

Prostate Cancer Prevention
Key Points
Avoiding risk factors and increasing protective factors may
		  help prevent  cancer.
The following
risk
factors may increase 
         the risk of prostate cancer:
Age
Family history of prostate cancer
Race
Hormones
Vitamin E
Folic acid
Dairy and calcium
The following
protective
factors may 
         decrease the risk of prostate  cancer:
Folate
Finasteride and dutasteride
The following have been proven not to affect the risk of prostate cancer, or 
     their effects on prostate cancer risk are not known:
Selenium and vitamin E
Diet
Multivitamins
Lycopene
Cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways 
    to prevent cancer.
New ways to prevent prostate cancer are being studied in clinical 
     trials.
Avoiding risk factors and increasing protective factors may
		  help prevent  cancer.
Avoiding
cancer
risk factors
may help
prevent
certain cancers. Risk factors include smoking, having
overweight
, and not getting enough exercise.  Increasing
protective factors
such as quitting smoking and exercising may also help prevent some cancers. Talk to your doctor or other health care professional about how you might lower your risk of cancer.
The following
risk
factors may increase 
         the risk of prostate cancer:
Age
Prostate cancer
is rare in men younger than 50 years of age.
			 The chance of developing prostate cancer increases as men get older.
Family history of prostate cancer
A man whose father, brother, or son has had prostate cancer has a
			 higher-than-average risk of  prostate cancer.
Race
Prostate cancer occurs more often in African American men than in White men. African American men with prostate cancer are more likely to die from the disease than White men with prostate cancer.
Hormones
The
prostate
needs male
hormones
to work the way it should. The main
			 male sex hormone is
testosterone
.  Testosterone helps the body develop and maintain male sex characteristics.
Testosterone is changed into
dihydrotestosterone
(DHT) by an
enzyme
in the
			 body. DHT is important for normal prostate growth but can also cause the
			 prostate to get bigger and may play a part in the development of prostate
cancer
.
Vitamin E
The
Selenium
and
Vitamin E
Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT) found that vitamin E taken alone increased the risk of prostate cancer. The risk continued even after the men stopped taking vitamin E.
Folic acid
Folate is a kind of
vitamin
B that occurs naturally in some foods, such as green vegetables, beans, and orange juice. Folic acid is a man-made form of folate that is found in vitamin
supplements
and
fortified foods
, such as whole-grain breads and cereals. A 10-year study  showed that the risk of prostate cancer was increased in men who took  1
milligram
(mg) supplements of folic acid.      However, the risk of prostate cancer was lower in men who had enough folate in their
diets
.
Dairy and calcium
A diet high in dairy foods and
calcium
may cause a small increase in the risk of  prostate cancer.
The following
protective
factors may 
         decrease the risk of prostate  cancer:
Folate
Folate is a kind of vitamin B that occurs naturally in some foods, such as green vegetables, beans, and orange juice. Folic acid is a man-made form of folate that is found in vitamin supplements and fortified foods, such as whole-grain breads and cereals. A 10-year study showed that the risk of prostate cancer   was lower in men who had enough folate  in their diets. However, the risk of prostate cancer was increased in men who took 1 milligram (mg) supplements of folic acid.
Finasteride and dutasteride
Finasteride
and
dutasteride
are
drugs
used to lower the amount of male sex hormones made by the body. These drugs block the
enzyme
that changes testosterone into
dihydrotestosterone
(DHT). Higher than normal levels of DHT may play a part in developing prostate cancer. Taking finasteride or dutasteride has been shown to  lower the risk  for  prostate cancer, but it is not known  if  these drugs lower the risk of death from prostate cancer.
The Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) studied
				  whether the drug finasteride can prevent prostate cancer in healthy men 55
				  years of age and older. This
prevention
study showed there were fewer prostate cancers in the group of men    that took finasteride compared with the group of men that did not. The number of deaths from prostate cancer was  the same in both groups. Men who took finasteride reported more
side effects
compared with the group of men that did not, including
erectile dysfunction
, loss of desire for sex, and enlarged
breasts
. In the PCPT, the men who took finasteride who did have prostate cancer had more
aggressive
tumors
, but a follow-up analysis of the PCPT found that these men did not have more aggressive tumors.
The Reduction by Dutasteride of Prostate Cancer Events Trial (REDUCE) studied whether the drug dutasteride can prevent prostate cancer in men aged 50 to 75 years at higher risk for the disease. This prevention study showed there were fewer prostate cancers in the group of men who took dutasteride compared with the group of men that did not. The number of less aggressive prostate cancers was lower, but the number of more aggressive prostate cancers was not. Men who took dutasteride reported more side effects than men who did not, including erectile dysfunction, loss of desire for sex, less
semen
, and enlarged breasts.
The following have been proven not to affect the risk of prostate cancer, or 
     their effects on prostate cancer risk are not known:
Selenium and vitamin E
The Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT)
				  studied whether taking vitamin E and selenium (a
mineral
) will prevent prostate cancer. The selenium and vitamin E were taken separately or together by healthy men 55 years of age and older
				  (50 years of age and older for African American men). The study showed  that taking selenium alone or selenium  and vitamin E together did not decrease the risk of prostate cancer.
Diet
It is not known if  decreasing fat or  increasing fruits and vegetables in the diet helps decrease the risk of prostate cancer  or death from prostate cancer. In the PCPT trial, certain
fatty acids
increased the risk of
high-grade
prostate cancer while others  decreased the risk of high-grade prostate cancer.
Multivitamins
Regular use of multivitamins  has not been proven to increase the risk of early or
localized
prostate cancer.  However, a large study showed an  increased risk of
advanced
prostate cancer among men who took multivitamins more than seven times a week.
Lycopene
Some studies have shown that a diet high in
lycopene
may be linked to a decreased risk of prostate cancer, but other studies have not. It has not been proven that taking lycopene supplements decreases the risk of prostate cancer.
Cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways 
    to prevent cancer.
Cancer prevention
clinical trials
are used to study ways to 
         lower the risk of developing certain types of cancer. Some 
         cancer prevention trials are conducted with healthy people who 
         have not had cancer but who have an increased risk for cancer. 
         Other prevention trials are conducted with people who have had 
         cancer and are trying to prevent another cancer of the same type 
         or to lower their chance of developing a new type of cancer. 
         Other trials are done with healthy volunteers who are not known 
         to have any
risk factors
for cancer.
The purpose of some cancer prevention clinical trials is to 
         find out whether actions people take can prevent cancer. These 
         may include eating fruits and vegetables, exercising, quitting 
         smoking, or taking certain
medicines
, vitamins,
minerals
, or 
         food supplements.
New ways to prevent prostate cancer are being studied in clinical 
     trials.

About This PDQ Summary
About PDQ
Physician Data Query (PDQ) is the National Cancer Institute's (NCI's) comprehensive cancer information database. The PDQ database contains summaries of the latest published information on cancer prevention, detection, genetics, treatment, supportive care, and complementary and alternative medicine. Most summaries come in two versions. The health professional versions have detailed information written in technical language. The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language. Both versions have cancer information that is accurate and up to date and most versions are also available in
Spanish
.
PDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal government’s center of biomedical research.  The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH.
Purpose of This Summary
This PDQ cancer information summary has current information about prostate cancer prevention.  It is meant to inform and help patients, families, and caregivers. It does not give formal guidelines or recommendations for making decisions about health care.
Reviewers and Updates
Editorial Boards write the PDQ cancer information summaries and keep them up to date. These Boards are made up of experts in cancer treatment and other specialties related to cancer. The summaries are reviewed regularly and changes are made when there is new information. The date on each summary ("Updated") is the date of the most recent change.
The information in this patient summary was taken from the health professional version, which is reviewed regularly and updated as needed, by the
PDQ Screening and Prevention Editorial Board
.
Clinical Trial Information
A clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become "standard." Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
Clinical trials can be found online at
NCI's website
. For more information, call the
Cancer Information Service
(CIS), NCI's contact center, at 1-800-4-CANCER (1-800-422-6237).
