NCI-funded researchers are working to improve our understanding of how to treat bladder cancer. With recent advances in
immunotherapy
and
targeted therapy
, treatment has the potential to become more effective and less toxic.
This page highlights some of the latest research in bladder cancer, including clinical advances that may soon translate into improved care and research findings from recent studies.
New Bladder Cancer Treatments
Bladder cancer treatments are based on the type of bladder cancer and the
stage
of the disease. The most common type of bladder cancer is
transitional cell
carcinoma
, also called
urothelial
carcinoma
, which begins in cells in the innermost tissue layer of the bladder. There are other types of bladder cancers such as
squamous cell carcinoma
,
small cell carcinoma
, and
adenocarcinoma
, among others.
The mainstays of bladder cancer treatment are
surgery
,
radiation therapy
,
chemotherapy
, and
immunotherapy
, depending on the stage. Scientists continue to study novel treatments and drugs, along with new combinations of existing treatments.
Chemotherapy Combo Effective for Common Bladder Cancer
Gemcitabine and docetaxel combo proves a good alternative to BCG for high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer.
Non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer is cancer that has grown through the lining of the bladder but hasn’t yet invaded the muscle layer of the bladder. Treatment for this cancer is usually to remove the tumor by scraping it from the bladder wall.
Some patients may receive additional treatment after surgery with an immune-based therapy called
bacillus Calmette-Guérin
(BCG), or with chemotherapy drugs such as
mitomycin C (Jelmyto)
or
gemcitabine
put directly into the bladder
to reduce the risk that the cancer will recur.
Immunotherapy
Immunotherapy
is treatment that helps the body’s immune system fight cancer more effectively. Certain immunotherapy drugs, called
immune checkpoint inhibitor
s, are approved to treat some patients with
locally advanced
or
metastatic
bladder cancer.
Patients whose bladder cancers respond to immune checkpoint inhibitors tend to maintain those responses for long periods. Ongoing clinical trials will help researchers learn whether these extended responses help patients live longer.
However, only a small number of patients respond to immune checkpoint inhibitors. Scientists are trying to develop
biomarker
s that could help doctors identify which patients with bladder cancer are likely to respond to these drugs. For example, a checkpoint protein called
PD-L1
has been studied as a biomarker for response to treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors.
Scientists have now begun to test immune checkpoint inhibitors in earlier stages of bladder cancer and in combination with other treatments, such as chemotherapy:
The NCI-sponsored
AMBASSADOR trial
is comparing the immune checkpoint inhibitor
pembrolizumab (Keytruda)
with observation. This is being done in patients with bladder cancer that invades the muscle layer of the bladder wall (localized muscle-invasive disease) or that has spread to nearby lymph nodes (locally advanced disease) and has been surgically removed. The trial will see if pembrolizumab improves
overall survival
or
disease-free survival
.
In 2021, the
Food and Drug Administration
(FDA)
approved the immune checkpoint inhibitor nivolumab (Opdivo) as an additional (adjuvant) treatment of patients with urothelial carcinoma who are at high risk of recurrence after undergoing surgery for the disease
. This was the first FDA approval for the adjuvant treatment of patients with this type of cancer. In 2023, updated trial results showed that
people who received nivolumab had a median disease-free survival of 22 months
, compared with about 11 months for those who received a
placebo
.
In 2020, the FDA
approved the immune checkpoint inhibitor avelumab (Bavencio) for people with advanced bladder cancer that has shrunk or stopped growing
after receiving
platinum-based
chemotherapy. The approval is for the use of avelumab as
maintenance therapy
for advanced disease that has not spread (locally advanced) or disease that has spread beyond the bladder (metastatic).
Targeted Therapy
Targeted therapy treats cancer by targeting proteins that control how cancer cells grow, divide, and spread. In 2019,
erdafitinib (Balversa)
became
the first targeted therapy to be approved by FDA to treat patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma
. This drug can be used to treat some patients whose cancers have certain alterations in the
FGFR2 gene
or
FGFR3 gene
. Only about 20% of bladder cancers harbor an FGFR gene alteration.
An ongoing
phase 3 study is comparing erdafitinib with standard chemotherapy
and with pembrolizumab in patients with advanced bladder cancer whose tumors have an FGFR gene
alteration
. This study could help researchers learn whether patients with FGFR-altered bladder cancer benefit more from erdafitinib or an immune checkpoint inhibitor versus chemotherapy.
Combination Therapy
Researchers are testing many combinations of therapies for bladder cancer, either by combining several immunotherapy drugs or by combining an immunotherapy drug with another type of treatment.
An early-phase clinical trial for patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer is
studying the combination of durvalumab (Imfinzi) with tremelimumab before surgery
. Giving these drugs together before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed.
A phase 3 trial is
testing chemotherapy and radiation therapy with or without the immune checkpoint inhibitor atezolizumab
in patients with localized muscle-invasive bladder cancer. Combining chemotherapy with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells than chemotherapy alone. Adding
atezolizumab (Tecentriq)
to radiation therapy and chemotherapy may further improve outcomes in patients with localized muscle-invasive bladder cancer.
A study is testing the
safety and efficacy of the combination of the immune checkpoint inhibitor durvalumab and the drug oportuzumab monatox (Vicinium)
for treating bladder cancer that has not spread to the muscle in the bladder. Non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer is early-stage cancer, but it usually comes back after treatment. The two drugs may act together to help the immune system find and destroy cancer cells.
One study is testing the
experimental drug enfortumab vedotin alone and with different combinations of treatments
, including pembrolizumab, for treating bladder cancer. Some parts of the study will focus on patients with locally-advanced and metastatic urothelial cancer, whereas other parts will focus on patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer.
Antibody Drug Conjugates
A
monoclonal antibody
is a type of protein made in the lab that can bind to certain targets in the body, such as those on cancer cells. An antibody drug
conjugate
is a substance made up of a monoclonal antibody that is chemically linked to a drug. It has the ability to kill cancer cells without harming other cells.
The antibody drug conjugate
enfortumab vedotin-ejfv (Padcev)
has been
approved to treat advanced/metastatic bladder cancer
. It showed positive results in patients who had previously been treated with chemotherapy and an immune checkpoint inhibitor. Researchers continue to study this drug to see whether it can be used to treat bladder cancer earlier in the disease process and to evaluate it in combination with immunotherapy and/or chemotherapy.
The combination of enfortumab vedotin-ejfv and pembrolizumab is also
being evaluated as a treatment for patients with previously untreated advanced bladder cancer
.
Gene Therapy
In 2022, the FDA approved a type of
gene therapy
called
nadofaragene firadenovec-vncg (Adstiladrin)
for some
adults with a certain type of high-risk, non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer
. By helping the immune system recognize and kill cancer cells, this treatment can benefit patients whose tumors don’t respond to the commonly used BCG therapy.

NCI funds and oversees both early- and late-phase clinical trials to develop new treatments and improve patient care. Trials are available for
bladder cancer treatment
.
NCI-Supported Research Programs
