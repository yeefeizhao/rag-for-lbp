<page><title>Bladder Cancer Stages</title><url>https://www.cancer.gov/types/bladder/stages</url><content>Bladder Cancer Stages
Cancer stage describes the extent of cancer in the body, such as the size of the
tumor
, whether it has spread, and how far it has spread from where it first formed. It’s important to know the stage of
bladder cancer
to plan treatment.
There are several different
staging systems
for cancer. Bladder cancer is usually staged using the
TNM staging system
. Your cancer may be described by this staging system in your
pathology report
. Based on the TNM results, a stage is assigned to your cancer, such as stage I, stage II, stage III, or stage IV (may also be written as stage 1, stage 2, stage 3, or stage 4). When talking with you about your cancer, your doctor may describe it as one of these stages.

Stage 0 (noninvasive papillary carcinoma and carcinoma in situ)
Enlarge
Stage 0 bladder cancer (noninvasive bladder cancer). Cancer cells are found in tissue lining the inside of the bladder but have not invaded into the bladder wall. Stage 0a (also called noninvasive papillary carcinoma) may look like long, thin growths extending into the bladder lumen (the space where urine collects). Stage 0is (also called carcinoma in situ) is a flat tumor on the tissue lining the inside of the bladder.
Stage 0 refers to noninvasive bladder cancer. This means that cancer cells are found in
tissue
lining the inside of the
bladder
but have not invaded the bladder wall. Stage 0 is divided into stages 0a and 0is, depending on the type of tumor:
Stage 0a
is also called noninvasive papillary carcinoma, which may look like long, thin growths extending into the bladder lumen (the space where urine collects). Stage 0a can be
low grade
or
high grade
, depending on how
abnormal
the cells look under the microscope (see the section on
Bladder cancer grade
).
Stage 0is
is also called carcinoma in situ, which is a flat tumor on the tissue lining the inside of the bladder. Stage 0is is always high grade (see the section on
Bladder cancer grade
).

Stage I bladder cancer
Stage I is a form of non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer that has spread into the
connective tissue
but has not reached the muscle layers of the bladder.

Stage III bladder cancer
Stage III may also be described as
locally advanced
bladder cancer. Stage III is divided into stages IIIA and IIIB.
In stage IIIA
cancer has grown all the way through the bladder muscles and bladder wall into the layer of fat surrounding the bladder and may have spread to the reproductive organs (
prostate
,
seminal vesicles
,
uterus
, or
vagina
) but has not spread to
lymph nodes
; or
cancer has spread to one lymph node in the
pelvis
that is not near the major
arteries
in the pelvis, called the common iliac arteries.

Stage IIIA bladder cancer. Cancer (a) has grown all the way through the bladder muscles and bladder wall into the layer of fat around the bladder and may have spread to the prostate and/or seminal vesicles in men or the uterus and/or vagina in women but has not spread to lymph nodes; or (b) has spread to one lymph node in the pelvis that is not near the common iliac arteries.
In stage IIIB, cancer has spread to more than one lymph node in the pelvis that is not near the common iliac arteries or to at least one lymph node that is near the common iliac arteries.

Stage IV bladder cancer
Stage IV is divided into stages IVA and IVB.
In stage IVA
cancer has spread to the abdominal wall or
pelvic wall
; or
cancer has spread to lymph nodes that are above the major arteries in the pelvis, called the common iliac arteries.
In stage IVB, cancer has spread to other parts of the body, such as the lung, bone, or liver.

Stage IVA and IVB bladder cancer. In stage IVA, cancer has spread to (a) the abdominal or pelvic wall; or (b) lymph nodes above the common iliac arteries. In stage IVB, cancer has spread to (c) other parts of the body, such as the lung, liver, or bone.
Stage IV bladder cancer is also called metastatic bladder cancer. Metastatic cancer happens when cancer cells travel through the
lymphatic system
or blood and form tumors in other parts of the body. The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if bladder cancer spreads to the lung, the cancer cells in the lung are actually bladder cancer cells. The disease is called metastatic bladder cancer, not lung cancer. Learn more in

Bladder cancer grade
Cancer grade describes how abnormal the bladder cancer cells look under a microscope and how quickly the cancer cells are likely to grow and spread. Your doctor uses grade and other factors about your cancer, such as its stage, to form a treatment plan and in some cases, to estimate your
prognosis
.
Low-grade bladder cancer
cells look more like normal cells and tend to grow and spread more slowly than high-grade cancer cells.
High-grade bladder cancer
tends to grow and spread more quickly than low-grade bladder cancer. High-grade cancers usually have a worse prognosis than low-grade cancers and may need treatment right away or treatment that is more aggressive
To learn more, see
Tumor Grade
.
Recurrent bladder cancer
Recurrent bladder cancer is cancer that has recurred (come back) after it has been treated. Bladder cancer tends to recur after treatment, even when it is noninvasive at the time of diagnosis. Low-grade bladder cancer mainly recurs in the bladder lining. High-grade bladder cancer is more likely to have spread to the muscle layers or other parts of the body when it recurs. Tests will be done to help determine where the cancer has returned in your body, if it has spread, and how far. The type of treatment that you have for recurrent bladder cancer will depend on where it has come back.
