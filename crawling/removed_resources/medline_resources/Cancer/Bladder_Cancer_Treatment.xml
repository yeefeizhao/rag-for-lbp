Different types of treatment are available for
bladder cancer
. You and your cancer care team will work together to decide your treatment plan, which may include more than one type of treatment. Many factors will be considered, such as the
stage
and
grade
of the cancer, your overall health, and your preferences. Your plan will include information about your cancer, the goals of treatment, your treatment options and the possible side effects, and the expected length of treatment.
It will be helpful to talk with your cancer care team before treatment begins about what to expect. Some things you’ll want to learn about include what you need to do before treatment begins, how you’ll feel while going through it, and what kind of help you will need. To learn more, see
Questions to Ask Your Doctor about Your Treatment

For treatment by stage, see
Treatment of Bladder Cancer by Stage
.
Surgery
Surgery is the main treatment for bladder cancer. The type of surgery depends on where the cancer is located.  
Other treatments may be given in addition to surgery:
Treatment given before surgery is called preoperative therapy or neoadjuvant therapy. Chemotherapy may be given before surgery to shrink the
tumor
and reduce the amount of tissue that needs to be removed during surgery.
Treatment given after surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy. After the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen, some patients may be given chemotherapy, radiation therapy, immunotherapy, and/or targeted therapy to kill any cancer cells that are left.

Surgery to Treat Cancer

The types of surgery done to treat bladder cancer are:
Transurethral resection (TUR) with fulguration
During TUR with fulguration, the doctor inserts a cystoscope (a thin lighted tube) into the
bladder
through the
urethra
. A tool with a small wire loop on the end is then used to remove the cancer or to burn the tumor away with high-energy electricity. This is known as fulguration.
Partial cystectomy
Partial cystectomy is surgery to remove part of the bladder. This may be done for patients who have a
low-grade
tumor that has invaded the wall of the bladder but is limited to one area of the bladder. Because only a part of the bladder is removed, patients are able to urinate normally after recovering from this surgery. This is also called segmental cystectomy.
Radical cystectomy with urinary diversion
Radical cystectomy is surgery to remove the bladder and any
lymph nodes
and nearby organs that contain cancer. This surgery may be done when the bladder cancer invades the muscle layers or when non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer involves a large part of the bladder:
In men, the nearby organs that are removed are the
prostate
and the
seminal vesicles
.
In women, the
uterus
, the
ovaries
, and part of the
vagina
are removed.
Sometimes, when the cancer has spread outside the bladder and can’t be completely removed, surgery to remove only the bladder may be done to reduce urinary symptoms caused by the cancer.
When the bladder must be removed, the surgeon performs a procedure called urinary diversion to create another way for the body to store and pass urine. It may involve redirecting urine into the
colon
, using
catheters
to drain the bladder, or making an opening in the
abdomen
that connects to a bag outside the body for collecting urine. To learn more, see the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases page on
Urinary Diversion
.
Radiation therapy
Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. Bladder cancer is sometimes treated with external beam radiation therapy. This type of radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the area of the body with cancer. Radiation therapy may be given alone or with other types of treatment, such as chemotherapy.
To learn more, see
External Beam Radiation Therapy for Cancer
and
Radiation Therapy Side Effects
.
Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy (also called chemo) uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Chemotherapy may be given alone or with other types of treatment. The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.
Systemic chemotherapy
Systemic chemotherapy for bladder cancer is when chemotherapy drugs are
injected
into a vein. When given this way, the drugs enter the bloodstream to reach cancer cells throughout the body.  Systemic chemotherapy drugs that may be used to treat bladder cancer are
carboplatin
cisplatin
doxorubicin
fluorouracil
(5-FU)
gemcitabine
methotrexate
mitomycin
paclitaxel
vinblastine
Combinations of these drugs may be used. Other chemotherapy drugs not listed here may also be used.
Intravesical chemotherapy
For bladder cancer, chemotherapy may be intravesical, meaning it is put into the bladder through a tube inserted into the urethra. Intravesical treatments flush the bladder with drugs that kill cancer cells that remain after surgery. This lowers the chance of the cancer coming back.
Mitomycin and gemcitabine are two chemotherapy drugs given as intravesical chemotherapy to treat bladder cancer. These drugs can also be given systemically.
To learn more about how chemotherapy works, how it is given, common side effects, and more, see
Chemotherapy to Treat Cancer
and
Chemotherapy and You: Support for People With Cancer
.
Immunotherapy
Immunotherapy helps a person’s immune system fight cancer. Your doctor may suggest
biomarker tests
to help predict your response to certain immunotherapy drugs. Learn more about
Biomarker Testing for Cancer Treatment
.
Systemic immunotherapy
Systemic immunotherapy drugs used to treat urothelial cancer (a type of bladder cancer) include
avelumab
nivolumab
pembrolizumab
These drugs work in more than one way to kill cancer cells. They are also considered
targeted therapy
because they target specific changes or substances in cancer cells (see the section on
Targeted therapy
).
Intravesical immunotherapy
BCG (bacillus Calmette-Guérin) is an intravesical immunotherapy drug used to treat bladder cancer. BCG is given in a solution that is placed directly into the bladder using a catheter (thin tube). Intravesical treatments flush the bladder with drugs that kill cancer cells that remain after surgery. This lowers the chance of the cancer coming back.
Immunotherapy uses the body’s immune system to fight cancer. This animation explains one type of immunotherapy called nonspecific immune stimulation that is used to treat cancer.

Immunotherapy to Treat Cancer
and
Immunotherapy Side Effects
.
Targeted therapy
Targeted therapy uses drugs or other substances to block the action of specific
enzymes
, proteins, or other molecules involved in the growth and spread of cancer cells. Your doctor may suggest biomarker tests to help predict your response to certain targeted therapy drugs. Learn more about
Biomarker Testing for Cancer
.
Targeted therapies used to treat bladder cancer include
enfortumab vedotin
erdafitinib
ramucirumab
sacituzumab govitecan-hziy
To learn more, see
Targeted Therapy to Treat Cancer
.
Clinical trials
A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be an option.
Use our
clinical trial search
to find NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are accepting patients. You can search for trials based on the type of cancer, the age of the patient, and where the trials are being done. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the
ClinicalTrials.gov
website.
To learn more about clinical trials, see
Clinical Trials Information for Patients and Caregivers
.
Follow-up testing
Some of the tests that were done to
diagnose or stage
the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests. These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.
