Rate of New Cases and Deaths per 100,000:
The rate of new cases of prostate cancer was 116.5 per 100,000 men per year. The death rate was 19.0 per 100,000 men per year. These rates are age-adjusted and based on 2017–2021 cases and 2018–2022 deaths.
Lifetime Risk of Developing Cancer
: Approximately 12.8 percent of men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer at some point during their lifetime, based on 2018–2021 data, excluding 2020 due to COVID.
Prevalence of This Cancer
: In 2021, there were an estimated 3,399,229 men living with prostate cancer in the United States.

Survival Statistics
How Many People Survive 5 Years Or More after Being Diagnosed with Prostate Cancer?
Relative survival is an estimate of the percentage of patients who would be expected to survive the effects of their cancer. It excludes the risk of dying from other causes. Because survival statistics are based on large groups of people, they cannot be used to predict exactly what will happen to an individual patient. No two patients are entirely alike, and treatment and responses to treatment can vary greatly.
5-Year
Relative Survival
97.5%
Based on data from SEER 22 (Excluding IL/MA) 2014–2020. Gray figures represent those who have died from prostate cancer. Green figures represent those who have survived 5 years or more.

Survival by Stage
Cancer stage at diagnosis, which refers to extent of a cancer in the body, determines treatment options and has a strong influence on the length of survival. In general, if the cancer is found only in the part of the body where it started it is
localized
(sometimes referred to as stage 1). If it has spread to a different part of the body, the stage is
regional
or
distant
. For prostate cancer, 69.4% are diagnosed at the local stage. The 5-year relative survival for localized prostate cancer is 100.0%.

In 2024, it is estimated that there will be 299,010 new cases of prostate cancer and an estimated 35,250 people will die of this disease.
Who Gets This Cancer?
Prostate cancer occurs only in men, and it is more common in older men than younger men.  It is more likely to occur in men with a family history of prostate cancer and men of African American descent. The rate of new cases of prostate cancer was 116.5 per 100,000 men per year based on 2017–2021 cases, age-adjusted.

Who Dies From This Cancer?
Because we have screening for prostate cancer, most of the time it is caught before it spreads to other parts of the body. Men who have prostate cancer that is characterized as localized or regional are not as likely to die as men whose cancer is distant. In general prostate cancer has excellent survival rates, but death rates are higher in African American men, men who have advanced stage cancer, and men who are between the ages of 75 and 84. Prostate cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer death in the United States. The death rate was 19.0 per 100,000 men per year based on 2018–2022, age-adjusted.

Trends in Rates
Changes Over Time
Keeping track of new cases, deaths, and survival over time (trends) can help scientists understand whether progress is being made and where additional research is needed to address challenges, such as improving screening or finding better treatments.
Using statistical models for analysis, age-adjusted rates for new prostate cancer cases have been rising on average 0.9% each year over 2012–2021. Age-adjusted death rates have been falling on average 0.5% each year over 2013–2022. 5-year relative survival trends are shown below.

Figure: Prostate and Nearby Organs
Figure: Anatomy diagram shows the prostate, urethra, penis, testicle, bladder, lymph nodes, seminal vesicle, and rectum are labeled. An inset provides a close-up view of the prostate, urethra, bladder, seminal vesicles, and rectum.
This cancer forms in tissues of the prostate  (a gland in the male reproductive system found below the bladder and in front  of the rectum). The prostate surrounds the urethra, the  tube through which urine flows. A healthy prostate is about the size of a  walnut. If the prostate grows too large, it squeezes the urethra. This may slow  or stop the normal flow of urine. Prostate cancer usually occurs in older  men.

The rate of new cases of prostate cancer was 116.5 per 100,000 men per year. The death rate was 19.0 per 100,000 men per year. These rates are age-adjusted and based on 2017–2021 cases and 2018–2022 deaths.
Lifetime Risk of Developing Cancer
: Approximately 12.8 percent of men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer at some point during their lifetime, based on 2018–2021 data, excluding 2020 due to COVID.
Prevalence of This Cancer

Survival Statistics
How Many People Survive 5 Years Or More after Being Diagnosed with Prostate Cancer?
Relative survival is an estimate of the percentage of patients who would be expected to survive the effects of their cancer. It excludes the risk of dying from other causes. Because survival statistics are based on large groups of people, they cannot be used to predict exactly what will happen to an individual patient. No two patients are entirely alike, and treatment and responses to treatment can vary greatly.
5-Year
Relative Survival
97.5%
Based on data from SEER 22 (Excluding IL/MA) 2014–2020. Gray figures represent those who have died from prostate cancer. Green figures represent those who have survived 5 years or more.

Survival by Stage
Cancer stage at diagnosis, which refers to extent of a cancer in the body, determines treatment options and has a strong influence on the length of survival. In general, if the cancer is found only in the part of the body where it started it is
localized
(sometimes referred to as stage 1). If it has spread to a different part of the body, the stage is
regional
or
distant
. For prostate cancer, 69.4% are diagnosed at the local stage. The 5-year relative survival for localized prostate cancer is 100.0%.

In 2024, it is estimated that there will be 299,010 new cases of prostate cancer and an estimated 35,250 people will die of this disease.
Who Gets This Cancer?
Prostate cancer occurs only in men, and it is more common in older men than younger men.  It is more likely to occur in men with a family history of prostate cancer and men of African American descent. The rate of new cases of prostate cancer was 116.5 per 100,000 men per year based on 2017–2021 cases, age-adjusted.

Who Dies From This Cancer?
Because we have screening for prostate cancer, most of the time it is caught before it spreads to other parts of the body. Men who have prostate cancer that is characterized as localized or regional are not as likely to die as men whose cancer is distant. In general prostate cancer has excellent survival rates, but death rates are higher in African American men, men who have advanced stage cancer, and men who are between the ages of 75 and 84. Prostate cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer death in the United States. The death rate was 19.0 per 100,000 men per year based on 2018–2022, age-adjusted.

Trends in Rates
Changes Over Time
Keeping track of new cases, deaths, and survival over time (trends) can help scientists understand whether progress is being made and where additional research is needed to address challenges, such as improving screening or finding better treatments.
Using statistical models for analysis, age-adjusted rates for new prostate cancer cases have been rising on average 0.9% each year over 2012–2021. Age-adjusted death rates have been falling on average 0.5% each year over 2013–2022. 5-year relative survival trends are shown below.

Figure: Prostate and Nearby Organs
Figure: Anatomy diagram shows the prostate, urethra, penis, testicle, bladder, lymph nodes, seminal vesicle, and rectum are labeled. An inset provides a close-up view of the prostate, urethra, bladder, seminal vesicles, and rectum.
This cancer forms in tissues of the prostate  (a gland in the male reproductive system found below the bladder and in front  of the rectum). The prostate surrounds the urethra, the  tube through which urine flows. A healthy prostate is about the size of a  walnut. If the prostate grows too large, it squeezes the urethra. This may slow  or stop the normal flow of urine. Prostate cancer usually occurs in older  men.
