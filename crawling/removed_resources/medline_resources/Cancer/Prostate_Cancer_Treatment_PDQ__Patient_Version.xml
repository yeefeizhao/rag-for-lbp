Key Points
Prostate cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells
		  form in the tissues of the prostate.
Signs of prostate cancer include a weak flow of urine
		  or frequent urination.
Tests that examine the prostate and blood are used to diagnose prostate cancer.
A biopsy is done to diagnose prostate cancer and find out the grade of the cancer (Gleason score).
Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.
Prostate cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells
		  form in the tissues of the prostate.
The
prostate
is a
gland
in the male
reproductive system
. It lies just
		  below the
bladder
(the
organ
that
		  collects and empties
urine
) and in
		  front of the
rectum
(the lower part
		  of the
intestine
). It is about the
		  size of a walnut and surrounds part of the
urethra
(the tube that empties urine from the
		  bladder). The prostate gland makes
fluid
that is part of the
semen
.

Prostate cancer
is most common in older men. In the U.S., about 1 out of 8 men will be
diagnosed
with prostate cancer.
Signs of prostate cancer include a weak flow of urine
		  or frequent urination.
These and other
signs
and
symptoms
may be caused by prostate cancer or by other
conditions
. Check with your doctor if you have any of the  following:
Trouble starting the flow of urine.
Frequent urination (especially at night).
Trouble emptying the bladder completely.
Weak or interrupted ("stop-and-go") flow of urine.
When prostate cancer is detected in an
advanced
stage
, symptoms may include:
Pain in the back, hips, or
pelvis
that doesn't go away.
Shortness of breath, feeling very tired, fast heartbeat, dizziness, or pale skin caused by
anemia
.
Other conditions may cause the same symptoms. As men age, the prostate may get bigger and block the
		  urethra or bladder. This may cause trouble urinating  or sexual problems. The condition is called
benign prostatic hyperplasia
(BPH), and although
		  it is not cancer,
surgery
may be
		  needed. The symptoms
		  of benign prostatic hyperplasia or of other problems in the prostate may be
		  like symptoms of prostate cancer.
Enlarge
Normal prostate and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). A normal prostate does not block the flow of urine from the bladder. An enlarged prostate  presses on the bladder and urethra and blocks the flow of urine.
Tests that examine the prostate and blood are used to diagnose prostate cancer.
The following tests and procedures may be used:
Physical exam
and
health history
: An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patient’s health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.
Digital rectal
			 exam
(DRE)
: An exam of the rectum.  The doctor or
nurse
inserts a lubricated, gloved finger into the rectum and feels the prostate through the rectal wall for lumps or
abnormal
areas.
Enlarge
Digital rectal exam (DRE). The doctor inserts a gloved, lubricated finger into the rectum and feels the rectum, anus, and prostate (in males) to check for anything abnormal.
Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test
: A test that measures the level of
PSA
in the blood.  PSA is a substance made by the prostate that may be found in higher than normal amounts in the blood of men who have prostate cancer.  PSA levels may also be high in men who have an
infection
or
inflammation
of the prostate or BPH (an enlarged, but noncancerous, prostate).
PSMA PET scan
: An
imaging procedure
that is used to help find prostate cancer
cells
that have spread outside of the prostate, into bone,
lymph nodes
, or other
organs
. For this procedure, a cell-targeting
molecule
linked to a
radioactive
substance is
injected
into the body and travels through the
blood
. It attaches to a
protein
called
prostate-specific membrane antigen
(PSMA) that is found on the surface of prostate cancer cells. A PET scanner detects high concentrations of the radioactive molecule and shows where the prostate cancer cells are in the body. A PSMA PET scan may be used to help
diagnose
prostate cancer that may have come back or spread to other parts of the body. It may also be used to help plan treatment.
Transrectal
			 ultrasound
: A procedure in which a
probe
that is about the size of a finger is inserted into the rectum to check the prostate.  The probe is used to bounce high-energy sound waves (
ultrasound
) off internal
tissues
or organs and make echoes.  The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a
sonogram
.  Transrectal ultrasound may be used during a
biopsy
procedure. This is called transrectal ultrasound guided biopsy.

Transrectal ultrasound. An ultrasound probe is inserted into the rectum  to check the prostate.  The probe bounces sound waves off body tissues to  make echoes that  form a sonogram (computer picture) of the prostate.
Transrectal
magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI)
: A procedure that uses a strong magnet,
radio waves
, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. A probe that gives off radio waves is inserted into the rectum near the prostate. This helps the MRI machine make clearer pictures of the prostate and nearby tissue. A transrectal MRI is done to find out if the cancer has spread outside the prostate into nearby tissues. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI). Transrectal MRI may be used during a biopsy procedure. This is called transrectal MRI guided biopsy.
A biopsy is done to diagnose prostate cancer and find out the grade of the cancer (Gleason score).
A
transrectal biopsy
is used to diagnose prostate cancer. A transrectal biopsy is the removal of tissue from the prostate by inserting a thin needle through the rectum and into the prostate. This procedure may be done using transrectal ultrasound or transrectal MRI to help guide where samples of tissue are taken from. A
pathologist
views the tissue under a
microscope
to look for cancer
cells
.
Enlarge
Transrectal biopsy. An ultrasound probe is inserted into the rectum to show where the tumor is. Then a needle is inserted through the rectum into the prostate to remove tissue from the prostate.
Sometimes a biopsy is done using a sample of tissue that was removed during a
transurethral resection of the prostate
(TURP) to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia.
If  cancer is found, the pathologist will give the cancer a
grade
. The grade of the cancer describes how
abnormal
the cancer cells look under a microscope and how quickly the cancer is likely to grow and spread. The grade of the cancer is called the
Gleason score
.
To give the cancer a grade, the pathologist checks the prostate tissue samples to see how much the
tumor
tissue is like the normal prostate tissue and to find the two main cell patterns. The primary pattern describes the most common tissue pattern, and the secondary pattern describes the next most common pattern. Each pattern is given a grade from 3 to 5, with grade 3 looking the most like normal prostate tissue and grade 5 looking the most abnormal. The two grades are then added to get a Gleason score.
The Gleason score can range from 6 to 10. The higher the Gleason score, the more likely the cancer will grow and spread quickly. A Gleason score of 6 is a
low-grade
cancer; a score of 7 is a medium-grade cancer; and a score of 8, 9, or 10 is a
high-grade
cancer. For example, if the most common tissue pattern is grade 3 and the secondary pattern is grade 4, it means that most of the cancer is grade 3 and less of the cancer is grade 4. The grades are added for a Gleason score of 7, and it is a medium-grade cancer. The Gleason score may be written as 3+4=7, Gleason 7/10, or combined Gleason score of 7.
Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.
The
prognosis
and treatment options depend on the following:
The
stage
of the cancer (level of PSA, Gleason score,
Grade Group
, how much of the prostate is affected by the cancer, and whether the cancer has spread to other places in the
		  body).
The patient’s age.
Whether the cancer has just been diagnosed or has
recurred
(come back).
Treatment options also may depend on the following:
Whether the patient has other health problems.
The expected
side effects
of treatment.
Past treatment for prostate cancer.
The wishes of the patient.
Most men diagnosed with prostate cancer do not die of it.
Stages of Prostate Cancer
Key Points
After prostate cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to
		  find out if cancer cells have spread within the prostate or to other parts of
		  the body.
There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.
Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.
The Grade Group and PSA level are used to stage prostate cancer.
The following stages are used for prostate cancer:
Stage I
Stage II
Stage III
Stage IV
Prostate cancer may recur (come back) after it has been treated.
After prostate cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to
		  find out if cancer cells have spread within the prostate or to other parts of
		  the body.
The process used to find out if
cancer
has spread within the
prostate
or to other parts of the
		  body is called
staging
. The information gathered from the
		  staging process determines the
stage
of the disease. It is
		  important to know the stage  in order to plan treatment. The results of the tests used to
diagnose
prostate cancer
are often also used to stage the disease. (See the
General Information section
.) In prostate cancer, staging tests may not be done unless the patient has
symptoms
or signs that the cancer has spread, such as bone pain, a high
PSA
level, or a high
Gleason score
.
The following tests and procedures also may be used in the staging process:
Bone
			 scan
: A procedure to check if there are rapidly dividing
cells
, such as cancer cells, in the bone.  A very small amount of
radioactive
material is
injected
into a
vein
and travels through the bloodstream.  The radioactive material collects in the bones with cancer and is detected by a
scanner
.
Enlarge
Bone scan. A small amount of radioactive material is injected into the patient's bloodstream and collects in abnormal cells in the bones. As the patient lies on a table that slides under the scanner, the radioactive material is detected and images are made on a computer screen or film.
MRI
(magnetic
		  resonance imaging)
: A procedure that uses a magnet,
radio waves
, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).
CT scan
(CAT scan)
:
		  A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles.  The pictures are made by a computer linked to an
x-ray
machine. A
dye
may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the
organs
or
tissues
show up more clearly.  This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.
Pelvic lymphadenectomy
:
			 A
surgical
procedure to remove the
lymph nodes
in the
pelvis
.  A
pathologist
views the tissue under a
microscope
to look for cancer cells.
Seminal vesicle biopsy
: The removal of
fluid
from the
seminal vesicles
(
glands
that make
semen
) using a needle.  A pathologist views the fluid under a microscope to look for cancer cells.
ProstaScint scan
: A procedure to check for cancer that has spread from the prostate to other parts of the body, such as the lymph nodes.  A very small amount of radioactive material is injected into a vein and travels through the bloodstream.  The radioactive material attaches to prostate cancer cells and is detected by a scanner. The radioactive material shows up as a bright spot on the picture in areas where there are a lot of prostate cancer cells.
There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.
Cancer can spread through
tissue
, the
lymph system
, and the
blood
:
Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.
Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the
lymph vessels
to other parts of the body.
Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the
blood vessels
to other parts of the body.
Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.
When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called
metastasis
. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the
primary tumor
) and travel through the lymph system or blood.
Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a
tumor
(
metastatic
tumor) in another part of the body.
Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.
The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if  prostate cancer spreads to the bone, the cancer cells in the bone are actually prostate cancer cells. The disease is metastatic prostate cancer, not bone cancer.
Denosumab
, a
monoclonal antibody
, may be used to
prevent
bone metastases
.
Many cancer deaths are caused when cancer moves from the original tumor and spreads to other tissues and organs. This is called metastatic cancer. This animation shows how cancer cells travel from the place in the body where they first formed to other parts of the body.
The Grade Group and PSA level are used to stage prostate cancer.
The stage of the cancer is based on the results of the staging and
diagnostic tests
, including the
prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test
and the
Grade Group
. The tissue samples removed during the
biopsy
are used to find out the Gleason score. The Gleason score ranges from 2 to 10 and describes how different the cancer cells look from normal cells under a
microscope
and how likely it is that the
tumor
will spread. The lower the number, the more cancer cells look like normal cells and are likely to grow and spread slowly.
The Grade Group depends on the Gleason score. See the
General Information
section for more information about the Gleason score.
Grade Group 1 is a Gleason score of 6 or less.
Grade Group 2 or 3 is a Gleason score of 7.
Grade Group 4 is a Gleason score 8.
Grade Group 5 is a Gleason score of 9 or 10.
The PSA test measures the level of PSA in the blood. PSA is a substance made by the prostate that may be found in an increased amount in the blood of men who have prostate cancer.
The following stages are used for prostate cancer:
Stage I
Enlarge
Stage I prostate cancer. Cancer is found in the prostate only. The cancer is not felt during a digital rectal exam and is found by needle biopsy done for high prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level or in a sample of tissue removed during surgery for other reasons.

Treatment Option Overview
Key Points
There are different types of treatment for patients with prostate cancer.
Eight types of standard treatment are used:
Watchful waiting
			 or active surveillance
Surgery
Radiation therapy and radiopharmaceutical therapy
Hormone therapy
Chemotherapy
Targeted therapy
Immunotherapy
Bisphosphonate therapy
There are treatments for bone pain caused by bone metastases or hormone therapy.
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical
		  trials.
Cryosurgery
High-intensity–focused ultrasound therapy
Proton beam radiation therapy
Photodynamic therapy
Treatment for prostate cancer may cause side effects.
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
Follow-up tests may be needed.
There are different types of treatment for patients with prostate cancer.
Different types of treatment are available for patients with
prostate cancer
. Some treatments are
standard
(the currently used treatment), and some
		  are being tested in
clinical trials
.
		   A treatment clinical trial is a
research study
meant to help
		  improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients
		  with
cancer
. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the
		  standard treatment, the new
		  treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
Eight types of standard treatment are used:
Watchful waiting
			 or active surveillance
Watchful waiting
and
active surveillance
are treatments used for older men who do not have
signs
or
symptoms
or have other medical
conditions
and for men whose prostate cancer is found during a
screening
test.
Watchful waiting is closely
monitoring
a patient’s condition without giving any treatment until signs or symptoms appear or change. Treatment is given to relieve symptoms and improve
quality of life
.
Active surveillance is closely following a patient's condition without giving any treatment unless there are changes in test results. It is used to find early signs that the condition is getting worse. In active surveillance, patients are given certain exams and tests, including
digital rectal exam
,
PSA test
,
transrectal ultrasound
, and transrectal
needle biopsy
, to check if the cancer is growing. When the cancer begins to grow, treatment is given to
cure
the cancer.
Other terms that are used to describe not giving treatment to cure prostate cancer right after
diagnosis
are observation, watch and wait, and expectant management.
Surgery
Patients in good health  whose
tumor
is in the
prostate
gland
only may be treated with
surgery
to remove the tumor. The following types of surgery are used:
Radical
				prostatectomy
: A surgical procedure to remove the prostate, surrounding
tissue
, and
seminal vesicles
. Removal of nearby
lymph nodes
may be done at the same time. The main types of radical prostatectomy include:
Open radical prostatectomy
: An
incision
(cut) is made in the retropubic area (lower
abdomen
) or the
perineum
(the area between the
anus
and
scrotum
). Surgery is performed through the incision. It is harder for the surgeon to spare the
nerves
near the prostate or to remove nearby lymph nodes with the perineum approach.
Radical laparoscopic prostatectomy
: Several small incisions (cuts) are made in the wall of the abdomen. A
laparoscope
(a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and
lens
for viewing) is inserted through one opening to guide the surgery. Surgical instruments are inserted through the other openings to do the surgery.
Robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy
: Several small cuts are made in the wall of the abdomen, as in regular laparoscopic prostatectomy. The surgeon inserts an instrument with a camera through one of the openings and surgical instruments through the other openings using robotic arms. The camera gives the surgeon a
3-dimensional
view of the prostate and surrounding structures. The surgeon uses the robotic arms to do the surgery while sitting at  a computer monitor near the operating table.
Enlarge
Two types of radical prostatectomy. In a retropubic prostatectomy,  the prostate is removed through an incision in the wall of  the abdomen.  In a perineal prostatectomy, the prostate is removed through an incision in the area between the scrotum and the anus.
Pelvic lymphadenectomy
: A surgical procedure to remove the lymph nodes in the
pelvis
.  A
pathologist
views the tissue under a
microscope
to look for cancer
cells
. If the lymph nodes contain cancer,
				the doctor will not remove the prostate and may recommend other
				treatment.
Transurethral resection of the
				prostate
(TURP): A surgical procedure to remove tissue from the prostate using a
resectoscope
(a thin, lighted tube with a cutting tool) inserted through the
urethra
.  This procedure is done to treat
benign prostatic hypertrophy
and it is sometimes done to relieve symptoms caused by a tumor before other cancer treatment is given. TURP may
				also be done in men whose tumor is in the prostate only and who cannot have a radical prostatectomy.
Enlarge
Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP).  Tissue is removed from the prostate  using a resectoscope (a thin, lighted tube with a cutting tool at the end)  inserted through the urethra. Prostate tissue that is blocking the urethra is cut away and removed through the resectoscope.
In some cases, the nerves that control penile erection can be saved with nerve-sparing surgery.  However, this may not be possible in men with
			 large tumors or tumors that are very close to the nerves.
Possible problems after prostate cancer surgery include the following:
Impotence
.
Leakage of
urine
from the
bladder
or
stool
from the
rectum
.
Shortening of the
penis
(1 to 2
centimeters
). The exact  reason for this is not known.
Inguinal
hernia
(bulging  of fat or part of the
small intestine
through  weak muscles into the
groin
). Inguinal hernia may occur more often in men treated with  radical prostatectomy than in  men who have some other types of prostate surgery,
radiation therapy
, or  prostate
biopsy
alone. It is most likely to  occur within the first 2 years after radical prostatectomy.
Radiation therapy and radiopharmaceutical therapy
Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy
x-rays
or other types of
radiation
to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing.  There are different types of radiation therapy:
External radiation therapy
uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the area of the body with cancer.
Conformal radiation
is a type of external radiation therapy that uses a computer to make a
3-dimensional
(3-D) picture of the tumor and shapes the radiation beams to fit the tumor. This allows a high dose of radiation to reach the tumor and causes less damage to nearby healthy tissue.
Hypofractionated radiation therapy
may be given because it has a more convenient treatment schedule. Hypofractionated radiation therapy is radiation treatment in which a larger than usual total
dose
of radiation is given once a day over a shorter period of time (fewer days) compared to standard radiation therapy. Hypofractionated radiation therapy may have worse
side effects
than standard radiation therapy, depending on the schedules used.
Internal radiation therapy
uses a
radioactive
substance sealed in needles,
seeds
, wires, or
catheters
that are placed directly into or near the cancer. In
early-stage
prostate cancer, the radioactive seeds are placed in the prostate  using needles that are inserted through the skin between the scrotum and rectum. The placement of the radioactive seeds in the prostate is guided by images from
transrectal ultrasound
or
computed tomography
(CT). The needles are removed after the radioactive seeds are placed in the prostate.
Radiopharmaceutical
therapy
uses a
radioactive
substance to treat cancer. Radiopharmaceutical therapy includes the following:
Alpha emitter radiation therapy
uses a radioactive substance to treat prostate cancer that has spread to the bone. A radioactive substance called
radium-223
is
injected
into a
vein
and travels through the bloodstream. The radium-223 collects in areas of bone with cancer and kills the cancer cells.
The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and
stage
of the cancer being treated. External radiation therapy, internal radiation therapy, and radiopharmaceutical therapy are used to treat prostate cancer.
Men treated with radiation therapy for prostate cancer have an increased risk of having
bladder
and/or
gastrointestinal
cancer.
Radiation therapy can cause
impotence
and
urinary
problems that may get worse with age.
Hormone therapy
Hormone therapy
is a cancer treatment that removes
hormones
or blocks their action and stops cancer cells from growing.  Hormones are substances made by
glands
in the body and circulated in the bloodstream.   In prostate cancer, male sex hormones can cause prostate cancer to grow.
Drugs
, surgery, or other hormones are used to reduce the amount of male hormones or block them from working. This is called
androgen deprivation therapy
(ADT).
Hormone therapy for prostate cancer may
			 include the following:
Abiraterone acetate
can prevent prostate cancer cells from making
androgens
.  It is used in men with
advanced
prostate cancer that has not gotten better with other hormone therapy. It is also used in men with
high-risk
prostate cancer that has improved with treatments that lower hormone levels.
Orchiectomy
is
				a surgical procedure to remove one or both
testicles
, the main source of male hormones, such as
testosterone
, to decrease
				the amount of hormone being made.
Estrogens
(hormones that promote female sex characteristics) can prevent the
				testicles from making
				testosterone. However, estrogens are seldom used today in the treatment of
				prostate cancer because of the risk of serious side effects.
Luteinizing hormone-releasing
				hormone agonists
can stop the testicles from making
				testosterone. Examples are
leuprolide
,
goserelin
, and
buserelin
.
Antiandrogens
can block the action of androgens
				(hormones that promote male sex characteristics), such as testosterone. Examples are
flutamide
,
bicalutamide
,
enzalutamide
,
apalutamide
,
nilutamide
, and
darolutamide
.
Drugs that can prevent the
adrenal glands
from making androgens include
ketoconazole
,
aminoglutethimide
,
hydrocortisone
, and
progesterone
.
Hot flashes
,
impaired
sexual function, loss of desire for sex, and weakened bones
			 may occur in men treated with hormone therapy.  Other side effects include
diarrhea
,
nausea
, and itching.

Drugs Approved for Prostate Cancer
for more information.
Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy
is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.  When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or
injected
into a
vein
or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (
systemic chemotherapy
).
See
Drugs Approved for Prostate Cancer
for more information.
Targeted therapy
Targeted therapy
is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells. Targeted therapies usually cause less harm to normal cells than chemotherapy or radiation therapy do.
PARP inhibitors
block an
enzyme
involved in many cell functions, including the repair of
DNA
damage. Blocking this enzyme may help keep cancer cells from repairing their damaged DNA, causing them to die.
Olaparib
is a PARP inhibitor used to treat patients with prostate cancer  that has spread to other parts of the body and has
mutations
in certain
genes
, such as
BRCA1
or
BRCA2
.
Immunotherapy
Immunotherapy
is a treatment that uses the patient’s
immune system
to fight cancer.  Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the body’s natural defenses against cancer. This cancer treatment is a type of
biologic therapy
.
Sipuleucel-T
is a type of immunotherapy used to treat prostate cancer that has
metastasized
(spread to other parts of the body).
See
Drugs Approved for Prostate Cancer
for more information.
Bisphosphonate therapy
Bisphosphonate
drugs, such as
clodronate
or
zoledronate
,  reduce bone disease when cancer has spread to the bone. Men who are treated with antiandrogen therapy or orchiectomy are at an increased risk of bone loss. In these men, bisphosphonate drugs lessen the risk of bone fracture (breaks). The use of bisphosphonate drugs to prevent or  slow the growth of bone
metastases
is being studied in clinical trials.
There are treatments for bone pain caused by bone metastases or hormone therapy.
Prostate cancer that has spread to the bone and certain types of hormone therapy can weaken bones and lead to bone pain. Treatments for bone pain include the following:
Pain
medicine
.
External radiation therapy.
Strontium-89
(a
radioisotope
).
Targeted therapy
with a
monoclonal antibody
, such as
denosumab
.
Bisphosphonate therapy.
Corticosteroids
.
See the
PDQ
summary on
Pain
for more information.
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical
		  trials.
This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the
NCI website
.
Cryosurgery
Cryosurgery
is a treatment that uses an instrument to freeze and destroy prostate cancer cells. Ultrasound is used to find the area that will be treated. This type of treatment is also called cryotherapy.
Cryosurgery can cause impotence and leakage of urine from the bladder or stool from the rectum.
High-intensity–focused ultrasound therapy
High-intensity–focused ultrasound therapy
is a treatment that uses ultrasound (high-energy sound waves) to destroy cancer cells.  To treat prostate cancer, an
endorectal
probe
is used to make the sound waves.
Proton beam radiation therapy
Proton beam radiation therapy
is a type of high-energy, external radiation therapy that uses  streams of
protons
(tiny particles with a positive charge) to kill tumor cells. This type of treatment can lower the amount of radiation damage to healthy tissue near a tumor.
Photodynamic therapy
A cancer treatment that uses a drug and a certain type of
laser
light to kill cancer cells. A drug that is not active until it is exposed to light is injected into a vein. The drug collects more in cancer cells than in normal cells.
Fiberoptic
tubes are then used to carry the laser light to the cancer cells, where the drug becomes active and kills the cells.
Photodynamic therapy
causes little damage to healthy tissue. It is used mainly to treat tumors on or just under the skin or in the lining of internal organs.
Treatment for prostate cancer may cause side effects.
For information about
side effects
caused by treatment for cancer, visit our
Side Effects
page.
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
For some patients, taking part in a
clinical trial
may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer  treatments are safe and effective or better than the
standard treatment
.
Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first  to receive a new treatment.
Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.
Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the
side effects
of cancer treatment.
Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about clinical trials supported by NCI can be found on NCI’s
clinical trials search
webpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the
ClinicalTrials.gov
website.
Follow-up tests may be needed.
As you go through treatment, you  will have follow-up tests or check-ups. Some tests that were done to
diagnose
or
stage
the cancer may be repeated to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.
Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back).

About This PDQ Summary
About PDQ
Physician Data Query (PDQ) is the National Cancer Institute's (NCI's) comprehensive cancer information database. The PDQ database contains summaries of the latest published information on cancer prevention, detection, genetics, treatment, supportive care, and complementary and alternative medicine. Most summaries come in two versions. The health professional versions have detailed information written in technical language. The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language. Both versions have cancer information that is accurate and up to date and most versions are also available in
Spanish
.
PDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal government’s center of biomedical research.  The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH.
Purpose of This Summary
This PDQ cancer information summary has current information about the treatment of prostate cancer.  It is meant to inform and help patients, families, and caregivers. It does not give formal guidelines or recommendations for making decisions about health care.
Reviewers and Updates
Editorial Boards write the PDQ cancer information summaries and keep them up to date. These Boards are made up of experts in cancer treatment and other specialties related to cancer. The summaries are reviewed regularly and changes are made when there is new information. The date on each summary ("Updated") is the date of the most recent change.
The information in this patient summary was taken from the health professional version, which is reviewed regularly and updated as needed, by the
PDQ Adult Treatment Editorial Board
.
Clinical Trial Information
A clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become "standard." Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
Clinical trials can be found online at
NCI's website
. For more information, call the

Key Points
Prostate cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells
		  form in the tissues of the prostate.
Signs of prostate cancer include a weak flow of urine
		  or frequent urination.
Tests that examine the prostate and blood are used to diagnose prostate cancer.
A biopsy is done to diagnose prostate cancer and find out the grade of the cancer (Gleason score).
Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.
Prostate cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells
		  form in the tissues of the prostate.
The
prostate
is a
gland
in the male
reproductive system
. It lies just
		  below the
bladder
(the
organ
that
		  collects and empties
urine
) and in
		  front of the
rectum
(the lower part
		  of the
intestine
). It is about the
		  size of a walnut and surrounds part of the
urethra
(the tube that empties urine from the
		  bladder). The prostate gland makes
fluid
that is part of the
semen
.
Enlarge
Anatomy of the  male reproductive and urinary systems showing the ureters, bladder, prostate gland, urethra, penis, testicles, and other organs.
Prostate cancer
is most common in older men. In the U.S., about 1 out of 8 men will be
diagnosed
with prostate cancer.
Signs of prostate cancer include a weak flow of urine
		  or frequent urination.
These and other
signs
and
symptoms
may be caused by prostate cancer or by other
conditions
. Check with your doctor if you have any of the  following:
Trouble starting the flow of urine.
Frequent urination (especially at night).
Trouble emptying the bladder completely.
Weak or interrupted ("stop-and-go") flow of urine.
When prostate cancer is detected in an
advanced
stage
, symptoms may include:
Pain in the back, hips, or
pelvis
that doesn't go away.
Shortness of breath, feeling very tired, fast heartbeat, dizziness, or pale skin caused by
anemia
.
Other conditions may cause the same symptoms. As men age, the prostate may get bigger and block the
		  urethra or bladder. This may cause trouble urinating  or sexual problems. The condition is called
benign prostatic hyperplasia
(BPH), and although
		  it is not cancer,
surgery
may be
		  needed. The symptoms
		  of benign prostatic hyperplasia or of other problems in the prostate may be
		  like symptoms of prostate cancer.
Enlarge
Normal prostate and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). A normal prostate does not block the flow of urine from the bladder. An enlarged prostate  presses on the bladder and urethra and blocks the flow of urine.
Tests that examine the prostate and blood are used to diagnose prostate cancer.
The following tests and procedures may be used:
Physical exam
and
health history
: An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patient’s health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.
Digital rectal
			 exam
(DRE)
: An exam of the rectum.  The doctor or
nurse
inserts a lubricated, gloved finger into the rectum and feels the prostate through the rectal wall for lumps or
abnormal
areas.
Enlarge
Digital rectal exam (DRE). The doctor inserts a gloved, lubricated finger into the rectum and feels the rectum, anus, and prostate (in males) to check for anything abnormal.
Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test
: A test that measures the level of
PSA
in the blood.  PSA is a substance made by the prostate that may be found in higher than normal amounts in the blood of men who have prostate cancer.  PSA levels may also be high in men who have an
infection
or
inflammation
of the prostate or BPH (an enlarged, but noncancerous, prostate).
PSMA PET scan
: An
imaging procedure
that is used to help find prostate cancer
cells
that have spread outside of the prostate, into bone,
lymph nodes
, or other
organs
. For this procedure, a cell-targeting
molecule
linked to a
radioactive
substance is
injected
into the body and travels through the
blood
. It attaches to a
protein
called
prostate-specific membrane antigen
(PSMA) that is found on the surface of prostate cancer cells. A PET scanner detects high concentrations of the radioactive molecule and shows where the prostate cancer cells are in the body. A PSMA PET scan may be used to help
diagnose
prostate cancer that may have come back or spread to other parts of the body. It may also be used to help plan treatment.
Transrectal
			 ultrasound
: A procedure in which a
probe
that is about the size of a finger is inserted into the rectum to check the prostate.  The probe is used to bounce high-energy sound waves (
ultrasound
) off internal
tissues
or organs and make echoes.  The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a
sonogram
.  Transrectal ultrasound may be used during a
biopsy
procedure. This is called transrectal ultrasound guided biopsy.
Enlarge
Transrectal ultrasound. An ultrasound probe is inserted into the rectum  to check the prostate.  The probe bounces sound waves off body tissues to  make echoes that  form a sonogram (computer picture) of the prostate.
Transrectal
magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI)
: A procedure that uses a strong magnet,
radio waves
, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. A probe that gives off radio waves is inserted into the rectum near the prostate. This helps the MRI machine make clearer pictures of the prostate and nearby tissue. A transrectal MRI is done to find out if the cancer has spread outside the prostate into nearby tissues. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI). Transrectal MRI may be used during a biopsy procedure. This is called transrectal MRI guided biopsy.
A biopsy is done to diagnose prostate cancer and find out the grade of the cancer (Gleason score).
A
transrectal biopsy
is used to diagnose prostate cancer. A transrectal biopsy is the removal of tissue from the prostate by inserting a thin needle through the rectum and into the prostate. This procedure may be done using transrectal ultrasound or transrectal MRI to help guide where samples of tissue are taken from. A
pathologist
views the tissue under a
microscope
to look for cancer
cells
.
Enlarge
Transrectal biopsy. An ultrasound probe is inserted into the rectum to show where the tumor is. Then a needle is inserted through the rectum into the prostate to remove tissue from the prostate.
Sometimes a biopsy is done using a sample of tissue that was removed during a
transurethral resection of the prostate
(TURP) to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia.
If  cancer is found, the pathologist will give the cancer a
grade
. The grade of the cancer describes how
abnormal
the cancer cells look under a microscope and how quickly the cancer is likely to grow and spread. The grade of the cancer is called the
Gleason score
.
To give the cancer a grade, the pathologist checks the prostate tissue samples to see how much the
tumor
tissue is like the normal prostate tissue and to find the two main cell patterns. The primary pattern describes the most common tissue pattern, and the secondary pattern describes the next most common pattern. Each pattern is given a grade from 3 to 5, with grade 3 looking the most like normal prostate tissue and grade 5 looking the most abnormal. The two grades are then added to get a Gleason score.
The Gleason score can range from 6 to 10. The higher the Gleason score, the more likely the cancer will grow and spread quickly. A Gleason score of 6 is a
low-grade
cancer; a score of 7 is a medium-grade cancer; and a score of 8, 9, or 10 is a
high-grade
cancer. For example, if the most common tissue pattern is grade 3 and the secondary pattern is grade 4, it means that most of the cancer is grade 3 and less of the cancer is grade 4. The grades are added for a Gleason score of 7, and it is a medium-grade cancer. The Gleason score may be written as 3+4=7, Gleason 7/10, or combined Gleason score of 7.
Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.
The
prognosis
and treatment options depend on the following:
The
stage
of the cancer (level of PSA, Gleason score,
Grade Group
, how much of the prostate is affected by the cancer, and whether the cancer has spread to other places in the
		  body).
The patient’s age.
Whether the cancer has just been diagnosed or has
recurred
(come back).
Treatment options also may depend on the following:
Whether the patient has other health problems.
The expected
side effects
of treatment.
Past treatment for prostate cancer.
The wishes of the patient.
Most men diagnosed with prostate cancer do not die of it.
Stages of Prostate Cancer
Key Points
After prostate cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to
		  find out if cancer cells have spread within the prostate or to other parts of
		  the body.
There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.
Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.
The Grade Group and PSA level are used to stage prostate cancer.
The following stages are used for prostate cancer:
Stage I
Stage II
Stage III
Stage IV
Prostate cancer may recur (come back) after it has been treated.
After prostate cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to
		  find out if cancer cells have spread within the prostate or to other parts of
		  the body.
The process used to find out if
cancer
has spread within the
prostate
or to other parts of the
		  body is called
staging
. The information gathered from the
		  staging process determines the
stage
of the disease. It is
		  important to know the stage  in order to plan treatment. The results of the tests used to
diagnose
prostate cancer
are often also used to stage the disease. (See the
General Information section
.) In prostate cancer, staging tests may not be done unless the patient has
symptoms
or signs that the cancer has spread, such as bone pain, a high
PSA
level, or a high
Gleason score
.
The following tests and procedures also may be used in the staging process:
Bone
			 scan
: A procedure to check if there are rapidly dividing
cells
, such as cancer cells, in the bone.  A very small amount of
radioactive
material is
injected
into a
vein
and travels through the bloodstream.  The radioactive material collects in the bones with cancer and is detected by a
scanner
.
Enlarge
Bone scan. A small amount of radioactive material is injected into the patient's bloodstream and collects in abnormal cells in the bones. As the patient lies on a table that slides under the scanner, the radioactive material is detected and images are made on a computer screen or film.
MRI
(magnetic
		  resonance imaging)
: A procedure that uses a magnet,
radio waves
, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).
CT scan
(CAT scan)
:
		  A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles.  The pictures are made by a computer linked to an
x-ray
machine. A
dye
may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the
organs
or
tissues
show up more clearly.  This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.
Pelvic lymphadenectomy
:
			 A
surgical
procedure to remove the
lymph nodes
in the
pelvis
.  A
pathologist
views the tissue under a
microscope
to look for cancer cells.
Seminal vesicle biopsy
: The removal of
fluid
from the
seminal vesicles
(
glands
that make
semen
) using a needle.  A pathologist views the fluid under a microscope to look for cancer cells.
ProstaScint scan
: A procedure to check for cancer that has spread from the prostate to other parts of the body, such as the lymph nodes.  A very small amount of radioactive material is injected into a vein and travels through the bloodstream.  The radioactive material attaches to prostate cancer cells and is detected by a scanner. The radioactive material shows up as a bright spot on the picture in areas where there are a lot of prostate cancer cells.
There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.
Cancer can spread through
tissue
, the
lymph system
, and the
blood
:
Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.
Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the
lymph vessels
to other parts of the body.
Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the
blood vessels
to other parts of the body.
Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.
When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called
metastasis
. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the
primary tumor
) and travel through the lymph system or blood.
Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a
tumor
(
metastatic
tumor) in another part of the body.
Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.
The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if  prostate cancer spreads to the bone, the cancer cells in the bone are actually prostate cancer cells. The disease is metastatic prostate cancer, not bone cancer.
Denosumab
, a
monoclonal antibody
, may be used to
prevent
bone metastases
.
Many cancer deaths are caused when cancer moves from the original tumor and spreads to other tissues and organs. This is called metastatic cancer. This animation shows how cancer cells travel from the place in the body where they first formed to other parts of the body.
The Grade Group and PSA level are used to stage prostate cancer.
The stage of the cancer is based on the results of the staging and
diagnostic tests
, including the
prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test
and the
Grade Group
. The tissue samples removed during the
biopsy
are used to find out the Gleason score. The Gleason score ranges from 2 to 10 and describes how different the cancer cells look from normal cells under a
microscope
and how likely it is that the
tumor
will spread. The lower the number, the more cancer cells look like normal cells and are likely to grow and spread slowly.
The Grade Group depends on the Gleason score. See the
General Information
section for more information about the Gleason score.
Grade Group 1 is a Gleason score of 6 or less.
Grade Group 2 or 3 is a Gleason score of 7.
Grade Group 4 is a Gleason score 8.
Grade Group 5 is a Gleason score of 9 or 10.
The PSA test measures the level of PSA in the blood. PSA is a substance made by the prostate that may be found in an increased amount in the blood of men who have prostate cancer.
The following stages are used for prostate cancer:
Stage I
Enlarge
Stage I prostate cancer. Cancer is found in the prostate only. The cancer is not felt during a digital rectal exam and is found by needle biopsy done for high prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level or in a sample of tissue removed during surgery for other reasons. The PSA level is less than 10 and the Grade Group is 1; OR the cancer is felt during a digital rectal exam and is found in one-half or less of one side of the prostate. The PSA level is less than 10 and the Grade Group is 1.
In
stage I
,
cancer
is
			 found in the
prostate
only. The cancer:
is not felt during a
digital rectal exam
and is found by
needle biopsy
(done for a high
PSA
level) or in a sample of
tissue

Treatment Option Overview
Key Points
There are different types of treatment for patients with prostate cancer.
Eight types of standard treatment are used:
Watchful waiting
			 or active surveillance
Surgery
Radiation therapy and radiopharmaceutical therapy
Hormone therapy
Chemotherapy
Targeted therapy
Immunotherapy
Bisphosphonate therapy
There are treatments for bone pain caused by bone metastases or hormone therapy.
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical
		  trials.
Cryosurgery
High-intensity–focused ultrasound therapy
Proton beam radiation therapy
Photodynamic therapy
Treatment for prostate cancer may cause side effects.
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
Follow-up tests may be needed.
There are different types of treatment for patients with prostate cancer.
Different types of treatment are available for patients with
prostate cancer
. Some treatments are
standard
(the currently used treatment), and some
		  are being tested in
clinical trials
.
		   A treatment clinical trial is a
research study
meant to help
		  improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients
		  with
cancer
. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the
		  standard treatment, the new
		  treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
Eight types of standard treatment are used:
Watchful waiting
			 or active surveillance
Watchful waiting
and
active surveillance
are treatments used for older men who do not have
signs
or
symptoms
or have other medical
conditions
and for men whose prostate cancer is found during a
screening
test.
Watchful waiting is closely
monitoring
a patient’s condition without giving any treatment until signs or symptoms appear or change. Treatment is given to relieve symptoms and improve
quality of life
.
Active surveillance is closely following a patient's condition without giving any treatment unless there are changes in test results. It is used to find early signs that the condition is getting worse. In active surveillance, patients are given certain exams and tests, including
digital rectal exam
,
PSA test
,
transrectal ultrasound
, and transrectal
needle biopsy
, to check if the cancer is growing. When the cancer begins to grow, treatment is given to
cure
the cancer.
Other terms that are used to describe not giving treatment to cure prostate cancer right after
diagnosis
are observation, watch and wait, and expectant management.
Surgery
Patients in good health  whose
tumor
is in the
prostate
gland
only may be treated with
surgery
to remove the tumor. The following types of surgery are used:
Radical
				prostatectomy
: A surgical procedure to remove the prostate, surrounding
tissue
, and
seminal vesicles
. Removal of nearby
lymph nodes
may be done at the same time. The main types of radical prostatectomy include:
Open radical prostatectomy
: An
incision
(cut) is made in the retropubic area (lower
abdomen
) or the
perineum
(the area between the
anus
and
scrotum
). Surgery is performed through the incision. It is harder for the surgeon to spare the
nerves
near the prostate or to remove nearby lymph nodes with the perineum approach.
Radical laparoscopic prostatectomy
: Several small incisions (cuts) are made in the wall of the abdomen. A
laparoscope
(a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and
lens
for viewing) is inserted through one opening to guide the surgery. Surgical instruments are inserted through the other openings to do the surgery.
Robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy
: Several small cuts are made in the wall of the abdomen, as in regular laparoscopic prostatectomy. The surgeon inserts an instrument with a camera through one of the openings and surgical instruments through the other openings using robotic arms. The camera gives the surgeon a
3-dimensional
view of the prostate and surrounding structures. The surgeon uses the robotic arms to do the surgery while sitting at  a computer monitor near the operating table.
Enlarge
Two types of radical prostatectomy. In a retropubic prostatectomy,  the prostate is removed through an incision in the wall of  the abdomen.  In a perineal prostatectomy, the prostate is removed through an incision in the area between the scrotum and the anus.
Pelvic lymphadenectomy
: A surgical procedure to remove the lymph nodes in the
pelvis
.  A
pathologist
views the tissue under a
microscope
to look for cancer
cells
. If the lymph nodes contain cancer,
				the doctor will not remove the prostate and may recommend other
				treatment.
Transurethral resection of the
				prostate
(TURP): A surgical procedure to remove tissue from the prostate using a
resectoscope
(a thin, lighted tube with a cutting tool) inserted through the
urethra
.  This procedure is done to treat
benign prostatic hypertrophy
and it is sometimes done to relieve symptoms caused by a tumor before other cancer treatment is given. TURP may
				also be done in men whose tumor is in the prostate only and who cannot have a radical prostatectomy.
Enlarge
Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP).  Tissue is removed from the prostate  using a resectoscope (a thin, lighted tube with a cutting tool at the end)  inserted through the urethra. Prostate tissue that is blocking the urethra is cut away and removed through the resectoscope.
In some cases, the nerves that control penile erection can be saved with nerve-sparing surgery.  However, this may not be possible in men with
			 large tumors or tumors that are very close to the nerves.
Possible problems after prostate cancer surgery include the following:
Impotence
.
Leakage of
urine
from the
bladder
or
stool
from the
rectum
.
Shortening of the
penis
(1 to 2
centimeters
). The exact  reason for this is not known.
Inguinal
hernia
(bulging  of fat or part of the
small intestine
through  weak muscles into the
groin
). Inguinal hernia may occur more often in men treated with  radical prostatectomy than in  men who have some other types of prostate surgery,
radiation therapy
, or  prostate
biopsy
alone. It is most likely to  occur within the first 2 years after radical prostatectomy.
Radiation therapy and radiopharmaceutical therapy
Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy
x-rays
or other types of
radiation
to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing.  There are different types of radiation therapy:
External radiation therapy
uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the area of the body with cancer.
Conformal radiation
is a type of external radiation therapy that uses a computer to make a
3-dimensional
(3-D) picture of the tumor and shapes the radiation beams to fit the tumor. This allows a high dose of radiation to reach the tumor and causes less damage to nearby healthy tissue.
Hypofractionated radiation therapy
may be given because it has a more convenient treatment schedule. Hypofractionated radiation therapy is radiation treatment in which a larger than usual total
dose
of radiation is given once a day over a shorter period of time (fewer days) compared to standard radiation therapy. Hypofractionated radiation therapy may have worse
side effects
than standard radiation therapy, depending on the schedules used.
Internal radiation therapy
uses a
radioactive
substance sealed in needles,
seeds
, wires, or
catheters
that are placed directly into or near the cancer. In
early-stage
prostate cancer, the radioactive seeds are placed in the prostate  using needles that are inserted through the skin between the scrotum and rectum. The placement of the radioactive seeds in the prostate is guided by images from
transrectal ultrasound
or
computed tomography
(CT). The needles are removed after the radioactive seeds are placed in the prostate.
Radiopharmaceutical
therapy
uses a
radioactive
substance to treat cancer. Radiopharmaceutical therapy includes the following:
Alpha emitter radiation therapy
uses a radioactive substance to treat prostate cancer that has spread to the bone. A radioactive substance called
radium-223
is
injected
into a
vein
and travels through the bloodstream. The radium-223 collects in areas of bone with cancer and kills the cancer cells.
The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and
stage
of the cancer being treated. External radiation therapy, internal radiation therapy, and radiopharmaceutical therapy are used to treat prostate cancer.
Men treated with radiation therapy for prostate cancer have an increased risk of having
bladder
and/or
gastrointestinal
cancer.
Radiation therapy can cause
impotence
and
urinary
problems that may get worse with age.
Hormone therapy
Hormone therapy
is a cancer treatment that removes
hormones
or blocks their action and stops cancer cells from growing.  Hormones are substances made by
glands
in the body and circulated in the bloodstream.   In prostate cancer, male sex hormones can cause prostate cancer to grow.
Drugs
, surgery, or other hormones are used to reduce the amount of male hormones or block them from working. This is called
androgen deprivation therapy
(ADT).
Hormone therapy for prostate cancer may
			 include the following:
Abiraterone acetate
can prevent prostate cancer cells from making
androgens
.  It is used in men with
advanced
prostate cancer that has not gotten better with other hormone therapy. It is also used in men with
high-risk
prostate cancer that has improved with treatments that lower hormone levels.
Orchiectomy
is
				a surgical procedure to remove one or both
testicles
, the main source of male hormones, such as
testosterone
, to decrease
				the amount of hormone being made.
Estrogens
(hormones that promote female sex characteristics) can prevent the
				testicles from making
				testosterone. However, estrogens are seldom used today in the treatment of
				prostate cancer because of the risk of serious side effects.
Luteinizing hormone-releasing
				hormone agonists
can stop the testicles from making
				testosterone. Examples are
leuprolide
,
goserelin
, and
buserelin
.
Antiandrogens
can block the action of androgens
				(hormones that promote male sex characteristics), such as testosterone. Examples are
flutamide
,
bicalutamide
,
enzalutamide
,
apalutamide
,
nilutamide
, and
darolutamide
.
Drugs that can prevent the
adrenal glands
from making androgens include
ketoconazole
,
aminoglutethimide
,
hydrocortisone
, and
progesterone
.
Hot flashes
,
impaired
sexual function, loss of desire for sex, and weakened bones
			 may occur in men treated with hormone therapy.  Other side effects include
diarrhea
,
nausea
, and itching.
See
Drugs Approved for Prostate Cancer
for more information.
Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy
is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.  When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or
injected
into a
vein
or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (
systemic chemotherapy
).
See
Drugs Approved for Prostate Cancer
for more information.
Targeted therapy
Targeted therapy
is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells. Targeted therapies usually cause less harm to normal cells than chemotherapy or radiation therapy do.
PARP inhibitors
block an
enzyme
involved in many cell functions, including the repair of
DNA
damage. Blocking this enzyme may help keep cancer cells from repairing their damaged DNA, causing them to die.
Olaparib
is a PARP inhibitor used to treat patients with prostate cancer  that has spread to other parts of the body and has
mutations
in certain
genes
, such as
BRCA1
or
BRCA2
.
Immunotherapy
Immunotherapy
is a treatment that uses the patient’s
immune system
to fight cancer.  Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the body’s natural defenses against cancer. This cancer treatment is a type of
biologic therapy
.
Sipuleucel-T
is a type of immunotherapy used to treat prostate cancer that has
metastasized
(spread to other parts of the body).
See
Drugs Approved for Prostate Cancer
for more information.
Bisphosphonate therapy
Bisphosphonate
drugs, such as
clodronate
or
zoledronate
,  reduce bone disease when cancer has spread to the bone. Men who are treated with antiandrogen therapy or orchiectomy are at an increased risk of bone loss. In these men, bisphosphonate drugs lessen the risk of bone fracture (breaks). The use of bisphosphonate drugs to prevent or  slow the growth of bone
metastases
is being studied in clinical trials.
There are treatments for bone pain caused by bone metastases or hormone therapy.
Prostate cancer that has spread to the bone and certain types of hormone therapy can weaken bones and lead to bone pain. Treatments for bone pain include the following:
Pain
medicine
.
External radiation therapy.
Strontium-89
(a
radioisotope
).
Targeted therapy
with a
monoclonal antibody
, such as
denosumab
.
Bisphosphonate therapy.
Corticosteroids
.
See the
PDQ
summary on
Pain
for more information.
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical
		  trials.
This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the
NCI website
.
Cryosurgery
Cryosurgery
is a treatment that uses an instrument to freeze and destroy prostate cancer cells. Ultrasound is used to find the area that will be treated. This type of treatment is also called cryotherapy.
Cryosurgery can cause impotence and leakage of urine from the bladder or stool from the rectum.
High-intensity–focused ultrasound therapy
High-intensity–focused ultrasound therapy
is a treatment that uses ultrasound (high-energy sound waves) to destroy cancer cells.  To treat prostate cancer, an
endorectal
probe
is used to make the sound waves.
Proton beam radiation therapy
Proton beam radiation therapy
is a type of high-energy, external radiation therapy that uses  streams of
protons
(tiny particles with a positive charge) to kill tumor cells. This type of treatment can lower the amount of radiation damage to healthy tissue near a tumor.
Photodynamic therapy
A cancer treatment that uses a drug and a certain type of
laser
light to kill cancer cells. A drug that is not active until it is exposed to light is injected into a vein. The drug collects more in cancer cells than in normal cells.
Fiberoptic
tubes are then used to carry the laser light to the cancer cells, where the drug becomes active and kills the cells.
Photodynamic therapy
causes little damage to healthy tissue. It is used mainly to treat tumors on or just under the skin or in the lining of internal organs.
Treatment for prostate cancer may cause side effects.
For information about
side effects
caused by treatment for cancer, visit our
Side Effects
page.
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
For some patients, taking part in a
clinical trial
may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer  treatments are safe and effective or better than the
standard treatment
.
Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first  to receive a new treatment.
Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.
Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the
side effects
of cancer treatment.
Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about clinical trials supported by NCI can be found on NCI’s
clinical trials search
webpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the
ClinicalTrials.gov
website.
Follow-up tests may be needed.
As you go through treatment, you  will have follow-up tests or check-ups. Some tests that were done to
diagnose
or
stage
the cancer may be repeated to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.
Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back).

About This PDQ Summary
About PDQ
Physician Data Query (PDQ) is the National Cancer Institute's (NCI's) comprehensive cancer information database. The PDQ database contains summaries of the latest published information on cancer prevention, detection, genetics, treatment, supportive care, and complementary and alternative medicine. Most summaries come in two versions. The health professional versions have detailed information written in technical language. The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language. Both versions have cancer information that is accurate and up to date and most versions are also available in
Spanish
.
PDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal government’s center of biomedical research.  The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH.
Purpose of This Summary
This PDQ cancer information summary has current information about the treatment of prostate cancer.  It is meant to inform and help patients, families, and caregivers. It does not give formal guidelines or recommendations for making decisions about health care.
Reviewers and Updates
Editorial Boards write the PDQ cancer information summaries and keep them up to date. These Boards are made up of experts in cancer treatment and other specialties related to cancer. The summaries are reviewed regularly and changes are made when there is new information. The date on each summary ("Updated") is the date of the most recent change.
The information in this patient summary was taken from the health professional version, which is reviewed regularly and updated as needed, by the
PDQ Adult Treatment Editorial Board
.
Clinical Trial Information
A clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become "standard." Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
Clinical trials can be found online at
NCI's website
. For more information, call the
Cancer Information Service
(CIS), NCI's contact center, at 1-800-4-CANCER (1-800-422-6237).

Go to Health Professional Version
Key Points
Prostate cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells
		  form in the tissues of the prostate.
Signs of prostate cancer include a weak flow of urine
		  or frequent urination.
Tests that examine the prostate and blood are used to diagnose prostate cancer.
A biopsy is done to diagnose prostate cancer and find out the grade of the cancer (Gleason score).
Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.
Prostate cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells
		  form in the tissues of the prostate.
The
prostate
is a
gland
in the male
reproductive system
. It lies just
		  below the
bladder
(the
organ
that
		  collects and empties
urine
) and in
		  front of the
rectum
(the lower part
		  of the
intestine
). It is about the
		  size of a walnut and surrounds part of the
urethra
(the tube that empties urine from the
		  bladder). The prostate gland makes
fluid
that is part of the
semen
.

Prostate cancer
is most common in older men. In the U.S., about 1 out of 8 men will be
diagnosed
with prostate cancer.
Signs of prostate cancer include a weak flow of urine
		  or frequent urination.
These and other
signs
and
symptoms
may be caused by prostate cancer or by other
conditions
. Check with your doctor if you have any of the  following:
Trouble starting the flow of urine.
Frequent urination (especially at night).
Trouble emptying the bladder completely.
Weak or interrupted ("stop-and-go") flow of urine.
When prostate cancer is detected in an
advanced
stage
, symptoms may include:
Pain in the back, hips, or
pelvis
that doesn't go away.
Shortness of breath, feeling very tired, fast heartbeat, dizziness, or pale skin caused by
anemia
.
Other conditions may cause the same symptoms. As men age, the prostate may get bigger and block the
		  urethra or bladder. This may cause trouble urinating  or sexual problems. The condition is called
benign prostatic hyperplasia
(BPH), and although
		  it is not cancer,
surgery
may be
		  needed. The symptoms
		  of benign prostatic hyperplasia or of other problems in the prostate may be
		  like symptoms of prostate cancer.
Enlarge
Normal prostate and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). A normal prostate does not block the flow of urine from the bladder. An enlarged prostate  presses on the bladder and urethra and blocks the flow of urine.
Tests that examine the prostate and blood are used to diagnose prostate cancer.
The following tests and procedures may be used:
Physical exam
and
health history
: An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patient’s health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.
Digital rectal
			 exam
(DRE)
: An exam of the rectum.  The doctor or
nurse
inserts a lubricated, gloved finger into the rectum and feels the prostate through the rectal wall for lumps or
abnormal
areas.
Enlarge
Digital rectal exam (DRE). The doctor inserts a gloved, lubricated finger into the rectum and feels the rectum, anus, and prostate (in males) to check for anything abnormal.
Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test
: A test that measures the level of
PSA
in the blood.  PSA is a substance made by the prostate that may be found in higher than normal amounts in the blood of men who have prostate cancer.  PSA levels may also be high in men who have an
infection
or
inflammation
of the prostate or BPH (an enlarged, but noncancerous, prostate).
PSMA PET scan
: An
imaging procedure
that is used to help find prostate cancer
cells
that have spread outside of the prostate, into bone,
lymph nodes
, or other
organs
. For this procedure, a cell-targeting
molecule
linked to a
radioactive
substance is
injected
into the body and travels through the
blood
. It attaches to a
protein
called
prostate-specific membrane antigen
(PSMA) that is found on the surface of prostate cancer cells. A PET scanner detects high concentrations of the radioactive molecule and shows where the prostate cancer cells are in the body. A PSMA PET scan may be used to help
diagnose
prostate cancer that may have come back or spread to other parts of the body. It may also be used to help plan treatment.
Transrectal
			 ultrasound
: A procedure in which a
probe
that is about the size of a finger is inserted into the rectum to check the prostate.  The probe is used to bounce high-energy sound waves (
ultrasound
) off internal
tissues
or organs and make echoes.  The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a
sonogram
.  Transrectal ultrasound may be used during a
biopsy
procedure. This is called transrectal ultrasound guided biopsy.
Enlarge
Transrectal ultrasound. An ultrasound probe is inserted into the rectum  to check the prostate.  The probe bounces sound waves off body tissues to  make echoes that  form a sonogram (computer picture) of the prostate.
Transrectal
magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI)
: A procedure that uses a strong magnet,
radio waves
, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. A probe that gives off radio waves is inserted into the rectum near the prostate. This helps the MRI machine make clearer pictures of the prostate and nearby tissue. A transrectal MRI is done to find out if the cancer has spread outside the prostate into nearby tissues. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI). Transrectal MRI may be used during a biopsy procedure. This is called transrectal MRI guided biopsy.
A biopsy is done to diagnose prostate cancer and find out the grade of the cancer (Gleason score).
A
transrectal biopsy
is used to diagnose prostate cancer. A transrectal biopsy is the removal of tissue from the prostate by inserting a thin needle through the rectum and into the prostate. This procedure may be done using transrectal ultrasound or transrectal MRI to help guide where samples of tissue are taken from. A
pathologist
views the tissue under a
microscope
to look for cancer
cells
.
Enlarge
Transrectal biopsy. An ultrasound probe is inserted into the rectum to show where the tumor is. Then a needle is inserted through the rectum into the prostate to remove tissue from the prostate.
Sometimes a biopsy is done using a sample of tissue that was removed during a
transurethral resection of the prostate
(TURP) to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia.
If  cancer is found, the pathologist will give the cancer a
grade
. The grade of the cancer describes how
abnormal
the cancer cells look under a microscope and how quickly the cancer is likely to grow and spread. The grade of the cancer is called the
Gleason score
.
To give the cancer a grade, the pathologist checks the prostate tissue samples to see how much the
tumor
tissue is like the normal prostate tissue and to find the two main cell patterns. The primary pattern describes the most common tissue pattern, and the secondary pattern describes the next most common pattern. Each pattern is given a grade from 3 to 5, with grade 3 looking the most like normal prostate tissue and grade 5 looking the most abnormal. The two grades are then added to get a Gleason score.
The Gleason score can range from 6 to 10. The higher the Gleason score, the more likely the cancer will grow and spread quickly. A Gleason score of 6 is a
low-grade
cancer; a score of 7 is a medium-grade cancer; and a score of 8, 9, or 10 is a
high-grade
cancer. For example, if the most common tissue pattern is grade 3 and the secondary pattern is grade 4, it means that most of the cancer is grade 3 and less of the cancer is grade 4. The grades are added for a Gleason score of 7, and it is a medium-grade cancer. The Gleason score may be written as 3+4=7, Gleason 7/10, or combined Gleason score of 7.
Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.
The
prognosis
and treatment options depend on the following:
The
stage
of the cancer (level of PSA, Gleason score,
Grade Group
, how much of the prostate is affected by the cancer, and whether the cancer has spread to other places in the
		  body).
The patient’s age.
Whether the cancer has just been diagnosed or has
recurred
(come back).
Treatment options also may depend on the following:
Whether the patient has other health problems.
The expected
side effects
of treatment.
Past treatment for prostate cancer.
The wishes of the patient.
Most men diagnosed with prostate cancer do not die of it.
Stages of Prostate Cancer
Key Points
After prostate cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to
		  find out if cancer cells have spread within the prostate or to other parts of
		  the body.
There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.
Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.
The Grade Group and PSA level are used to stage prostate cancer.
The following stages are used for prostate cancer:
Stage I
Stage II
Stage III
Stage IV
Prostate cancer may recur (come back) after it has been treated.
After prostate cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to
		  find out if cancer cells have spread within the prostate or to other parts of
		  the body.
The process used to find out if
cancer
has spread within the
prostate
or to other parts of the
		  body is called
staging
. The information gathered from the
		  staging process determines the
stage
of the disease. It is
		  important to know the stage  in order to plan treatment. The results of the tests used to
diagnose
prostate cancer
are often also used to stage the disease. (See the
General Information section
.) In prostate cancer, staging tests may not be done unless the patient has
symptoms
or signs that the cancer has spread, such as bone pain, a high
PSA
level, or a high
Gleason score
.
The following tests and procedures also may be used in the staging process:
Bone
			 scan
: A procedure to check if there are rapidly dividing
cells
, such as cancer cells, in the bone.  A very small amount of
radioactive
material is
injected
into a
vein
and travels through the bloodstream.  The radioactive material collects in the bones with cancer and is detected by a
scanner
.
Enlarge
Bone scan. A small amount of radioactive material is injected into the patient's bloodstream and collects in abnormal cells in the bones. As the patient lies on a table that slides under the scanner, the radioactive material is detected and images are made on a computer screen or film.
MRI
(magnetic
		  resonance imaging)
: A procedure that uses a magnet,
radio waves
, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).
CT scan
(CAT scan)
:
		  A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles.  The pictures are made by a computer linked to an
x-ray
machine. A
dye
may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the
organs
or
tissues
show up more clearly.  This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.
Pelvic lymphadenectomy
:
			 A
surgical
procedure to remove the
lymph nodes
in the
pelvis
.  A
pathologist
views the tissue under a
microscope
to look for cancer cells.
Seminal vesicle biopsy
: The removal of
fluid
from the
seminal vesicles
(
glands
that make
semen
) using a needle.  A pathologist views the fluid under a microscope to look for cancer cells.
ProstaScint scan
: A procedure to check for cancer that has spread from the prostate to other parts of the body, such as the lymph nodes.  A very small amount of radioactive material is injected into a vein and travels through the bloodstream.  The radioactive material attaches to prostate cancer cells and is detected by a scanner. The radioactive material shows up as a bright spot on the picture in areas where there are a lot of prostate cancer cells.
There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.
Cancer can spread through
tissue
, the
lymph system
, and the
blood
:
Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.
Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the
lymph vessels
to other parts of the body.
Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the
blood vessels
to other parts of the body.
Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.
When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called
metastasis
. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the
primary tumor
) and travel through the lymph system or blood.
Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a
tumor
(
metastatic
tumor) in another part of the body.
Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.
The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if  prostate cancer spreads to the bone, the cancer cells in the bone are actually prostate cancer cells. The disease is metastatic prostate cancer, not bone cancer.
Denosumab
, a
monoclonal antibody
, may be used to
prevent
bone metastases
.
Many cancer deaths are caused when cancer moves from the original tumor and spreads to other tissues and organs. This is called metastatic cancer. This animation shows how cancer cells travel from the place in the body where they first formed to other parts of the body.
The Grade Group and PSA level are used to stage prostate cancer.
The stage of the cancer is based on the results of the staging and
diagnostic tests
, including the
prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test
and the
Grade Group
. The tissue samples removed during the
biopsy
are used to find out the Gleason score. The Gleason score ranges from 2 to 10 and describes how different the cancer cells look from normal cells under a
microscope
and how likely it is that the
tumor
will spread. The lower the number, the more cancer cells look like normal cells and are likely to grow and spread slowly.
The Grade Group depends on the Gleason score. See the
General Information
section for more information about the Gleason score.
Grade Group 1 is a Gleason score of 6 or less.
Grade Group 2 or 3 is a Gleason score of 7.
Grade Group 4 is a Gleason score 8.
Grade Group 5 is a Gleason score of 9 or 10.
The PSA test measures the level of PSA in the blood. PSA is a substance made by the prostate that may be found in an increased amount in the blood of men who have prostate cancer.
The following stages are used for prostate cancer:
Stage I
Enlarge
Stage I prostate cancer. Cancer is found in the prostate only. The cancer is not felt during a digital rectal exam and is found by needle biopsy done for high prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level or in a sample of tissue removed during surgery for other reasons.

Treatment Option Overview
Key Points
There are different types of treatment for patients with prostate cancer.
Eight types of standard treatment are used:
Watchful waiting
			 or active surveillance
Surgery
Radiation therapy and radiopharmaceutical therapy
Hormone therapy
Chemotherapy
Targeted therapy
Immunotherapy
Bisphosphonate therapy
There are treatments for bone pain caused by bone metastases or hormone therapy.
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical
		  trials.
Cryosurgery
High-intensity–focused ultrasound therapy
Proton beam radiation therapy
Photodynamic therapy
Treatment for prostate cancer may cause side effects.
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
Follow-up tests may be needed.
There are different types of treatment for patients with prostate cancer.
Different types of treatment are available for patients with
prostate cancer
. Some treatments are
standard
(the currently used treatment), and some
		  are being tested in
clinical trials
.
		   A treatment clinical trial is a
research study
meant to help
		  improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients
		  with
cancer
. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the
		  standard treatment, the new
		  treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
Eight types of standard treatment are used:
Watchful waiting
			 or active surveillance
Watchful waiting
and
active surveillance
are treatments used for older men who do not have
signs
or
symptoms
or have other medical
conditions
and for men whose prostate cancer is found during a
screening
test.
Watchful waiting is closely
monitoring
a patient’s condition without giving any treatment until signs or symptoms appear or change. Treatment is given to relieve symptoms and improve
quality of life
.
Active surveillance is closely following a patient's condition without giving any treatment unless there are changes in test results. It is used to find early signs that the condition is getting worse. In active surveillance, patients are given certain exams and tests, including
digital rectal exam
,
PSA test
,
transrectal ultrasound
, and transrectal
needle biopsy
, to check if the cancer is growing. When the cancer begins to grow, treatment is given to
cure
the cancer.
Other terms that are used to describe not giving treatment to cure prostate cancer right after
diagnosis
are observation, watch and wait, and expectant management.
Surgery
Patients in good health  whose
tumor
is in the
prostate
gland
only may be treated with
surgery
to remove the tumor. The following types of surgery are used:
Radical
				prostatectomy
: A surgical procedure to remove the prostate, surrounding
tissue
, and
seminal vesicles
. Removal of nearby
lymph nodes
may be done at the same time. The main types of radical prostatectomy include:
Open radical prostatectomy
: An
incision
(cut) is made in the retropubic area (lower
abdomen
) or the
perineum
(the area between the
anus
and
scrotum
). Surgery is performed through the incision. It is harder for the surgeon to spare the
nerves
near the prostate or to remove nearby lymph nodes with the perineum approach.
Radical laparoscopic prostatectomy
: Several small incisions (cuts) are made in the wall of the abdomen. A
laparoscope
(a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and
lens
for viewing) is inserted through one opening to guide the surgery. Surgical instruments are inserted through the other openings to do the surgery.
Robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy
: Several small cuts are made in the wall of the abdomen, as in regular laparoscopic prostatectomy. The surgeon inserts an instrument with a camera through one of the openings and surgical instruments through the other openings using robotic arms. The camera gives the surgeon a
3-dimensional
view of the prostate and surrounding structures. The surgeon uses the robotic arms to do the surgery while sitting at  a computer monitor near the operating table.
Enlarge
Two types of radical prostatectomy. In a retropubic prostatectomy,  the prostate is removed through an incision in the wall of  the abdomen.  In a perineal prostatectomy, the prostate is removed through an incision in the area between the scrotum and the anus.
Pelvic lymphadenectomy
: A surgical procedure to remove the lymph nodes in the
pelvis
.  A
pathologist
views the tissue under a
microscope
to look for cancer
cells
. If the lymph nodes contain cancer,
				the doctor will not remove the prostate and may recommend other
				treatment.
Transurethral resection of the
				prostate
(TURP): A surgical procedure to remove tissue from the prostate using a
resectoscope
(a thin, lighted tube with a cutting tool) inserted through the
urethra
.  This procedure is done to treat
benign prostatic hypertrophy
and it is sometimes done to relieve symptoms caused by a tumor before other cancer treatment is given. TURP may
				also be done in men whose tumor is in the prostate only and who cannot have a radical prostatectomy.
Enlarge
Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP).  Tissue is removed from the prostate  using a resectoscope (a thin, lighted tube with a cutting tool at the end)  inserted through the urethra. Prostate tissue that is blocking the urethra is cut away and removed through the resectoscope.
In some cases, the nerves that control penile erection can be saved with nerve-sparing surgery.  However, this may not be possible in men with
			 large tumors or tumors that are very close to the nerves.
Possible problems after prostate cancer surgery include the following:
Impotence
.
Leakage of
urine
from the
bladder
or
stool
from the
rectum
.
Shortening of the
penis
(1 to 2
centimeters
). The exact  reason for this is not known.
Inguinal
hernia
(bulging  of fat or part of the
small intestine
through  weak muscles into the
groin
). Inguinal hernia may occur more often in men treated with  radical prostatectomy than in  men who have some other types of prostate surgery,
radiation therapy
, or  prostate
biopsy
alone. It is most likely to  occur within the first 2 years after radical prostatectomy.
Radiation therapy and radiopharmaceutical therapy
Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy
x-rays
or other types of
radiation
to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing.  There are different types of radiation therapy:
External radiation therapy
uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the area of the body with cancer.
Conformal radiation
is a type of external radiation therapy that uses a computer to make a
3-dimensional
(3-D) picture of the tumor and shapes the radiation beams to fit the tumor. This allows a high dose of radiation to reach the tumor and causes less damage to nearby healthy tissue.
Hypofractionated radiation therapy
may be given because it has a more convenient treatment schedule. Hypofractionated radiation therapy is radiation treatment in which a larger than usual total
dose
of radiation is given once a day over a shorter period of time (fewer days) compared to standard radiation therapy. Hypofractionated radiation therapy may have worse
side effects
than standard radiation therapy, depending on the schedules used.
Internal radiation therapy
uses a
radioactive
substance sealed in needles,
seeds
, wires, or
catheters
that are placed directly into or near the cancer. In
early-stage
prostate cancer, the radioactive seeds are placed in the prostate  using needles that are inserted through the skin between the scrotum and rectum. The placement of the radioactive seeds in the prostate is guided by images from
transrectal ultrasound
or
computed tomography
(CT). The needles are removed after the radioactive seeds are placed in the prostate.
Radiopharmaceutical
therapy
uses a
radioactive
substance to treat cancer. Radiopharmaceutical therapy includes the following:
Alpha emitter radiation therapy
uses a radioactive substance to treat prostate cancer that has spread to the bone. A radioactive substance called
radium-223
is
injected
into a
vein
and travels through the bloodstream. The radium-223 collects in areas of bone with cancer and kills the cancer cells.
The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and
stage
of the cancer being treated. External radiation therapy, internal radiation therapy, and radiopharmaceutical therapy are used to treat prostate cancer.
Men treated with radiation therapy for prostate cancer have an increased risk of having
bladder
and/or
gastrointestinal
cancer.
Radiation therapy can cause
impotence
and
urinary
problems that may get worse with age.
Hormone therapy
Hormone therapy
is a cancer treatment that removes
hormones
or blocks their action and stops cancer cells from growing.  Hormones are substances made by
glands
in the body and circulated in the bloodstream.   In prostate cancer, male sex hormones can cause prostate cancer to grow.
Drugs
, surgery, or other hormones are used to reduce the amount of male hormones or block them from working. This is called
androgen deprivation therapy
(ADT).
Hormone therapy for prostate cancer may
			 include the following:
Abiraterone acetate
can prevent prostate cancer cells from making
androgens
.  It is used in men with
advanced
prostate cancer that has not gotten better with other hormone therapy. It is also used in men with
high-risk
prostate cancer that has improved with treatments that lower hormone levels.
Orchiectomy
is
				a surgical procedure to remove one or both
testicles
, the main source of male hormones, such as
testosterone
, to decrease
				the amount of hormone being made.
Estrogens
(hormones that promote female sex characteristics) can prevent the
				testicles from making
				testosterone. However, estrogens are seldom used today in the treatment of
				prostate cancer because of the risk of serious side effects.
Luteinizing hormone-releasing
				hormone agonists
can stop the testicles from making
				testosterone. Examples are
leuprolide
,
goserelin
, and
buserelin
.
Antiandrogens
can block the action of androgens
				(hormones that promote male sex characteristics), such as testosterone. Examples are
flutamide
,
bicalutamide
,
enzalutamide
,
apalutamide
,
nilutamide
, and
darolutamide
.
Drugs that can prevent the
adrenal glands
from making androgens include
ketoconazole
,
aminoglutethimide
,
hydrocortisone
, and
progesterone
.
Hot flashes
,
impaired
sexual function, loss of desire for sex, and weakened bones
			 may occur in men treated with hormone therapy.  Other side effects include
diarrhea
,
nausea
, and itching.
See
Drugs Approved for Prostate Cancer
for more information.
Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy
is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.  When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or
injected
into a
vein
or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (
systemic chemotherapy
).
See
Drugs Approved for Prostate Cancer
for more information.
Targeted therapy
Targeted therapy
is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells. Targeted therapies usually cause less harm to normal cells than chemotherapy or radiation therapy do.
PARP inhibitors
block an
enzyme
involved in many cell functions, including the repair of
DNA
damage. Blocking this enzyme may help keep cancer cells from repairing their damaged DNA, causing them to die.
Olaparib
is a PARP inhibitor used to treat patients with prostate cancer  that has spread to other parts of the body and has
mutations
in certain
genes
, such as
BRCA1
or
BRCA2
.
Immunotherapy
Immunotherapy
is a treatment that uses the patient’s
immune system
to fight cancer.  Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the body’s natural defenses against cancer. This cancer treatment is a type of
biologic therapy
.
Sipuleucel-T
is a type of immunotherapy used to treat prostate cancer that has
metastasized
(spread to other parts of the body).
See
Drugs Approved for Prostate Cancer
for more information.
Bisphosphonate therapy
Bisphosphonate
drugs, such as
clodronate
or
zoledronate
,  reduce bone disease when cancer has spread to the bone. Men who are treated with antiandrogen therapy or orchiectomy are at an increased risk of bone loss. In these men, bisphosphonate drugs lessen the risk of bone fracture (breaks). The use of bisphosphonate drugs to prevent or  slow the growth of bone
metastases
is being studied in clinical trials.
There are treatments for bone pain caused by bone metastases or hormone therapy.
Prostate cancer that has spread to the bone and certain types of hormone therapy can weaken bones and lead to bone pain. Treatments for bone pain include the following:
Pain
medicine
.
External radiation therapy.
Strontium-89
(a
radioisotope
).
Targeted therapy
with a
monoclonal antibody
, such as
denosumab
.
Bisphosphonate therapy.
Corticosteroids
.
See the
PDQ
summary on
Pain
for more information.
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical
		  trials.
This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the
NCI website
.
Cryosurgery
Cryosurgery
is a treatment that uses an instrument to freeze and destroy prostate cancer cells. Ultrasound is used to find the area that will be treated. This type of treatment is also called cryotherapy.
Cryosurgery can cause impotence and leakage of urine from the bladder or stool from the rectum.
High-intensity–focused ultrasound therapy
High-intensity–focused ultrasound therapy
is a treatment that uses ultrasound (high-energy sound waves) to destroy cancer cells.  To treat prostate cancer, an
endorectal
probe
is used to make the sound waves.
Proton beam radiation therapy
Proton beam radiation therapy
is a type of high-energy, external radiation therapy that uses  streams of
protons
(tiny particles with a positive charge) to kill tumor cells. This type of treatment can lower the amount of radiation damage to healthy tissue near a tumor.
Photodynamic therapy
A cancer treatment that uses a drug and a certain type of
laser
light to kill cancer cells. A drug that is not active until it is exposed to light is injected into a vein. The drug collects more in cancer cells than in normal cells.
Fiberoptic
tubes are then used to carry the laser light to the cancer cells, where the drug becomes active and kills the cells.
Photodynamic therapy
causes little damage to healthy tissue. It is used mainly to treat tumors on or just under the skin or in the lining of internal organs.
Treatment for prostate cancer may cause side effects.
For information about
side effects
caused by treatment for cancer, visit our
Side Effects
page.
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
For some patients, taking part in a
clinical trial
may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer  treatments are safe and effective or better than the
standard treatment
.
Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first  to receive a new treatment.
Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.
Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the
side effects
of cancer treatment.
Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about clinical trials supported by NCI can be found on NCI’s
clinical trials search
webpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the
ClinicalTrials.gov
website.
Follow-up tests may be needed.
As you go through treatment, you  will have follow-up tests or check-ups. Some tests that were done to
diagnose
or
stage
the cancer may be repeated to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.
Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back).

About This PDQ Summary
About PDQ
Physician Data Query (PDQ) is the National Cancer Institute's (NCI's) comprehensive cancer information database. The PDQ database contains summaries of the latest published information on cancer prevention, detection, genetics, treatment, supportive care, and complementary and alternative medicine. Most summaries come in two versions. The health professional versions have detailed information written in technical language. The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language. Both versions have cancer information that is accurate and up to date and most versions are also available in
Spanish
.
PDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal government’s center of biomedical research.  The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH.
Purpose of This Summary
This PDQ cancer information summary has current information about the treatment of prostate cancer.  It is meant to inform and help patients, families, and caregivers. It does not give formal guidelines or recommendations for making decisions about health care.
Reviewers and Updates
Editorial Boards write the PDQ cancer information summaries and keep them up to date. These Boards are made up of experts in cancer treatment and other specialties related to cancer. The summaries are reviewed regularly and changes are made when there is new information. The date on each summary ("Updated") is the date of the most recent change.
The information in this patient summary was taken from the health professional version, which is reviewed regularly and updated as needed, by the
PDQ Adult Treatment Editorial Board
.
Clinical Trial Information
A clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become "standard." Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
Clinical trials can be found online at
NCI's website
. For more information, call the
Cancer Information Service
(CIS), NCI's contact center, at 1-800-4-CANCER (1-800-422-6237).
