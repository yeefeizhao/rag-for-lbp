Summary
The bladder is a hollow organ in your lower abdomen that stores urine. Bladder cancer occurs in the lining of the bladder. It is the sixth most common type of cancer in the United States.
Symptoms include:
Blood in your urine
A frequent urge to urinate
Pain when you urinate
Low back pain
Risk factors for developing bladder cancer include smoking and exposure to certain chemicals in the workplace.  People with a family history of bladder cancer or who are older, white, or male have a higher risk.
Treatments for bladder cancer include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and biologic therapy. Biologic therapy boosts your body's own ability to fight cancer.
