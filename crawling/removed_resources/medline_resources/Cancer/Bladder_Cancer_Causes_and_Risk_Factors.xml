Bladder cancer is caused by certain changes in how
bladder
cells
function, especially how they grow and divide into new cells. There are many risk factors for bladder cancer, but many do not directly cause cancer. Instead, they increase the chance of
DNA
damage in cells that may lead to bladder cancer. To learn more about how cancer develops, see
What Is Cancer?
A risk factor is anything that increases the chance of getting a disease. Some risk factors for bladder cancer, like using tobacco, can be changed. Risk factors also include things people cannot change, like their age and family history. It’s important to learn about risk factors for bladder cancer because it can help you make choices that might lower your risk of getting it.
Risk factors  for bladder cancer
In the United States, bladder cancer occurs more often in men than in women, and more often in White individuals than in Black individuals. Bladder cancer can be diagnosed at any age, but the risk increases as a person gets older.
Using tobacco, especially smoking cigarettes, is a major  risk factor for bladder cancer. Tobacco contains harmful chemicals called carcinogens. When you use tobacco, these chemicals get absorbed into the bloodstream, are filtered by the
kidneys
, and then collect in the
urine
. This exposes your bladder to high levels of these chemicals, which can damage  the DNA in the cells lining your bladder.

Other risk factors for bladder cancer include
having a
family history
of bladder cancer
having certain changes in the
genes
that are linked to bladder cancer, such as
HRAS
,
RB1
,
PTEN
/MMAC1
,
NAT2
, and
GSTM1
being exposed to paints, dyes, metals, or petroleum products in the workplace
past treatment with
radiation therapy
to the
pelvis
or with certain
anticancer
drugs, such as
cyclophosphamide
or
ifosfamide
taking the Chinese herb
Aristolochia fangchi
drinking water from a well that has high levels of
arsenic
drinking water that has been treated with
chlorine
having a bladder
infection
caused by a
parasite
called
Schistosoma haematobium
, which is common in Africa and the Middle East but rare in the United States
using urinary
catheters
for a long time
Having one or more of these risk factors does not necessarily mean you will get bladder cancer. Many people with risk factors never develop bladder cancer, while others with no known risk factors do. Talk with your doctor if you think you might be at risk of bladder cancer. Bladder cancer
screening
options may be available to you.
