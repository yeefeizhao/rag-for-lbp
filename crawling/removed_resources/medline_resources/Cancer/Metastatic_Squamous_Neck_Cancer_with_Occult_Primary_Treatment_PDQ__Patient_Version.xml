Key Points
Metastatic squamous neck cancer with occult primary is a
		  disease in which squamous cell cancer spreads  to
		  lymph nodes in the neck and it is not known where the cancer first formed in the body.
Signs and symptoms of metastatic squamous neck cancer with occult
		  primary include a lump or pain in the neck or throat.
Tests that examine the tissues of the neck, respiratory tract,  and upper part of the digestive tract are used
		  to detect (find) and diagnose metastatic squamous neck cancer and the 
		  primary tumor.
Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.
Metastatic squamous neck cancer with occult primary is a
		  disease in which squamous cell cancer spreads  to
		  lymph nodes in the neck and it is not known where the cancer first formed in the body.
Squamous cells are thin, flat cells found in tissues that form the surface of the skin and  the lining of body cavities such as the mouth,  hollow organs such as the
uterus
and
blood vessels
, and the lining of the
respiratory
(breathing) and
digestive tracts
. Some organs with squamous cells are the
esophagus
,
lungs
,
kidneys
, and uterus.
Cancer
can begin in squamous cells anywhere in the
		  body and
metastasize
(spread) through the blood or
lymph system
to other parts of the body.
When
squamous cell cancer
spreads to
lymph nodes
in the neck or around the
collarbone
, it is called
metastatic
squamous neck cancer. The doctor will try to find the
primary tumor
(the cancer that first formed in the body), because
		  treatment for metastatic cancer is the same as treatment for the
		  primary tumor.
		  For example, when
lung cancer
spreads to the neck, the cancer cells in the neck are lung cancer cells and they are
		  treated the same as the cancer in the lung. Sometimes doctors cannot find where in the body the cancer first began to grow.  When tests cannot find a primary tumor,  it is called an
occult (hidden) primary tumor
. In many cases, the primary tumor is never found.
Signs and symptoms of metastatic squamous neck cancer with occult
		  primary include a lump or pain in the neck or throat.
Check with your doctor if you have a lump or pain in your neck or
throat
that doesn't go away. These and other
signs
and
symptoms
may be caused by
		  metastatic squamous neck cancer with occult primary. Other conditions may cause the same signs and symptoms.
Tests that examine the tissues of the neck, respiratory tract,  and upper part of the digestive tract are used
		  to detect (find) and diagnose metastatic squamous neck cancer and the 
		  primary tumor.
Tests will include checking for a primary tumor in the organs and tissues of the respiratory tract (part of the
trachea
), the upper part of the digestive tract (including the lips, mouth, tongue, nose, throat,
vocal cords
, and part of the esophagus), and the
genitourinary system
. In addition to asking about your
personal
and
family health history
and doing a
physical exam
, your doctor may perform the following tests and procedures:
Biopsy
: The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a
microscope
by a
pathologist
or tested in the laboratory to check for signs of cancer.
Three types of  biopsy may be done:
Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy
: The removal of  tissue or
fluid
using a thin needle.
Core needle biopsy
: The removal of tissue using a wide needle.
Excisional biopsy
: The removal of an entire lump of tissue.
The following procedures are used to remove samples of cells or tissue:
Tonsillectomy
: Surgery to remove both
tonsils
.
Endoscopy
: A procedure to look at organs and tissues inside the body to check for
abnormal
areas.  An
endoscope
is inserted through an
incision
(cut) in the skin or opening in the body, such as the mouth or nose.  An endoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a
lens
for viewing. It may also have a tool to remove abnormal tissue or lymph node samples, which are checked under a microscope for signs of disease. The nose, throat, back of the tongue, esophagus, stomach,
voice box
,
windpipe
, and large airways will be checked.
One or more of the following
laboratory tests
may be done to study the tissue samples:
Immunohistochemistry
: A laboratory test that uses
antibodies
to check for certain
antigens
(
markers
) in a sample of a patient’s blood or
bone marrow
. The antibodies are usually linked to an
enzyme
or a fluorescent dye. After the antibodies bind to a specific antigen in the blood or bone marrow, the enzyme or dye is activated, and the antigen can then be seen under a microscope. This type of test is used to help
diagnose
cancer and to help tell one type of cancer from another type of cancer.
Light
and
electron microscopy
: A test in which cells in a sample of tissue are viewed under regular and high-powered microscopes to look for certain changes in the cells.
Epstein-Barr virus
(EBV) and
human papillomavirus
(HPV) test
: A test that checks the cells in a sample of tissue for EBV and HPV
DNA
.
MRI
(magnetic resonance imaging)
: A procedure that uses a magnet,
radio waves
, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).
CT scan
(CAT scan)
: A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles.  The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A
dye
may be
injected
into a
vein
or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly.  This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.
Enlarge
Computed tomography (CT) scan of the head and neck. The patient lies on a table that slides through the CT scanner, which takes x-ray pictures of the inside of the head and neck.
PET scan
(positron emission tomography scan)
: A procedure to find
malignant
tumor
cells in the body.  A small amount of radioactive
glucose
(sugar) is injected into a vein.  The PET
scanner
rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body.  Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do. A whole body PET scan and a CT scan are done at the same time to look for where the cancer first formed. If there is any cancer, this increases the chance that it will be found.
A diagnosis of occult primary tumor is made if the primary tumor is not found during testing or treatment.
Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.
The
prognosis
and treatment options depend on the following:
The number and size of  lymph nodes that have cancer in them.
Whether the cancer has
responded
to treatment or has
recurred
(come back).
How different from normal the cancer cells look under a microscope.
The patient's age and general health.
Treatment options also depend on the following:
Which part of the neck the cancer is in.
Whether certain tumor markers are found.
Stages of Metastatic Squamous Neck Cancer with Occult
Primary
Key Points
After metastatic squamous neck cancer with occult primary has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread to other parts of the body.
There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.
Metastatic squamous neck cancer with occult primary can recur (come back) after it has been treated.
After metastatic squamous neck cancer with occult primary has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread to other parts of the body.
The process used to find out if cancer has spread  to other parts of the body is called
staging
. There is no standard
staging
		  system
for
metastatic
squamous
neck cancer with
occult primary
. Depending on whether the cancer was caused by
human papillomavirus 16
or
Epstein-Barr virus
, oropharyngeal or nasopharyngeal cancer staging may be used.  For more information, see the section called
Stage Information for Metastatic Squamous Neck Cancer with Occult Primary
in the health professional version of this page.
The results from
tests and procedures
used to detect and
diagnose
the
primary tumor
are also used to find out if cancer has spread to other parts of the body.
There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.
Cancer can spread through
tissue
, the
lymph system
, and the
blood
:
Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.
Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the
lymph vessels
to other parts of the body.
Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the
blood vessels
to other parts of the body.
Metastatic squamous neck cancer with occult primary can recur (come back) after it has been treated.
The cancer may come back in the neck or in other parts of the body.
Treatment Option Overview
Key Points
There are different types of treatment for patients with
		  metastatic squamous neck cancer with occult primary.
The following types of treatment are used:
Surgery
Radiation therapy
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
Chemotherapy
Hyperfractionated radiation therapy
Treatment for metastatic squamous neck cancer with occult
		primary may cause side effects.
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
Follow-up tests may be needed.
There are different types of treatment for patients with
		  metastatic squamous neck cancer with occult primary.
Different types of treatment are available for patients with
metastatic
squamous
neck
cancer
with
occult primary
. Some treatments are
standard
(the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in
clinical trials
.  A
		  treatment clinical trial is a
research study
meant to help improve current
		  treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer.
		  When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the
		  standard treatment, the new
		  treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
The following types of treatment are used:
Surgery
Surgery may include
neck dissection
. There are different types of neck dissection, based on the amount of tissue that is removed.
Radical neck dissection: Surgery to remove tissues in one or both sides of the neck between the jawbone and the
collarbone
, including the following:
All
lymph nodes
.
The jugular
vein
.
Muscles and
nerves
that are used for face, neck, and shoulder movement, speech, and swallowing.
The patient may need
physical therapy
of the throat, neck, shoulder, and/or arm after radical neck dissection. Radical neck dissection may be used when cancer has spread widely in the neck.
Modified radical neck dissection: Surgery to remove all the lymph nodes in one or both sides of the neck without removing  the neck muscles. The nerves and/or the jugular vein may be removed.
Partial neck dissection: Surgery to remove some of the lymph nodes in the neck. 

This is also called  selective neck dissection.
After the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the
			 time of surgery, some patients may be given
radiation therapy
after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left. Treatment
			 given after surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called
adjuvant
			 therapy
.
Radiation therapy
Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy
x-rays
or other types of
radiation
to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing.
External radiation therapy
uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the area of the body with cancer.
Intensity-modulated radiation therapy
(IMRT) is a type of
3-dimensional
(3-D) external radiation therapy that uses a computer to make pictures of the size and shape of the
tumor
. Thin beams of radiation of different intensities (strengths) are aimed at the tumor from many angles. This type of radiation therapy  is less likely to cause dry mouth, trouble swallowing, and  damage to the skin.
Enlarge
External-beam radiation therapy of the head and neck. A machine is used to aim high-energy radiation at the cancer. The machine can rotate around the patient, delivering radiation from many different angles to provide highly conformal treatment. A mesh mask helps keep the patient’s head and neck from moving during treatment. Small ink marks are put on the mask. The ink marks are used to line up the radiation machine in the same position before each treatment.
Radiation therapy to the neck may change the way the
thyroid gland
works.
Blood tests
may be done to check the
thyroid hormone
level in the body
			 before treatment and at regular checkups after treatment.
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the
NCI website
.
Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy
is a cancer treatment that uses
drugs
to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or
injected
into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (
systemic chemotherapy
).
Hyperfractionated radiation therapy
Hyperfractionated radiation therapy
is a type of external radiation treatment in which a smaller than usual total daily
dose
of radiation is divided into two doses and the treatments are given twice a day.  Hyperfractionated radiation therapy is given over the same period of time (days or weeks) as standard radiation therapy.
Treatment for metastatic squamous neck cancer with occult
		primary may cause side effects.
For information about
side effects
caused by treatment for cancer, visit our
Side Effects
page.
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
For some patients, taking part in a
clinical trial
may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer  treatments are safe and effective or better than the
standard treatment
.
Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first  to receive a new treatment.
Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.
Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the
side effects
of cancer treatment.
Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about clinical trials supported by NCI can be found on NCI’s
clinical trials search
webpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the
ClinicalTrials.gov
website.
Follow-up tests may be needed.
As you go through treatment, you  will have follow-up tests or check-ups. Some tests that were done to
diagnose
or
stage
the cancer may be repeated to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.
Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back).
Treatment of Untreated Metastatic Squamous Neck Cancer with Occult Primary
Untreated metastatic squamous neck cancer with occult primary means that a patient is newly diagnosed and has not been treated, except to relieve
signs
and
symptoms
caused by the cancer. For information about the treatments listed below, see the
Treatment Option Overview
section.
Treatment of untreated
metastatic
squamous neck cancer with
occult primary
may include the following:
Radiation therapy
.
Surgery.
Radiation therapy followed by surgery.
A
clinical trial
of
chemotherapy
followed by radiation
			 therapy.
A clinical trial of chemotherapy given at the same time as
hyperfractionated radiation therapy
.

About This PDQ Summary
About PDQ
Physician Data Query (PDQ) is the National Cancer Institute's (NCI's) comprehensive cancer information database. The PDQ database contains summaries of the latest published information on cancer prevention, detection, genetics, treatment, supportive care, and complementary and alternative medicine. Most summaries come in two versions. The health professional versions have detailed information written in technical language. The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language. Both versions have cancer information that is accurate and up to date and most versions are also available in
Spanish
.
PDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal government’s center of biomedical research.  The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH.
Purpose of This Summary
This PDQ cancer information summary has current information about the treatment of metastatic squamous neck cancer with occult primary.  It is meant to inform and help patients, families, and caregivers. It does not give formal guidelines or recommendations for making decisions about health care.
Reviewers and Updates
Editorial Boards write the PDQ cancer information summaries and keep them up to date. These Boards are made up of experts in cancer treatment and other specialties related to cancer. The summaries are reviewed regularly and changes are made when there is new information. The date on each summary ("Updated") is the date of the most recent change.
The information in this patient summary was taken from the health professional version, which is reviewed regularly and updated as needed, by the
PDQ Adult Treatment Editorial Board

Clinical Trial Information
A clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become "standard." Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
Clinical trials can be found online at
NCI's website

		  treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer.
		  When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the
		  standard treatment, the new
		  treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
The following types of treatment are used:
Surgery
Surgery may include
neck dissection
. There are different types of neck dissection, based on the amount of tissue that is removed.
Radical neck dissection: Surgery to remove tissues in one or both sides of the neck between the jawbone and the
collarbone
, including the following:
All
lymph nodes
.
The jugular
vein
.
Muscles and
nerves
that are used for face, neck, and shoulder movement, speech, and swallowing.
The patient may need
physical therapy
of the throat, neck, shoulder, and/or arm after radical neck dissection. Radical neck dissection may be used when cancer has spread widely in the neck.
Modified radical neck dissection: Surgery to remove all the lymph nodes in one or both sides of the neck without removing  the neck muscles. The nerves and/or the jugular vein may be removed.
Partial neck dissection: Surgery to remove some of the lymph nodes in the neck. 

This is also called  selective neck dissection.
After the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the
			 time of surgery, some patients may be given
radiation therapy
after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left. Treatment
			 given after surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called
adjuvant
			 therapy
.
Radiation therapy
Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy
x-rays
or other types of
radiation
to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing.
External radiation therapy
uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the area of the body with cancer.
Intensity-modulated radiation therapy
(IMRT) is a type of
3-dimensional
(3-D) external radiation therapy that uses a computer to make pictures of the size and shape of the
tumor
. Thin beams of radiation of different intensities (strengths) are aimed at the tumor from many angles. This type of radiation therapy  is less likely to cause dry mouth, trouble swallowing, and  damage to the skin.
Enlarge
External-beam radiation therapy of the head and neck. A machine is used to aim high-energy radiation at the cancer. The machine can rotate around the patient, delivering radiation from many different angles to provide highly conformal treatment. A mesh mask helps keep the patient’s head and neck from moving during treatment. Small ink marks are put on the mask. The ink marks are used to line up the radiation machine in the same position before each treatment.
Radiation therapy to the neck may change the way the
thyroid gland
works.
Blood tests
may be done to check the
thyroid hormone
level in the body
			 before treatment and at regular checkups after treatment.
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the
NCI website
.
Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy
is a cancer treatment that uses
drugs
to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or
injected
into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (
systemic chemotherapy
).
Hyperfractionated radiation therapy
Hyperfractionated radiation therapy
is a type of external radiation treatment in which a smaller than usual total daily
dose
of radiation is divided into two doses and the treatments are given twice a day.  Hyperfractionated radiation therapy is given over the same period of time (days or weeks) as standard radiation therapy.
Treatment for metastatic squamous neck cancer with occult
		primary may cause side effects.
For information about
side effects
caused by treatment for cancer, visit our
Side Effects
page.
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
For some patients, taking part in a
clinical trial
may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer  treatments are safe and effective or better than the
standard treatment
.
Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first  to receive a new treatment.
Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.
Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the
side effects
of cancer treatment.
Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about clinical trials supported by NCI can be found on NCI’s
clinical trials search
webpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the
ClinicalTrials.gov
website.
Follow-up tests may be needed.
As you go through treatment, you  will have follow-up tests or check-ups. Some tests that were done to
diagnose
or
stage
the cancer may be repeated to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.
Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back).

Metastatic Squamous Neck Cancer with Occult Primary Treatment (PDQ®)–Patient Version
General Information About Metastatic Squamous Neck Cancer with Occult Primary
Go to Health Professional Version
Key Points
Metastatic squamous neck cancer with occult primary is a
		  disease in which squamous cell cancer spreads  to
		  lymph nodes in the neck and it is not known where the cancer first formed in the body.
Signs and symptoms of metastatic squamous neck cancer with occult
		  primary include a lump or pain in the neck or throat.
Tests that examine the tissues of the neck, respiratory tract,  and upper part of the digestive tract are used
		  to detect (find) and diagnose metastatic squamous neck cancer and the 
		  primary tumor.
Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.
Metastatic squamous neck cancer with occult primary is a
		  disease in which squamous cell cancer spreads  to
		  lymph nodes in the neck and it is not known where the cancer first formed in the body.
Squamous cells are thin, flat cells found in tissues that form the surface of the skin and  the lining of body cavities such as the mouth,  hollow organs such as the
uterus
and
blood vessels
, and the lining of the
respiratory
(breathing) and
digestive tracts
. Some organs with squamous cells are the
esophagus
,
lungs
,
kidneys
, and uterus.
Cancer
can begin in squamous cells anywhere in the
		  body and
metastasize
(spread) through the blood or
lymph system
to other parts of the body.
When
squamous cell cancer
spreads to
lymph nodes
in the neck or around the
collarbone
, it is called
metastatic
squamous neck cancer. The doctor will try to find the
primary tumor
(the cancer that first formed in the body), because
		  treatment for metastatic cancer is the same as treatment for the
		  primary tumor.
		  For example, when
lung cancer
spreads to the neck, the cancer cells in the neck are lung cancer cells and they are
		  treated the same as the cancer in the lung. Sometimes doctors cannot find where in the body the cancer first began to grow.  When tests cannot find a primary tumor,  it is called an
occult (hidden) primary tumor
. In many cases, the primary tumor is never found.
Signs and symptoms of metastatic squamous neck cancer with occult
		  primary include a lump or pain in the neck or throat.
Check with your doctor if you have a lump or pain in your neck or
throat
that doesn't go away. These and other
signs
and
symptoms
may be caused by
		  metastatic squamous neck cancer with occult primary. Other conditions may cause the same signs and symptoms.
Tests that examine the tissues of the neck, respiratory tract,  and upper part of the digestive tract are used
		  to detect (find) and diagnose metastatic squamous neck cancer and the 
		  primary tumor.
Tests will include checking for a primary tumor in the organs and tissues of the respiratory tract (part of the
trachea
), the upper part of the digestive tract (including the lips, mouth, tongue, nose, throat,
vocal cords
, and part of the esophagus), and the
genitourinary system
. In addition to asking about your
personal
and
family health history
and doing a
physical exam
, your doctor may perform the following tests and procedures:
Biopsy
: The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a
microscope
by a
pathologist
or tested in the laboratory to check for signs of cancer.
Three types of  biopsy may be done:
Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy
: The removal of  tissue or
fluid
using a thin needle.
Core needle biopsy
: The removal of tissue using a wide needle.
Excisional biopsy
: The removal of an entire lump of tissue.
The following procedures are used to remove samples of cells or tissue:
Tonsillectomy
: Surgery to remove both
tonsils
.
Endoscopy
: A procedure to look at organs and tissues inside the body to check for
abnormal
areas.  An
endoscope
is inserted through an
incision
(cut) in the skin or opening in the body, such as the mouth or nose.  An endoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a
lens
for viewing. It may also have a tool to remove abnormal tissue or lymph node samples, which are checked under a microscope for signs of disease. The nose, throat, back of the tongue, esophagus, stomach,
voice box
,
windpipe
, and large airways will be checked.
One or more of the following
laboratory tests
may be done to study the tissue samples:
Immunohistochemistry
: A laboratory test that uses
antibodies
to check for certain
antigens
(
markers
) in a sample of a patient’s blood or
bone marrow
. The antibodies are usually linked to an
enzyme
or a fluorescent dye. After the antibodies bind to a specific antigen in the blood or bone marrow, the enzyme or dye is activated, and the antigen can then be seen under a microscope. This type of test is used to help
diagnose
cancer and to help tell one type of cancer from another type of cancer.
Light
and
electron microscopy
: A test in which cells in a sample of tissue are viewed under regular and high-powered microscopes to look for certain changes in the cells.
Epstein-Barr virus
(EBV) and
human papillomavirus
(HPV) test
: A test that checks the cells in a sample of tissue for EBV and HPV
DNA
.
MRI
(magnetic resonance imaging)
: A procedure that uses a magnet,
radio waves
, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).
CT scan
(CAT scan)
: A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles.  The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A
dye
may be
injected
into a
vein
or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly.  This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.
Enlarge
Computed tomography (CT) scan of the head and neck. The patient lies on a table that slides through the CT scanner, which takes x-ray pictures of the inside of the head and neck.
PET scan
(positron emission tomography scan)
: A procedure to find
malignant
tumor
cells in the body.  A small amount of radioactive
glucose
(sugar) is injected into a vein.  The PET
scanner
rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body.  Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do. A whole body PET scan and a CT scan are done at the same time to look for where the cancer first formed. If there is any cancer, this increases the chance that it will be found.
A diagnosis of occult primary tumor is made if the primary tumor is not found during testing or treatment.
Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.
The
prognosis
and treatment options depend on the following:
The number and size of  lymph nodes that have cancer in them.
Whether the cancer has
responded
to treatment or has
recurred
(come back).
How different from normal the cancer cells look under a microscope.
The patient's age and general health.
Treatment options also depend on the following:
Which part of the neck the cancer is in.
Whether certain tumor markers are found.
Stages of Metastatic Squamous Neck Cancer with Occult
Primary
Key Points
After metastatic squamous neck cancer with occult primary has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread to other parts of the body.
There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.
Metastatic squamous neck cancer with occult primary can recur (come back) after it has been treated.
After metastatic squamous neck cancer with occult primary has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread to other parts of the body.
The process used to find out if cancer has spread  to other parts of the body is called
staging
. There is no standard
staging
		  system
for
metastatic
squamous
neck cancer with
occult primary
. Depending on whether the cancer was caused by
human papillomavirus 16
or
Epstein-Barr virus
, oropharyngeal or nasopharyngeal cancer staging may be used.  For more information, see the section called
Stage Information for Metastatic Squamous Neck Cancer with Occult Primary
in the health professional version of this page.
The results from
tests and procedures
used to detect and
diagnose
the
primary tumor
are also used to find out if cancer has spread to other parts of the body.
There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.
Cancer can spread through
tissue
, the
lymph system
, and the
blood
:
Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.
Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the
lymph vessels
to other parts of the body.
Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the
blood vessels
to other parts of the body.
Metastatic squamous neck cancer with occult primary can recur (come back) after it has been treated.
The cancer may come back in the neck or in other parts of the body.

Different types of treatment are available for patients with
metastatic
squamous
neck
cancer
with
occult primary
. Some treatments are
standard
(the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in
clinical trials
.  A
		  treatment clinical trial is a
research study
meant to help improve current
		  treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer.
		  When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the
		  standard treatment, the new
		  treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
The following types of treatment are used:
