Cryotherapy uses very cold temperatures to freeze and kill
prostate cancer
cells. The goal of cryosurgery is to destroy the entire prostate gland and possibly surrounding tissue.
Cryosurgery is generally not used as a first treatment for prostate cancer.
What Happens During Cryotherapy
Before the procedure, you will be given medicine so that you do not feel pain. You may receive:
A sedative to make you drowsy and numbing medicine on your perineum. This is the area between the anus and scrotum.
Anesthesia. With
spinal anesthesia
, you will be drowsy but awake, and numb below the waist. With
general anesthesia
, you will be asleep and pain-free.
First, you will get a urinary
catheter
that will stay in place for about 3 weeks after the procedure.
During the procedure, the surgeon places needles through the skin of the perineum into the prostate.
Ultrasound is used to guide the needles to the prostate gland.
Then, very cold gas passes through the needles, creating ice balls that destroy the prostate gland tissue.
Warm salt water will flow through the catheter to keep your urethra (the tube from the bladder to outside the body) from freezing.
Cryosurgery is most often a 2-hour outpatient procedure. Some people may need to stay in the hospital overnight.
When Cryosurgery is Used to Treat Prostate Cancer
This therapy is not as commonly used and is not as well accepted as other treatments for prostate cancer. Doctors do not know for certain how well cryosurgery works over time. There is not enough data to compare it with standard
prostatectomy
,
radiation treatment
, or
brachytherapy
.
It can only treat prostate cancer that has not spread beyond the prostate. Men who cannot have surgery because of their age or other health problems may have cryosurgery instead. It also may be used if cancer comes back after other treatments.
It is generally not helpful for men with very large prostate glands.
Side Effects
Possible short-term side effects of cryotherapy for prostate cancer include:
Blood in the urine
Trouble passing urine
Swelling of the penis or scrotum
Problems controlling your urination
(more likely if you have had radiation therapy also)
Possible long-term problems include:
Erection problems
in nearly all men
Damage to the rectum
A tube that forms between the rectum and the bladder, called a fistula (this is very rare)
Problems with passing urine or controlling urination
Scarring of the urethra and difficulty urinating
Alternative Names
Cryosurgery - prostate cancer; Cryoablation - prostate cancer
