When you first learn that you have bladder cancer, you may wonder how you’re going to cope with the upcoming changes in your life. One step you can take is to be informed of the physical and emotional changes that may occur and what resources are available to help you. Talking with your health care team about your concerns can give you a greater sense of control. Family and friends  can also be  important sources of support.

Adjusting after urostomy
For those who have  a
stoma
and
urostomy
bag, getting used to them takes time. Some people need to learn how to use a
catheter
to empty their bladder, which is another big change. And if you have incontinence or problems controlling your bladder, it can be frustrating to deal with.
Know that you aren't alone in how you feel. Adjusting to these changes can be hard. But, over time, many people are able to do a lot of what they did before surgery.  Support from family members and your health care team can help you get used to life after urostomy surgery. Ask your nurse for resources and support groups that may be helpful. Learn more about

Self-image and sexual problems
Body changes may affect your self-image and sex life after treatment. Some treatments for bladder cancer, including
chemotherapy
,
radiation therapy
, surgery, or certain medicines, can cause short-term or long-term problems with sex. For example, having a
cystectomy
may affect the nerves and make it harder for men to have an erection. Women may have pain during sex or problems with lubrication and orgasm.
It’s important to discuss any issues and concerns you have about sex with your health care team before treatment. Knowing your thoughts ahead of time may help them plan your treatment.

The stress of follow-up care
It’s common for bladder cancer to come back, even after successful treatment. As a result, it is important for people who have been treated for bladder cancer to visit their doctor regularly to get certain follow-up exams or tests. This can be hard for a number of reasons, such as:
Planning and scheduling these appointments can be stressful and time-consuming.
Waiting for test results can cause
anxiety
and an ongoing fear of recurrence.
The added costs of things such as copays, medicines, and parking and transportation fees only add to the stress.
