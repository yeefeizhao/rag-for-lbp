Control medicines for
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
are drugs you take to control or prevent symptoms of COPD. You must use these medicines every day for them to work well.
These medicines are not used to treat
flare-ups
. Flare-ups are treated with
quick-relief (rescue) drugs
.
Depending on the medicine, control drugs help you breathe easier by:
Relaxing the muscles in your airways
Reducing any swelling in your airways
Helping the lungs work better
You and your health care provider can make a plan for the control drugs that you should use. This plan will include when you should take them and how much you should take.
You may need to take these drugs for at least a month before you start to feel better. Take them even when you feel OK.
Ask your provider about the side effects of any medicines you are prescribed. Be sure you know which side effects are serious enough that you need to call your provider right away.
Follow instructions on how to use your medicines the right way.
Make sure you get your medicine refilled before you run out.
