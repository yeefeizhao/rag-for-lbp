www.thoracic. orgCLIP AND COPYWhat is chronic bronchitis?
Obstructive bronchiolitis is a condition in which chronic 
inflammation and swelling cause the inside of the breathing tubes 
(airways) to be smaller than normal. This narrowing interferes 
with how well and how easily air empties out of the lungs 
(expiration).  
What is emphysema?
The lungs are made up of more than 300 million tiny air sacs called 
alveoli. These air sacs are normally stretchy and springy. When 
you breathe in, the airs sacs expand like tiny balloons. Breathing 
out usually is passive (takes no effort) as the alveoli “spring” back 
to their original size. In emphysema, the walls of the air sacs 
(alveoli) of the lung are damaged and lose their stretchiness. As a 
result, they do not empty easily. Emphysema can also contribute 
to narrowing of the airways.
The combination of non-stretchy alveoli due to emphysema and 
narrowed airways due to both chronic bronchitis and emphysema, 
prevents the lungs from emptying normally. This causes air to 
become trapped in the lungs. “Air trapping” or the inability to fully 
exhale, leads to abnormal expansion or hyperinflation (hi-per-in-
flay-shun) of the lungs. Constantly having trapped air in the lungs 
combined with the extra effort needed to breathe results in a 
person feeling short of breath. What causes COPD?
Although the most common cause of COPD is tobacco smoke, 
there are several other factors that can cause or make COPD 
worse, including environmental exposures and genetic (inherited) 
risk. For example, heavy exposure to certain dusts at work, 
chemicals, and indoor or outdoor air pollution (including wood 
smoke or biomass fuels) can contribute to COPD. Some people 
have none of these exposures and still get COPD. We don’t fully 
understand why some smokers never develop COPD and some Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a preventable 
and treatable lung disease. People with COPD must work harder to 
breathe, which can lead to shortness of breath and/or feeling tired. 
Early in the disease, people with COPD may feel short of breath when 
they exercise. As the disease progresses, it can be hard to  breathe 
out (exhale) or even breathe in (inhale). A person with COPD may 
have chronic bronchitis (bron-ki-tis), emphysema, or a combination of 
both conditions. The amount of each of these conditions differs from 
person to person. Asthma is another disease that causes narrowing 
of the airways, making it hard to breathe at times, but asthma is not 
included in the definition of COPD. Some people do have a mix of both 
COPD and asthma.

probably play a role in who develops COPD.
How do I know if I have COPD?
Common symptoms of COPD include feeling short of breath while 
resting or when doing physical activity, cough, wheezing, fatigue, 
and/or mucus production that does not go away. If you have 
these symptoms, you should talk to your healthcare provider. 
Some people with early COPD may not be aware of symptoms. 
Testing should be done in people who are at risk for COPD. Your 
healthcare provider may have you do a breathing test (lung 
function test) called spirometry. Spirometry measures your ability 
to exhale and can detect whether your airways are narrowed. 
(See ATS Patient Information Series fact sheets on Pulmonary 
Function Testing).
How does a healthcare provider know  
a person has COPD?
Healthcare providers diagnose COPD based upon the 
combination of symptoms and test results. The single most 
important test to determine if a person has COPD is spirometry. 
Changes of COPD can also be seen on a chest x-ray or a chest CT 
scan. Once your healthcare provider has determined that you 
have COPD, he or she may order other tests to assess how well 
you are breathing with sleep and with exercise. This includes 
looking at your oxygen saturation levels.
How is COPD treated?
The first and most important treatment of COPD in smokers is to 
stop smoking. Medications and other therapies are available to 
help treat nicotine addiction and to help you stop smoking. For 
more help on stopping smoking, see the ATS Patient information 
Series fact sheets on Tobacco.
Medications can also be prescribed to help relieve symptoms 
of COPD and to prevent symptom flares (called exacerbations) 
that can lead to further loss of lung function. Some general 
classes of medications include those that aim to widen the 
airways (bronchodilators), reduce swelling in the airways (anti-
inflammatory drugs, such as steroids), and/or treat infections 
(antibiotics). Other than antibiotics, most COPD medications 
should be taken every day, usually for life. Stay as healthy as 
possible. Avoid contact with those who are sick, wash hands 
often, get a yearly flu vaccine, and get pneumonia and COVID-19 
vaccines when recommended by your healthcare provider.
In some people, COPD can also cause the oxygen level in the 
blood to be low. If this occurs, a person can be given supplemental 
oxygen. Breathlessness should not be confused with low oxygen 
levels. People with COPD can experience shortness of breath or 
have a hard time breathing even if they have good oxygen levels. 
Therefore, breathlessness is not always a good guide for whether 
you need to use oxygen (See ATS Patient Information Series fact 
sheet on Breathlessness).
Proper nutrition and staying in good physical shape are also 
important not just for symptom relief but also for your quality of 
life. Pulmonary rehabilitation programs offer supervised exercise 
and education for those with breathing problems and should 
be a part of a comprehensive treatment plan for anyone with 
COPD. Community support groups can provide education and 
opportunities for COPD patients and their caregivers to share 
their experience with other people with COPD and families. (See ATS Patient Information Series fact sheet on Pulmonary 
Rehabilitation).
In some cases, surgical procedures such as lung volume reduction 
surgery or lung transplantation may be options to consider (See 
ATS Patient Information Series fact sheets on Surgery for COPD 
and Lung Transplantation). 
Will COPD ever go away?
The term chronic, in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 
means that it lasts for a long time. Symptoms of COPD 
sometimes improve when a person stops smoking, takes 
medication regularly, and/or attends pulmonary rehabilitation. 
However, the lungs are still damaged and can never fully return to 
normal. Therefore, COPD is a lifelong condition. Breathlessness 
and fatigue may never go away entirely, but people can learn to 
manage their condition and continue to lead a fulfilling life.
