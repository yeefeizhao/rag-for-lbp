Postural drainage is one way to help treat breathing problems due to swelling and too much mucus in the airways of the lungs.
Follow your health care provider's instructions on how to do postural drainage at home. Use the information below as a reminder.
What to Expect at Home
With postural drainage, you get into a position that helps drain fluid out of the lungs. It may help:
Treat or prevent an infection
Make breathing easier
Prevent more problems with the lungs
A respiratory therapist, nurse, or doctor will show you the best position for postural drainage.
How to Do Postural Drainage
The best time to do postural drainage is either before a meal or an hour and a half after a meal, when your stomach is emptiest.
Use one of the following positions:
Sitting
Lying on your back, stomach, or side
Sitting or lying with your head flat, up, or down
Stay in the position for as long as your provider instructed (at least 5 minutes). Wear comfortable clothes and use pillows to get as comfortable as possible. Repeat the position as often as instructed.
Breathe in slowly through your nose, and then out through your mouth. Breathing out should take about twice as long as breathing in.
Percussion or Vibration
Your doctor may also recommend doing percussion or vibration.
Percussion helps break up thick fluids in the lungs. Either you or someone else claps a hand on your ribs while you are lying down. You can do this with or without clothing on your chest:
Form a cup shape with your hand and wrist.
Clap your hand and wrist against your chest (or have someone clap your back, if your doctor tells you to).
You should hear a hollow or popping sound, not a slapping sound.
Do not clap so hard that it hurts.
Vibration is like percussion, but with a flat hand that gently shakes your ribs.
Take a deep breath, then blow out hard.
With a flat hand, gently shake your ribs.
You may use a specially designed vest to provide the vibration.
Your provider will show you how to do this the right way.
Do percussion or vibration for 5 to 7 minutes in each area of the chest. Do this on all of the areas of your chest or back that your doctor tells you to. When you finish, take a deep breath and cough. This helps bring up any phlegm, which you can then spit out.
When to Call the Doctor
Call your doctor if you have:
Indigestion
Vomiting
Pain
Severe discomfort
Difficulty breathing
