KNOW IT’S COPD,
HERE’S HOW TO BREATHE BETTER.
You have taken the important step of being aware of your 
symptoms, and seeing your doctor or health care provider for testing and a diagnosis. While COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease) is a serious lung disease that worsens over time, your provider can suggest treatment options and ways to help you manage COPD. Here are some things you can do now 
to breathe better and improve your quality of life.
1) 
QUIT SMOKING.
If y
ou smoke, quitting is the best thing you can do to prevent 
more damage to your lungs. Ask your provider about new 
options for quitting. Many resources to help are available online. Visit smokefree.gov; lungusa.org; or call 1-800-QUIT NOW for more information.
2) 
A
VOID EXPOSURE TO POLLUTANTS.
T
ry to stay away from other things that could irritate your lungs, 
like dust and strong fumes. Stay indoors when the outside air 
quality is poor, and avoid places where there might be cigarette smoke.
3)  
VISIT YOUR PRO VIDER REGULARLY.
See your doctor or health care provider on a regular basis. Bring 
a list of all medications you are taking to each office visit. If your current symptoms worsen, or if you have new ones, be sure to tell your doctor.IT’S SERIOUS, BUT
YOU’RE NOT 
ALONE.
COPD—also known as emphysema 
or chronic bronchitis—is a serious disease that partially blocks the airways, or tubes, that carry air in and out of the lungs. It worsens over time, making it harder to breathe.
COPD is a leading cause of 
death in the United States. There are currently more than 16 million people who have been diagnosed and several additional millions likely have it, but don’t know it.
With proper diagnosis and 
increasingly better treatments for COPD, there is reason for hope. Be sure to follow your provider’s recommendations so you can manage your COPD, breathe better and have a better quality of life.

 4) FOLLOW TREATMENT ADVICE.
Take your medications exactly as prescribed. And follow your 
pr
ovider’s advice on how to treat your COPD.
5) TAKE PRECAUTIONS AGAINST THE FLU.
It can cause serious problems for people with COPD. So, 
do your best to avoid crowds during flu season. Consider getting a flu shot every year. And ask your provider about the pneumonia vaccine.
6) 
 SEEK SUPPORT FROM OTHERS WHO HAVE COPD .
See if your local hospital has a COPD support group. You 
can also find a very active COPD community online. Family members can be supportive, too, as you learn to live with and manage your COPD.Talking with your 
doctor is good for your breathing.
To get the best treatment for your 
COPD, it’s important that you speak honestly with your doctor or health care provider at each visit. Let them know what’s really going on with your breathing. Don’t hesitate to ask questions about your disease, symptoms and treatment options. Read our Patient Tips factsheet for help on getting the most from each visit.
HOW DOES COPD 
AFFECT BREATHING?
When lungs are healthy, the airways and 
air sacs have an elastic, flexible quality. They expand to fill with air and then bounce back to their original shape when air is exhaled. This elasticity helps to retain the normal lung structure and also helps the air to move quickly in and out.
In people with COPD, the air sacs no 
longer bounce back to their original shape, and the airways can become swollen or thicker than normal. COPD can also cause increased mucus production. The airways can become partially blocked, making it even harder to get air in and out of the lungs.NORMAL LUNG

 DIAGNOSIS AND 
TREATMENT OF COPD
IT STARTS WITH A TEST 
CALLED SPIROMETRY
It’s one of the best and most common ways to 
help diagnose COPD. Using a machine called a spirometer, this noninvasive breathing test measures the amount of air a person can blow out of the lungs (volume) and how fast (flow). The results help your doctor assess how well your lungs are working and the best course of treatment.
Next, your doctor may suggest one of more of 
these treatment options:
MEDICATIONS
Two of the most common are bronchodilators 
and inhaled steroids, but your provider may recommend other types of medications for your COPD. Bronchodilators usually come in an inhaler and work to relax and open up the muscles around your airways, making it easier to breathe. Inhaled steroids help prevent the airways from getting inflamed.
PULMONARY REHABILITATION
This is a program that helps you learn to exercise 
and manage your disease with physical activity and counseling. It can help you stay active and carry out your day-to-day tasks.
PHYSICAL ACTIVITY TRAINING
Your provider, or a pulmonary therapist your 
doctor recommends, may teach you some activities to help your arms and legs get stronger and/or breathing exercises that strengthen the muscles needed for breathing.OXYGEN TREATMENT
If your COPD is severe, your doctor might 
suggest that you breathe oxygen some or all of the time to help with shortness of breath. 
SURGERY
In some severe cases of COPD, providers may 
suggest lung surgery to improve breathing and alleviate some symptoms.
WHAT TO DO IF YOUR 
SYMPTOMS SUDDENLY WORSEN
Symptoms of COPD can get worse all of a 
sudden. When this happens, it is much harder 
to catch your breath. You might also have...
• 
Chest tightness.
• More coughing.
• A change in your cough (becomes more
productive; more mucus is expelled).
• A fever.
There could be many causes for symptoms getting worse, such as a lung infection or heart disease related to severe lung damage. The best thing to do is call your health care provider right away.

medical emergency, and have it all together in an easy-to-grab place. Things like:
• A list of all medications you are taking for COPD and  
other conditions.
• Contact information for your doctor or health care 
provider, including name, office address, office and 
emergency phone numbers.
