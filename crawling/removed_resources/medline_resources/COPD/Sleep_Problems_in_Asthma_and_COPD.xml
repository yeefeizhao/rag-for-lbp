I get with asthma and/or COPD?
Waking up at night, also called nighttime 
arousals or nighttime awakenings, can happen 
if you have asthma or COPD. These arousals 
interrupt your sleep and may result in feeling 
groggy in the morning and/or tired during the 
day. Symptoms of COPD and asthma that may 
cause you to wake up at night include coughing, 
wheezing, breathlessness, nasal congestion and 
heartburn. People with COPD and/or asthma 
may also be at increased risk for obstructive 
sleep apnea (OSA) and may awaken from 
symptoms of this sleep problem.
What is sleep apnea and why can I get sleep 
apnea with asthma and/or COPD?
Sleep apnea is a condition that causes you 
to snore and have periods when you stop 
breathing during sleep. These pauses in 
breathing usually last 10 seconds or longer. 
(See ATS fact sheet on OSA in Adults.) It is 
not clear why sleep apnea may occur more 
often in  people with asthma and/or COPD, 
but you are more at risk if you have severe 
asthma, are overweight, have nasal congestion, acid reflux and/or use high doses of inhaled 
corticosteroids. 
How do sleep problems affect my asthma and/
or COPD?
People with asthma and/or COPD who have a 
frequent problem waking up at night often have 
worse respiratory disease. They are also at risk 
for complications from their asthma or COPD. 
Sleep apnea can worsen asthma symptoms 
throughout the day, increase your need for 
rescue inhalers, and worsen your quality of life. 
If you have COPD, the pauses in your breathing 
and low oxygen levels with sleep apnea can 
make your COPD worse, increase your risk for 
exacerbations, and reduce your survival. Sleep 
apnea can be a serious condition by itself. 
People who have moderate to severe sleep 
apnea that is not treated are at higher risk for 
hypertension, heart disease, and stroke (See 
ATS fact sheet on OSA and Heart Disease).
What can I do to help myself sleep better?
The first step is to make sure that your 
asthma and/or COPD is under good control. 
Talk to your healthcare provider to review 
your disease control, see that you are getting Sleep Problems in Asthma and COPD

People with asthma and/or Chronic 
Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) may 
have sleep issues that can lead to nighttime 
awakenings and daytime sleepiness.  This 
may worsen their symptoms of asthma or 
COPD. There are a number of steps people 
with asthma and/or COPD can take to 
improve their sleep. NORMAL AIRW AY

www.thoracic.orgthe right medical treatment, and make a 
plan of things you can do to control your 
asthma/COPD. Your healthcare provider will 
instruct you when to use your rescue inhaler 
(such as albuterol or levalbuterol) and how 
to use breathing techniques like pursed lip 
breathing should you experience any sudden 
breathlessness. Also, talk to your healthcare 
provider if you have problems with regular 
nasal congestion or heartburn, to get them 
under better control. If you smoke, quitting 
smoking will not only help your asthma or 
COPD control, but also improve the quality of 
your sleep. 
Tell your health care provider if you think 
you may have sleep apnea so that you can 
be evaluated. Sleep apnea is a treatable 
condition!
