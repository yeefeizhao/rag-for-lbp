Summary
What is COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)?
COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) is a group of lung diseases that make it hard to breathe and get worse over time.
Normally, the airways and air sacs in your lungs are elastic or stretchy. When you breathe in, the airways bring air to the air sacs. The air sacs fill up with air, like a small balloon. When you breathe out, the air sacs deflate, and the air goes out. If you have COPD, less air flows in and out of your airways because of one or more problems:
The airways and air sacs in your lungs become less elastic
The walls between many of the air sacs are destroyed
The walls of the airways become thick and inflamed
The airways make more mucus than usual and can become clogged
What are the types of COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)?
COPD includes two main types:
Emphysema
affects the air sacs in your lungs, as well as the walls between them. They become damaged and are less elastic.
Chronic bronchitis
, in which the lining of your airways is constantly irritated and inflamed. This causes the lining to swell and make mucus.
Most people with COPD have both emphysema and chronic bronchitis, but how severe each type is can be different from person to person.
What causes COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)?
The cause of COPD is usually long-term exposure to irritants that damage your lungs and airways. In the United States,
cigarette smoke
is the main cause. Pipe, cigar, and other types of tobacco smoke can also cause COPD, especially if you inhale them.
Exposure to other inhaled irritants can contribute to COPD. These include
secondhand smoke
,
air pollution
, and chemical fumes or dusts from the environment or workplace.
Rarely, a genetic condition called
alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency
can play a role in causing COPD.
Who is at risk for COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)?
The risk factors for COPD include:
Smoking.
This the main risk factor. Up to 75% of people who have COPD smoke or used to smoke.
Long-term exposure to other lung irritants
, such as secondhand smoke, air pollution, and chemical fumes and dusts from the environment or workplace
Age.
Most people who have COPD are at least 40 years old when their symptoms begin.
Genetics.
This includes alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, which is a genetic condition. Also, smokers who get COPD are more likely to get it if they have a family history of COPD.
Asthma.
People who have
asthma
have more risk of developing COPD than people who don't have asthma. But most people with asthma will
not
get COPD.
What are the symptoms of COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)?
At first, you may have no symptoms or only mild symptoms. As the disease gets worse, your symptoms usually become more severe. They can include:
Frequent
coughing
or a cough that produces a lot mucus
Wheezing
A whistling or squeaky sound when you breathe
Shortness of breath, especially with physical activity
Tightness in your chest
Some people with COPD get frequent respiratory infections such as
colds
and the
flu
. In severe cases, COPD can cause weight loss, weakness in your lower muscles, and
swelling
in your ankles, feet, or legs.
How is COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) diagnosed?
Your health care provider may use many tools to make a diagnosis:
A medical history, which includes asking about your symptoms
A family history
Various tests, such as
lung function tests
, a chest
x-ray
or
CT scan
, and blood tests
Your doctor will diagnose COPD based on your signs and symptoms, your medical and family histories, and test results.
What are the treatments for COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)?
There is no cure for COPD. However, treatments can help with symptoms, slow the progress of the disease, and improve your ability to stay active. There are also treatments to prevent or treat complications of the disease. Treatments include:
Lifestyle changes
, such as
Quitting smoking
if you are a smoker. This is the most important step you can take to treat COPD.
Avoiding secondhand smoke and places where you might breathe in other lung irritants
Ask your health care provider for an eating plan that will meet your nutritional needs. Also ask about how much physical activity you can do. Physical activity can strengthen the muscles that help you breathe and improve your overall wellness.
Medicines
, such as
Bronchodilators, which relax the muscles around your airways. This helps open your airways and makes breathing easier. Most bronchodilators are taken through an inhaler. In more severe cases, the inhaler may also contain
steroids
to reduce inflammation.
Vaccines for the
flu
and pneumococcal pneumonia, since people with COPD are at higher risk for serious problems from these diseases
Antibiotics
if you get a bacterial or viral lung infection
Oxygen therapy
, if you have severe COPD and low levels of oxygen in your blood. Oxygen therapy can help you breathe better. You may need extra oxygen all the time or only at certain times.
Pulmonary rehabilitation
, which is a program that helps improve the well-being of people who have chronic breathing problems. It may include
An exercise program
Disease management training
Nutritional counseling
Psychological counseling
Surgery
, usually as a last resort for people who have severe symptoms that have not gotten better with medicines:
For COPD that is mainly related to emphysema, there are surgeries that
Remove damaged lung tissue
Remove large air spaces (bullae) that can form when air sacs are destroyed. The bullae can interfere with breathing.
For severe COPD, some people may need
lung transplant
If you have COPD, it's important to know when and where to get help for your symptoms. You should get emergency care if you have severe symptoms, such as trouble catching your breath or talking. Call your health care provider if your symptoms are getting worse or if you have signs of an infection, such as a
fever
.
Can COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) be prevented?
Since smoking causes most cases of COPD, the best way to prevent it is to not smoke. It's also important to try to avoid lung irritants such as secondhand smoke, air pollution, chemical fumes, and dusts.
