Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common lung disease. Having COPD makes it hard to breathe.
There are two main forms of COPD:
Chronic bronchitis, which involves a long-term cough with mucus
Emphysema, which involves damage to the lungs over time
Most people with COPD have a combination of both conditions.
Causes
Smoking is the main cause of COPD. The more a person smokes, the more likely that person will develop COPD. But some people smoke for years and never get COPD.
If a person has a rare condition in which they lack a protein called
alpha-1 antitrypsin
, they can develop emphysema even without smoking.
Other risk factors for COPD are:
Exposure to certain gases or fumes in the workplace
Exposure to heavy amounts of secondhand smoke and pollution
Frequent use of a cooking fire without proper ventilation
Symptoms
Symptoms may include any of the following:
Cough
, with or without mucus
Fatigue
Frequent respiratory infections
Shortness of breath (
dyspnea
) that gets worse with mild activity
Trouble catching one's breath
Wheezing
Because the symptoms develop slowly, many people may not know that they have COPD.
Exams and Tests
The best test for COPD is a lung function test called
spirometry
. This involves blowing out as hard as possible into a small machine that tests air movement and lung capacity. The results can be checked right away.
Using a stethoscope to listen to the lungs can also be helpful, showing prolonged expiratory time or wheezing. But sometimes, the lungs sound normal, even when a person has COPD.
Imaging tests of the lungs, such as
x-rays
and
CT scans
may be ordered. With an x-ray, the lungs may look normal, even when a person has COPD. A CT scan will almost always show signs of COPD if it is present.
Sometimes, a blood test called
arterial blood gas
may be done to measure the amounts of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the blood.
If your health care provider suspects you have alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, a
blood test
will likely be ordered to detect this condition.
Treatment
There is no cure for COPD. But there are many things you can do to relieve symptoms and keep the disease from getting worse.
If you smoke,
now is the time to quit
. This is the best way to slow lung damage.
Medicines used to treat COPD include:
Quick-relief drugs
to help open the airways
Control drugs
to reduce lung inflammation
Anti-inflammatory drugs to reduce swelling in the airways
Certain long-term antibiotics
In severe cases or during flare-ups, you may need to receive:
Steroids by mouth or through a vein (intravenously)
Bronchodilators through a nebulizer
Oxygen therapy
Assistance from a
machine
to help breathing by using a mask or through the use of an endotracheal tube
Your provider may prescribe antibiotics during symptom
flare-ups
, because an infection can make COPD worse.
You may need
oxygen therapy
at home if you have a low level of oxygen in your blood.
Pulmonary rehabilitation does not cure COPD. But it can teach you more about the disease, train you to breathe in a different way so you can stay active and feel better, and keep you functioning at the highest level possible.
LIVING WITH COPD
You
can do things every day
to keep COPD from getting worse, protect your lungs, and stay healthy.
Walk to build up strength:
Ask the provider or respiratory therapist how far to walk.
Slowly increase how far you walk.
Avoid talking if you get short of breath when you walk.
Use pursed lip breathing when you breathe out, to empty your lungs before the next breath.
Things you can do to make it easier for yourself around the home include:
Avoid very cold air or very hot weather
Make sure no one smokes in your home
Reduce air pollution by not using the fireplace and getting rid of other irritants
Manage stress and your mood
Use oxygen if prescribed for you
Eat healthy foods, including fish, poultry, and lean meat, as well as fruits and vegetables. If it is hard to keep your weight up, talk to a provider or dietitian about eating foods with more calories, by eating small frequent meals.
Surgery or other interventions may be used to treat COPD. Only a few people benefit from these surgical treatments:
One-way valves can be inserted with a bronchoscopy to help deflate parts of the lung that are hyperinflated (overinflated) in select patients.
Surgery to remove parts of the diseased lung, which can help less-diseased parts work better in some people with emphysema (lung volume reduction surgery).
Lung transplant
for a small number of very severe cases.
Support Groups
You can ease the stress of illness by joining a
support group
. Sharing with others who have common experiences and problems can help you not feel alone.
Outlook (Prognosis)
COPD is a long-term (chronic) illness. The disease will get worse more quickly if you do not stop smoking.
If you have severe COPD, you will be short of breath with most activities. You may be admitted to the hospital more often.
Talk with your provider about breathing machines and end-of-life care as the disease progresses.
Possible Complications
With COPD, you may have
other health problems
such as:
Irregular heartbeat (
arrhythmia
)
Need for breathing machine support with a mask (non-invasive ventilation) and oxygen therapy
Right-sided heart failure or
cor pulmonale
(heart swelling and
heart failure
due to chronic lung disease)
Pneumonia
Collapsed lung (
pneumothorax
)
Severe weight loss and
malnutrition
Thinning of the bones (
osteoporosis
)
Debilitation
Increased anxiety
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Go to the emergency room or call 911 or the local emergency number if you have a rapid increase in shortness of breath.
Prevention
Not smoking prevents most cases of COPD. Ask your provider about
quit-smoking
programs. Medicines are also available to help you stop smoking.
