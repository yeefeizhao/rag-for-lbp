Bronchodilators are medications that relax the muscles that wrap 
around your breathing tubes (airways), allowing the tubes to 
become larger and easier to breathe through. Each bronchodilator 
is different, based on its: 1) chemical make-up, 2) how fast it works, and 3) how long it lasts. Your healthcare provider will decide with you which of these medications or combinations work best for you.
Types of bronchodilators:
	■beta2-agonists
	■anticholinergics
	■theophyllines
Beta2-Agonists
Inhaled beta2-agonists can be fast-acting (start to work within 3 to 5 minutes) or slow-acting (take 20 minutes to work). Fast-acting 
beta2-agonists are known as rescue or reliever medicines because 
they bring quick relief for breathlessness, but do not last long enough to provide 24-hour relief. Using your reliever medication 
before an activity that you know makes your breathing worse (such 
as exercise, showering, or going out into the cold air) may help 
lessen or prevent your breathing difficulty.
Inhaled beta2-agonists are short-lasting (last 4 to 6 hours) or 
long-lasting (last 12 to 24 hours). Examples of short-lasting beta2-
agonists are albuterol, levalbuterol, pirbuterol, salbutamol, and terbutaline. Examples of long-lasting beta2-agonists are salmeterol, formoterol, indacaterol, and vilanterol. Long-lasting beta2-
agonists are taken every 12 to 24 hours, providing more convenient 
treatment of COPD than short-acting drugs that are usually used as “rescue medications” to relieve sudden onset of shortness of breath.
Albuterol and terbutaline are also available in a pill form, but the pill 
forms can cause more side effects than the inhaled form and take longer to start working so their use has been discouraged.
Common side effects when taking beta2-agonists
Beta2-agonists are generally safe medications when inhaled but can 
cause a fast heartbeat, tremors (shakiness), and rarely cramping 
of the hands, legs, and feet, particularly if they are used too often 
or too many puffs are inhaled at once. These medications may also 
keep you awake at night. The combination of a fast heartbeat and 
shakiness can cause feelings of anxiety and worsen breathlessness. These side eff ects often last for only a few minutes after taking the 
medicine and may totally go away after a few days of regular use. 
If the side effects do not go away, talk to your healthcare provider. 
You may need to try a lower dose, change to another type or brand 
of beta2-agonist, or stop the beta2-agonist. If you have difficulty 
going to sleep after taking your beta2-agonist, take it an hour or 
two before bedtime.
Anticholinergics
Anticholinergic bronchodilators are also inhaled medicine s. They have 
a slower onset of action than beta2-agonists and, therefore, they  
should never be used for quick reli ef. Anticholinergics can be short- or 
long-lasting. The short -lasting form (i pratropium) works in about 15 
minutes, lasts for 6–8 hours, and is usually taken up to 4 times a day. 
The long-lasting forms take about 20 minutes to begin working and 
lasts for 12 hours (aclidinium) or 24 hours (tiotropium, umeclidinium). 
Common side effects when taking anticholinergics 
Anticholinergic bronchodilators do not have as many possible side 
effects as beta2-agonists. The most common side effects are dry 
mouth and rarely, difficulty passing urine (urinary retention).
Why am I taking two inhaled bronchodilators if they both do the 
same thing?
It may be confusing to understand why you are taking two different 
bronchodilators. Research studies have shown that combinations 
of two bronchodilators work better than either alone. A common 
combination is to give a long-acting beta2-agonist and a long acting 
anticholinergic. 
Theophylline
Theophylline is a bronchodilator that is not commonly used 
for COPD in the U.S. since most people can use inhaled 
bronchodilators. It is usually taken by mouth as a pill. A blood test 
must be done to monitor your theophylline level to make sure the 
drug level is high enough to be effective, but not high enough to 
cause serious side effects. The amount of theophylline that you take 
needs careful supervision since your theophylline blood level can 
change when you start a new medicine, stop smoking, or change 
your diet. A common side effect is shakiness, but very serious side 
effects include severe nausea, vomiting, heart beat irregularities, 
and seizures. If you experience any of these, get medical care right 
away immediately.Medicines for COPD
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic disease of 
the lungs that damages both the airways and the lung tissue, making 
it difficult to breathe. A person with COPD may have chronic bronchitis 
(bron-ki-tis), emphysema, or a combination of both conditions. People with COPD often use several kinds of medicines to help control 
symptoms. While there is no cure, medicines can help improve your 
quality of life. This fact sheet explains different types of medicines 
used for COPD. For more information on COPD, see the ATS Patient 
Information Series at www.thoracic.org/patients .

Steroids, also known as corticosteroids, are medications used to 
reduce swelling in the breathing tubes. These drugs are not the 
same as anabolic steroids (misused by athletes) to build muscles.
Steroids are usually taken by inhaler, often in combination with a 
bronchodilator. They do not work quickly and may take a week or 
more before you notice the benefits. If you have an exacerbation 
or worsening of your COPD symptoms, steroids may be given by 
mouth in a pill form because pills can act faster (within 24 hours) 
and provide a higher dose of steroids than the inhaled forms. Using 
oral steroids for a long period of time (chronically) is discouraged 
due to significant side effects.
Common side effects when taking steroid medications 
Side effects depend upon the dose, length of use, and whether 
taken by pill or inhaled form. 
The most common side effects of inhaled steroids are a sore throat, 
hoarse voice, and infections in the throat and mouth. Things you 
can do to avoid or reduce these side effects include: 
	■Rinsing your mouth and gargling after taking an inhaled steroid 
	■Using a spacer/holding chamber to reduce the amount of steroid 
landing in your mouth and throat 
People with COPD who use inhaled steroids, especially those with 
severe disease and who at an advanced age, may have a higher risk 
of pneumonia. 
Taking steroids by pill, either in high doses or low doses for a long 
time, may cause problems including bruising of the skin, weight gain, 
weakening of the skin and bones (osteoporosis), cataracts, high blood 
pressure, increased blood sugar, mood changes, muscle weakness, 
and swelling of the ankles or feet. Many but not all of these side 
effects may improve or go away when the oral steroid is stopped. 
While many of these unwanted effects can be troublesome, not 
taking steroids when they are needed can lead to severe, life-
threatening breathing problems. You should discuss any concerns 
about taking steroids with your healthcare provider.
OTHER MEDICATIONS
For people who have frequent COPD exacerbations despite being 
on bronchodilators and inhaled steroids, two medications are 
sometimes used—roflumilast and long-term use of the antibiotic, 
azithromycin. Both are taken by mouth as pills and have been 
shown to decrease the number of exacerbations you have. 
However, both can have side effects, so it is important to discuss the 
risks and benefits with your healthcare provider. 
In addition, other antibiotics are used if a bacterial infection is 
suspected to cause a COPD exacerbation. Mucolytic medications 
may be used as-needed to thin mucus (phlegm or sputum) making 
it easier to cough up. Some people need to use oxygen to treat low 
oxygen levels (See ATS Patient Information Series fact sheet on 
Oxygen Therapy).
What is the Difference Between a Generic and Brand Name 
Medicine?
Most medicines have two names, a generic and a brand name. The 
generic name describes the main chemical in the drug. The brand 
name is decided by the maker (or makers) of the medicine. If several 
companies make the same generic drug, then the drug may be 
known by several brand names. Names may vary by country. Usually 
there is no major difference between brands of the same medicine 
in how it works. Your healthcare provider can tell you if there are any 
important differences to know in choosing a brand of medicine.Delivery Devices for Inhaled Medicines
Bronchodilators and steroids are usually taken by inhaling the 
medicine. Some of these inhaled medicines are available in a dry 
powder form as well as liquid spray (mist). There are different 
designs for inhalers depending on the form and drug. Two or three 
medications may be combined into a single inhaler. If you do not use 
your inhalers correctly, you may not get the full dose of the medicine. 
You can inhale some medicines better by using the metered dose 
inhaler with a spacer (holding chamber). A spacer is a tube that 
attaches to the inhaler device to hold a dose and give you more 
time to breathe it in deeply. Bring your inhalers and spacer to your 
healthcare provider visit and review your medicines and how you use 
them with him or her. The clinic staff (nurses or respiratory therapists) 
may also be helpful in showing you how to take an inhaled medication.
