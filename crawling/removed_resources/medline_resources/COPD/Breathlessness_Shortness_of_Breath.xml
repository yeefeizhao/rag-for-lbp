Many things can cause breathlessness, including: 
	■Chronic lung disease (chronic means that you have it all 
the time)
	■A sudden lung problem (called an acute problem) like an 
infection, such as pneumonia or COVID-19
	■A flare-up of chronic lung disease due to infection
	■Inhaling dust, chemicals, or other hazards in the air 
outside or inside your home
	■Heart conditions such as a “heart attack” or heart failure
	■Lung cancer or chemotherapy for other cancers
	■Anemia (low red blood cell count)
	■Low fitness level (being ‘out of shape’)
Shortness of breath may come on with activities you know 
will cause a problem, such as taking a walk or climbing 
stairs. Sometimes it may seem like it comes on for no 
reason all.
Tell your healthcare provider about your breathing problem 
and how it is affecting your life. Be sure to include:
	■When the shortness of breath started (for example, 
suddenly, two days ago) 
	■What (if anything) makes your breathing better (for 
example, using your albuterol inhaler) or makes it worse 
(for example, showering or walking across a room) 
	■If you usually bring up mucus, are you bringing up more 
or less than usual? Has the color or thickness changed? 
Does it have a bad odor?
What can I do to treat or reduce breathlessness?
Often there are things you can do to limit or control 
shortness of breath. The first step is to figure out what is causing the problem. Work with your healthcare provider 
to find out what is causing it and what the best treatment 
may be. Many times, you will have to try many different 
treatments before you find one that helps you.
Below are some things that may help your shortness of 
breath. 
1. Take your medications as prescribed. You may need to 
take some medicines every day, even if your breathing 
is good. This may be the main reason many people have 
shortness of breath.
2. Ask a respiratory healthcare professional to show you 
how to use your inhaler(s) and/or nebulizer. Ask about 
using a holding chamber with your inhaler to get as 
much medicine as possible into your lungs. Tell your 
healthcare provider about any problems you experience 
from your medicines. 
3. Oxygen is a medicine and may help people with low 
oxygen levels breathe easier. Oxygen is not for people 
who are short of breath from other conditions.
4. Learn breathing techniques. There are special ways 
you can breathe that may help when you are short of 
breath. For example, if you have chronic obstructive 
lung disease (COPD), you may be taught pursed-lip 
breathing. This will help you breathe more effectively. 
Pursed lip breathing helps remind you to slow down 
your breathing and take longer to exhale than inhale. 
5. Even if you have shortness of breath with just a little 
activity, it is possible to get back some strength and 
endurance/stamina. You may have given up or avoided 
activities because of your lung problems, but if you 
do not exercise, your muscles will get even weaker. 
Being ‘out of shape’ can result in even more breathing Breathlessness–Shortness of Breath
Having trouble breathing can be scary. When you are 
having a hard time breathing, or feel like you cannot get 
enough air, what does it feel like? Some people would say 
‘I am breathless’ or ‘short of breath’. A medical term for 
breathlessness is dyspnea (pronounced disp-nee-uh). 
If you find it hard to breathe, tell your healthcare provider. 
They can help find out why you’re short of breath and talk 
with you about treatments that work for you.

www.thoracic.orgproblems. Ask your healthcare provider to refer you to 
a pulmonary rehabilitation program. These programs 
are designed especially for people with chronic lung 
disease. The trained staff can help you exercise safely 
by carefully supervising you and you will learn how 
better manage your chronic lung disease. 
 If pulmonary rehabilitation is not available in your area 
or you are unable to go, ask your healthcare provider 
to refer you to a physical therapist. A therapist will 
talk with you about your activity and observe how you 
move. You will then get an exercise program that fits 
your needs and limitations. It is important to exercise at 
a level that is safe for you. 
6. Pace yourself. If you are rushing around doing chores 
or activities, you need to slow down. You can pace 
yourself by walking more slowly instead of rushing and 
stopping. You can do this by breaking big chores into 
small parts. If you feel “strongest” and less short of 
breath in the mornings, do your harder activities then. 
7. Find out if your body weight is right for you. If you 
are overweight, your belly could be pushing up on 
your lungs. If you are underweight, you may be losing 
muscle. A registered dietician can help by making food 
suggestions that are best for you. If you have trouble 
eating, prepare foods that are easy to chew. Holding 
your breath while you chew food may make you more 
short of breath.
8. Try not to hold your breath. Breath holding can become 
a habit when you are lifting or reaching for something, 
or even getting out of a chair. Inhale, then exhale 
(breathe out) when you are doing the hardest part of an 
activity like pushing open a door or bending over. Also, 
try to breathe out two times longer than you breathe 
in, but never force the air out. Use pursed-lips breathing 
and let the air ‘roll’ out of your lungs. When you walk, 
try breathing in when you take one step and breathe 
out as you take two to three steps. This may cause 
you to walk more slowly, but you may be able to walk 
further without stopping. 
9. Use a fan. You may find that a fan blowing on your face 
will ease your shortness of breath. Use a fan when you 
feel short of breath or “closed in” along with doing 
pursed-lips breathing can help. 
10. Ask your healthcare provider about medications to 
help decrease your shortness of breath. Sometimes a 
medicine used to treat anxiety or reduce pain can help 
decrease shortness of breath.
