You were in the hospital to treat breathing problems that are caused by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
COPD
. COPD damages your lungs. This makes it hard to breathe and get enough oxygen.
After you go home, follow instructions on taking care of yourself. Use the information below as a reminder.
When You're in the Hospital
In the hospital you received oxygen to help you breathe better. You may also need to use oxygen at home. Your health care provider may have changed some of your COPD medicines during your hospital stay.
Keep Active
To build strength:
Walk until it is a little hard to breathe.
Slowly increase how far you walk.
Try not to talk when you walk.
Ask your provider how far to walk.
Ride a stationary bike. Ask your provider how long and how hard to ride.
Build your strength even when you are sitting.
Use small weights or an exercise band to strengthen your arms and shoulders.
Stand up and sit down several times.
Hold your legs straight out in front of you, then put them down. Repeat this movement several times.
Ask your provider whether you need to use oxygen during your activities, and if so, how much. You may be told to keep your oxygen above 90%. You can measure this with an oximeter. This is a small device that measures your body's oxygen level. Talk with your provider about how much oxygen is safe to use and what oxygen saturation to aim for.
Talk to your provider about whether you should do an exercise and conditioning program such as pulmonary rehabilitation.
Self-care
Know how and when to take your COPD medicines.
Take your
quick-relief inhaler
when you feel short of breath and need help fast.
Take your
long-term drugs
every day.
Eat smaller meals more often, such as 6 smaller meals a day. It might be easier to breathe when your stomach is not full. Do not drink a lot of liquid before eating, or with your meals.
Ask your provider what foods to eat to get more energy.
Keep your lungs from becoming more damaged.
If you smoke, now is the time to quit.
Stay away from smokers when you are out, and do not allow smoking in your home.
Stay away from strong odors and fumes.
Do breathing exercises.
Talk to your provider if you feel depressed or anxious.
Stay Away From Infections
Having COPD makes it easier for you to get infections. Get a
flu shot
every year. Ask your provider if you should get a
pneumococcal (pneumonia) vaccine
and a
COVID vaccine
.
Wash your hands often. Always wash after you go to the bathroom and when you are around people who are sick.
Stay away from crowds. Ask visitors who have colds to wear masks or to visit when they're all better.
Save Your Energy at Home
Place items you use often in spots where you do not have to reach or bend over to get them.
Use a cart with wheels to move things around the house and kitchen. Use an electric can opener, dishwasher, and other things that will make your chores easier to do. Use cooking tools (knives, peelers, and pans) that are not heavy.
To save energy:
Use slow, steady motions when you are doing things.
Sit down if you can when you are cooking, eating, dressing, and bathing.
Minimize going up and down the stairs.
Get help for harder tasks.
Do not try to do too much in one day.
Keep the phone with you or near you.
After bathing, wrap yourself in a towel rather than drying off.
Try to reduce stress in your life.
Going Home With Oxygen
Never change how much oxygen is flowing in your
oxygen setup
without asking your provider.
Always have a back-up supply of oxygen in the home or with you when you go out. Keep the phone number of your oxygen supplier with you at all times. Learn
how to use oxygen safely at home
.
Follow-up
Your hospital provider may ask you to make a follow-up visit with:
Your primary care doctor
A respiratory therapist, who can teach you breathing exercises and how to use your oxygen
Your lung doctor (pulmonologist)
Someone who can help you stop smoking, if you smoke
A physical therapist, if you join a pulmonary rehabilitation program
When to Call the Doctor
Call your provider if your breathing is:
Getting harder
Faster than before
Shallow, and you cannot get a deep breath
Also call your provider if:
You need to lean forward when sitting in order to breathe easily
It is difficult to speak even a few words without being short of breath
You are using muscles around your ribs to help you breathe
You are having headaches more often
You feel sleepy or confused
You have a fever
You are coughing up dark mucus
Your fingertips or the skin around your fingernails are blue
