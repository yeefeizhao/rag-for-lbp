If you have
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD), you are more likely to have other health problems, too. These are called comorbidities. People with COPD tend to have more health problems than people who do not have COPD.
Information
Having other health problems can affect your symptoms and treatments. You may need to visit your doctor more often. You also may need to have more tests or treatments.
Having COPD is a lot to manage. But try to stay positive. You can protect your health by understanding why you are at risk for certain conditions and learning how to prevent them.
Other Health Problems you may Have
If you have COPD, you are more likely to have:
Repeat infections, such as bronchitis or
pneumonia
. COPD increases your risk for complications from colds and the flu. It increases your risk of needing to be hospitalized due to a lung infection.
High blood pressure in the lungs. COPD may cause high blood pressure in the arteries that bring blood to your lungs. This is called
pulmonary hypertension
.
Heart disease. COPD increases your risk for
heart attack
,
heart failure
, chest pain,
irregular heartbeat
, and blood clots.
Diabetes
. Having COPD increases your risk of developing diabetes. Also, some COPD medicines can cause high blood sugar.
Osteoporosis
(weak bones). People with COPD often have low levels of vitamin D, are inactive, and smoke. These factors increase your risk for bone loss and weak bones. Certain COPD medicines also may cause bone loss if taken often or for a long time.
Depression and anxiety
. It is common for people with COPD to feel depressed or anxious. Being breathless can cause anxiety. Plus, having symptoms slows you down so you can't do as much as you used to.
Heartburn
and
gastroesophageal reflux disease
(GERD). GERD and heartburn can lead to more COPD symptoms and
flare-ups.
Lung cancer. Continuing to smoke increases this risk. COPD can make it harder to treat lung cancer.
Many factors play a role in why people with COPD often have other health problems. Smoking is one of the biggest culprits. Smoking is a risk factor for most of the problems above.
COPD usually develops in middle age. And people tend to have more health problems as they age.
COPD makes it hard to breathe, which can make it hard to get enough exercise. Being inactive can lead to bone and muscle loss and increase your risk for other health problems.
Certain COPD medicines can increase your risk for other conditions such as bone loss, heart conditions, diabetes, and high blood pressure.
Staying Healthy With COPD
Work closely with your doctor to keep COPD and other medical problems under control. Taking the following steps can also help protect your health:
Take medicines and treatments as directed.
If you smoke, quit. Also avoid secondhand smoke. Avoiding smoke is the best way to slow down damage to your lungs. Ask your doctor about stop-smoking programs and other options, such as nicotine replacement therapy and tobacco cessation medicines.
Discuss the risks and side effects of your medicines with your doctor. There may be better options available or things you can do to reduce or offset the potential harms. Tell your doctor if you notice any side effects.
Have the
COVID-19 vaccines
, yearly
flu vaccine
, and the
pneumococcal vaccines
(also called "pneumonia vaccines") to help guard against infections. Wash your hands often. Stay away from people with colds or other infections.
Stay as active as possible. Try short walks and light weight training. Talk with your doctor about ways to get exercise.
Eat a healthy diet rich in lean proteins, fish, whole grains, fruits, and vegetables. Eating several small healthy meals a day can give you the nutrients you need without feeling bloated. An overfull belly can make it hard to breathe.
Check with your doctor if you
feel sad, helpless, or worried
. There are programs, treatments, and medicines that can help you feel more positive and hopeful and reduce your symptoms of anxiety or depression.
Remember that you are not alone. Your doctor will work with you to help you stay as healthy and active as possible.
When to Call the Doctor
You should contact your doctor when:
You have new signs or symptoms that concern you.
You are having trouble managing one or more of your health conditions.
You have concerns about your health problems and treatments.
You feel hopeless, sad, or anxious.
You notice medicine side effects that bother you.
