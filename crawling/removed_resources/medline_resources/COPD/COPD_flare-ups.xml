Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD) symptoms can worsen rapidly. You may find it hard to breathe. You may cough or wheeze more or produce more phlegm. You might also feel anxious and have trouble sleeping or doing your daily activities. This problem is called a COPD exacerbation or COPD flare-up.
Causes
Certain illnesses, colds, and lung infections from viruses or bacteria can lead to flare-ups. Other causes may include:
Being around smoke or other pollutants
Weather changes
Doing too much activity
Being run-down
Feeling stressed or anxious
You can often manage a flare-up right away with medicines and self-care. Work with your health care provider on an action plan for COPD exacerbations so that you know what to do.
Get to know your usual COPD symptoms, sleep patterns, and when you have good or bad days. This can help you learn the difference between your normal COPD symptoms and signs of a flare-up.
Warning Signs of a COPD Flare-up
Signs and symptoms of a COPD flare-up last 2 days or more and are more intense than your usual symptoms. The symptoms get worse and just don't go away. If you have a full-blown exacerbation, you may need to go to the hospital.
Common early signs include:
Trouble catching your breath
Noisy, wheezing breathing sounds
Coughing, sometimes with more mucus than usual or a change in the color of your mucus
Other possible signs of flare-up include:
Not being able to take deep breaths
Difficulty sleeping
Morning headaches
Abdominal pain
Anxiety
Swelling of the ankles or legs
Gray or pale skin
Blue or purple lips or nail tips
Trouble speaking in full sentences
Blood streaks in mucus
What to Do at the First Sign of a Flare-up
At the first sign of a flare-up:
Do not panic. You may be able to keep symptoms from getting worse.
Take medicines as directed if your provider prescribes them. These may include quick-relief inhalers, steroids or antibiotics you take by mouth, anti-anxiety medicines, or medicine through a nebulizer.
Use oxygen if prescribed.
Use
pursed lip breathing
to save energy, slow your breathing, and help you relax.
If your symptoms do not get better within 48 hours, or your symptoms keep getting worse, contact your provider or go to the hospital.
How to Prevent COPD Flare-ups
If you have COPD:
Stop smoking and avoid secondhand smoke. Avoiding smoke is the best way to slow down damage to your lungs. Ask your provider about stop-smoking programs and other options, such as nicotine-replacement therapy.
Take your medicines as directed.
Ask your provider about pulmonary rehabilitation. This program includes exercise, breathing, and nutrition tips.
See your provider at least 1 to 2 times per year for check-ups, or more often if directed.
Use oxygen if your provider recommends it.
Avoid colds and the flu, you should:
Stay away from people with colds.
Wash your hands often. Carry hand sanitizer for times when you cannot wash your hands.
Get all of your recommended vaccines, including pneumococcal, influenza (flu), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and COVID-19 vaccines.
Avoid very cold air or extreme heat and humidity.
Keep air pollutants, such as fireplace smoke and dust, out of your home.
Live a healthy lifestyle:
Stay as active as possible. Try short walks and light weight-training. Talk with your provider about ways to get exercise.
Take frequent breaks throughout the day. Rest between daily activities to save your energy and give your lungs time to recover.
Eat a healthy diet rich in lean proteins, fish, fruits, and vegetables. Eat several small meals a day.
Do not drink liquids with meals. This will keep you from feeling too full. But, be sure to drink liquids at other times to keep from getting dehydrated.
When to Call the Doctor
After following your COPD action plan, contact your provider if your breathing is still:
Getting harder
Faster than before
Shallow and you cannot get a deep breath
Also contact your provider if:
You need to lean forward when sitting in order to breathe easily
You are using muscles around your ribs to help you breathe
You are having headaches more often
You feel sleepy or confused
You have a fever
You are coughing up dark mucus
Your lips, fingertips, or the skin around your fingernails is blue
You have chest pain or discomfort
