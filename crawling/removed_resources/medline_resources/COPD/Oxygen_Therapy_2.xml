Oxygen is a gas that is vital to human life. It is one of the gases that is found in the air we breathe. If you have a chronic lung disease, you may need additional (supplemental) oxygen for your organs to function normally.
Here are some conditions that may require supplemental oxygen, either temporarily or long-term:
COPD
(chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)
Pulmonary fibrosis
Pneumonia
A severe
asthma
attack
Cystic fibrosis
Sleep apnea
Although oxygen therapy may be common in the hospital, it can also be used at home. There are several devices used to deliver oxygen at home. Your healthcare provider will help you choose the equipment that works best for you. Oxygen is usually delivered through nasal prongs (an oxygen cannula) or a face mask. Oxygen equipment can attach to other medical equipment such as CPAP machines and ventilators.
Learning all you can about oxygen therapy can help you feel more comfortable and confident. Use the links below to learn more.

Warning about over the counter (OTC) portable oxygen concentrators:
You may have seen online advertisements for non-prescription, portable oxygen concentrators (POCs). While these are often more affordable, if you have a lung disease like COPD or pulmonary fibrosis, which requires you to use prescription oxygen,
these OTC devices may not meet your oxygen needs
and it would be important to speak with your health provider before purchasing.
