www.thoracic.orgCLIP AND COPYPulmonary rehabilitation (PR) can help answer these 
and other questions. Participating in a PR program will 
help decrease your shortness of breath and increase your 
ability to exercise. You may have heard that pulmonary 
rehabilitation is only for people with COPD (chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease). We now know that 
people with other lung conditions such as pulmonary 
hypertension, interstitial lung disease, pre/post transplant, 
and cystic fibrosis can benefit as well.
What is Pulmonary Rehabilitation?
Pulmonary rehabilitation is a program of education and 
exercise that helps you manage your breathing problem, 
increase your stamina (energy) and decrease your 
breathlessness. The education part of the program teaches 
you to be “in charge” of your breathing instead of your 
breathing being in charge of you. You will learn how to 
pace your breathing with your activities, how to take your 
medicines and how to talk with your healthcare provider. 
The exercise sessions are supervised by a pulmonary 
rehabilitation staff that prepares an exercise program just 
for you. The exercises start at a level that you can handle 
(some people start exercising while sitting and others 
on a treadmill). The amount of time you exercise will be 
increased in time and the level of difficulty will change 
based on your ability. As your muscles get stronger, you will 
exercise longer with less breathlessness and be less tired.   
How much time does a Pulmonary Rehabilitation 
Program take?
Most programs meet two to three times a week and 
programs can last 4 to 12 weeks or more. Because the 
program staff are constantly monitoring your progress 
and increasing your exercises as you are able, attending 
every session is important.  How will I know if Pulmonary Rehabilitation is 
right for me?
Your healthcare provider will determine if you qualify for 
pulmonary rehabilitation by:
■■Evaluating your current state of health and lung 
function test results 
■■Discussing your current activity level and your ability to 
do the things you want to do
■■Determining your willingness and ability to attend. 
Pulmonary rehabilitation programs are limited in the 
number of people who can attend so that you get close 
supervision. You will be evaluated before you begin the 
program to make sure you do not have health issues that 
would limit your ability to join. This evaluation may take 
place at the rehabilitation site or in a clinic by a physician, 
advanced practice nurse, or physician assistant. 
Once the program begins, a team of healthcare 
professionals (nurses, respiratory therapists, physical 
therapists, occupational therapists, psychologists, 
dieticians, social workers, spiritual advisors such as a 
chaplain and others) will work with you to put you in 
charge of your breathing. 
What will I learn in Pulmonary Rehabilitation?
The education part of the program happens both in a 
classroom, one-on-one with the professional staff, and 
during each exercise session. During group meetings, you 
will learn new ways to breathe during stressful times and 
while being active. You will practice these new breathing 
techniques during your exercise sessions. You will learn 
about your medications; what the medications do and 
how to use your inhalers to get the most benefit from 
them. During the program, you may be given an Action Pulmonary Rehabilitation

ATS Patient Education Series © 2018 American Thoracic SocietyIf you have shortness of breath because of lung problems, 
you may have asked yourself: 
• Can I exercise? 
• How can I get in better shape?
• What medications should I be taking?
• Can I do anything to improve my overall well-being?

having a lung flare-up (exacerbation). 
Some people with breathing problems need to use 
oxygen. During pulmonary rehabilitation you will be 
tested at rest and with exercise to see if oxygen may 
help you. You will learn the reasons why some people 
with shortness of breath use oxygen and others do not 
need it. 
If you smoke, the program will provide support for you to 
stop or guide you to a program that can help you to stop 
smoking. You will also learn how and when to call you 
healthcare provider, including what key points to share, 
and what questions to ask. Also during the program, 
you can expect to meet others that also have breathing 
problems. You will have the time to share concerns and 
learn from others living with lung disease. 
What will I do in the exercise sessions?
You may not think that you can exercise when just 
walking across the room makes you breathless. There 
are however, standard exercises that have been found to 
work well for people with breathing problems. The type 
and amount of exercise you will do will depend on what 
you can do now and as you get stronger, your exercises 
will increase. Exercise sessions begin with stretching 
exercises or warm ups, followed by exercises for your 
arms and legs. Usually you will do both exercises to build 
your strength and exercises to build your endurance 
(stamina). To build your strength, generally weights and 
lifting devices are used. For endurance, activities might 
include walking on a treadmill or in a corridor and/or 
using a stationary cycle. The amount of time you exercise 
depends on what you can handle. After attending 
pulmonary rehabilitation, people are frequently amazed 
at how much they can exercise and how much less short 
of breath they experience.
How can I find a Pulmonary Rehabilitation 
Program and what will it cost?
Ask your healthcare provider for a referral to a 
qualified program. Programs are often offered in an 
outpatient department of a hospital, including Veterans 
Administration hospitals. Some programs are certified 
by the American Association of Cardiovascular and 
Pulmonary Rehabilitation (AACVPR). The ATS maintains 
a directory of programs at https://www.livebetter.
org. Other national and local directories are available 
through AACRPR, COPDF, and PERF. The American Lung 
Association (ALA) can also help you find Better Breathers 
and PR programs in your area. The cost to you and insurance coverage of pulmonary 
rehabilitation can vary greatly depending on where you 
live and what program you choose. Medicare covers 
pulmonary rehabilitation for COPD, providing you 
meet certain requirements. Medicare may also cover 
rehabilitation for other lung conditions, but this varies 
with different regions of the country. The pulmonary 
rehabilitation program coordinator can tell you if you 
qualify and what the cost to you will be. 
What happens after I finish a Pulmonary 
Rehabilitation program?
It is so very important that you continue to exercise after 
finishing your rehabilitation program or you will lose all 
of the benefits you have gained. Before you “graduate”, 
the pulmonary rehabilitation staff will design for you a 
long-term plan of exercise for you. Many programs offer a 
“maintenance” plan so that you can continue to exercise 
with others with breathing problems.
