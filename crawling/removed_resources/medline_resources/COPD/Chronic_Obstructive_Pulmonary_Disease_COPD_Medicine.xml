How can you tell if the medicine you take is helping?
The medicine you take for COPD may not completely relieve the shortness of breath you often feel, but you should feel better.
If you are starting a new medication, it may take a few weeks before you feel a change. Watch for these signs that the medicine is helping:
You can do the same activities with less shortness of breath
You are able to walk more and be more active
You can do more chores and activities around the house
And, you don't tire as easily
Changes you may notice when the medication is helping include:
You can do the same activities earlier and with less shortness of breath.
You are able to walk more and be more active.
You can do more chores and activities around the house.
You don’t tire as easily.
You feel less short of breath.
Watch for these changes as your medication are adjusted. When you visit your health care provider, discuss any changes with him or her.
