By getting ahead of your symptoms and talking about them with  
your healthcare provider regularly, you can put yourself on the path 
to a better quality of life.
WHAT IS COPD?
Healthy lungs expand to fill with air 
and then bounce back to their original shape when air is exhaled, retaining lung structure and moving air quickly in and out. With COPD, the air sacs no longer 
bounce back to their original shape, and the airways can become swollen or thicker than normal. Increased mucus production and partially blocked airways make it even harder to get air in and out.WHAT YOU CAN DO:QUIT 
smokingIf you smoke, quitting is the best thing you  
can do to prevent more damage to your lungs. Ask your provider about new options for quitting. Many resources to help are available online. Visit smokefree.gov
; lung.org ; or call 
1-800-QUIT NOW for more information.
AVOID  
pollutantsTry to stay away from things that could irritate your lungs, like dust and strong fumes. Stay indoors when the outside air quality is poor, and avoid places where there might be cigarette smoke.

It’s not always easy to get all the information you need  
in the brief time of a typical office visit. Learn about  COPD before your visit so you can be prepared. 
LOG SYMPTOMS
Consider keeping a log of your symptoms for the days  or weeks before your appointment and bring it with you. Log details of what you were doing when you experienced any of these COPD symptoms and how long they lasted.
KNOW RISK FACTORS
•   History of smoking
•    Long-term exposure to pollution, 
certain chemicals and dusts
•   Some genetic conditions, such as alpha-1 
antitrypsin deficiency
Share all the risk factors you may have to help your  provider give you the best care.
KEEP NOTES
Write down any questions you have before the visit so  you can remember to ask them. Take notes during the visit, and don’t be afraid to ask the provider to repeat something if you don’t understand it. 
DON’T GO ALONE
If possible, bring a family member or friend with you.  Two sets of ears are always better than one when  hearing information about your health.COPD resources
