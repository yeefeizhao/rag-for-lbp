*Words that appear in bold italic are defined at the end of this pamphlet.This guide 
explains the 
role of exercise in treating 
CF. When 
you think of 
“exercise,” 
think of 
“activity,” 
more than 
gyms or health 
clubs. “Exercise” 
includes many 
activities. 
Before you get more active 
or start exercising, team up with 
your CF Care Center for advice 
and support.
Why Exercise? 
Because it helps you feel bet-ter! Children, teens and adults 
with CF who exercise do better 
than those who don’t. Their 
rate of lung function decline 
slows. They enjoy a more normal 
lifestyle. Regular exercise helps 
the heart so it is stronger dur-
ing stress. Regular exercise also 
helps the lung function so there 
are more reserves to use during 
*exacerbations , or lung infections. It’s hard to know if those 
with CF do bet-
ter because they 
are active or if 
they are active 
because their CF 
is milder. Either 
way, exercise 
helps! 
Exercise helps you 
be less limited in 
what you do with friends and 
family. The limits that CF may 
put on you will be worse if you 
are not active. Regular exercise 
can help you do the things that 
increase self-esteem and give con-
fidence to face each day.
Who Should Exercise?
Almost everyone can be helped 
by being more active. It is not a 
good idea to exercise if you have 
cor pulmonale, pulmonary hyper-
tension, an exacerbation  or respi-
ratory infection. 
What Kind of Exercise?
For all ages, there are three 
things to look at when choosing 
activities. The first is the activity 
itself. Do you like the activity?

Does it fit into your schedule? If 
not, you won’t stick with it. 
Second, do the activities connect 
you to friends or family? For 
children or teens, this may mean 
playing with a playgroup 
or sports team. For 
adults, this may mean 
finding an exercise 
partner. 
Third, are they 
cardiovascular  
exercises  or do 
they exercise 
your heart and 
lungs? Can 
you do them 
for more than 
20 minutes at 
a time? Activities 
that make your 
heart beat faster and 
harder over time 
make your heart and 
lungs stronger. They 
also help lower the 
risk of cancer, heart 
disease, circulation 
problems, diabetes, 
and high blood pres-
sure. Activities that 
involve weights or 
resistance  are good for helping 
you get stronger muscles and 
bones. Any exercise, even short 
easy bursts spread through the 
day, is better than no exercise. 
Harder and longer exercise (to a 
point) is best. Advice for Children,  
Teens and Adults
Children
It is vital for all children to 
develop good exercise habits and 
attitudes. This starts 
early and with 
the family. 
When fami-
lies commit to regular 
activ-
ity, children 
learn good 
habits and atti-
tudes. Find activities 
that are easy for 
all to do. Very 
young children 
carried in back-
packs on family hikes 
learn the joy of hik-
ing and soon join in 
walking. 
Expose children 
to many types of 
activities. Too often 
we push one kind 
or just a few, not 
knowing what the 
child will like and 
stick with. Children 
are more likely to find an activity they like and will do it if exposed 
to many varied activities early 
on. When children join in fam-
ily or group activities, reward 
them. The best rewards are those 
that grow good positive attitudes 
Tips for Children
• Involve them in many 
types of activities
• Reward them when they join group events
• Plan active playtime on most days of the week
• Keep TV and video game time to a minimum 3about joining in again, for exam-
ple a canoe rental or a special 
active trip. Be creative!
Planning active playtime on most 
days helps grow good attitudes 
toward activity in children less 
than 4 years old. 
Five- and 6-year 
olds can do more 
“adult,” “life-long” 
activities, like biking 
or hiking.
Watching TV and 
playing video games 
keep kids from 
being active. The 
more time children 
spend doing these 
things, the more 
likely they are to 
become unhealthy. 
Teens
Teens need activities that help them feel good around 
their peers. This is truer for teens 
whose activities are limited by 
lung disease.
Teens are more likely to stick 
with a regular activity program 
that increases their self-esteem. 
This is true with sports teams 
and leagues. Teens: put the 
sports teams and leagues to this 
test first and ask yourself:  
• “Are they run so that I will feel 
good about my growing skills?” • “Are those in charge trained to give me a good experience 
and do they care about my CF 
needs?” 
• “Is winning ‘num-ber one?’” Having 
fun should be most 
important in order 
for teens to want 
to stay involved.
• “Are players matched by age, 
skill and size, or 
am I sometimes overwhelmed by 
the other players?”
If you feel uneasy (fear of exposing 
CF, poor skill lev-
els, etc.) or unable 
(due to CF) to play 
on a sports team or 
league, think about 
a formal exercise 
program. If you are well enough, point systems (see page 6-7) can 
support you in meeting your 
goals through varied activities. 
Formal exercise programs can 
include treadmills, stationary 
bikes, etc. Before starting, you 
should have an 
exercise test  
ordered by your doctor. This test will show if your heart and lungs 
can handle the exercise. Rarely, 
exercise makes the hearts of some 
people with CF beat abnor-
mally. If this happens during the 
 4
test, your  heart rate  should be 
watched during exercise and your 
exercise kept at a lower level. 
Exercise should also be kept at a 
lower level if it causes 
low blood oxygen lev-
els. You should be 
monitored until you 
learn how to keep your 
exercise at a safe level. 
Adults
If adults haven’t made regular activity part 
of their lives, they 
must talk with their 
CF Care Center first. 
Some activities can make heart and lung 
disease and bone and joint prob-
lems worse. As with teens, an 
exercise test may be needed to 
find safe levels.
When planning an exercise  
program…  
• Pick comfortable activities to 
do that you like. This will help 
you stick with them.
• Choose activities that keep your heart and lungs exercising 
the whole time. 
• Find an exercise partner. This will also help you stick with it. 
• Do a variety of activities. This will reduce boredom and bone/
joint injuries. 
• Choose activities that fit your 
life. You may like to snow ski, but you can’t do it regularly if you live in Florida! Also, find 
an exercise time that fits your 
schedule. 
• Pick lifetime activi-ties like running and 
biking. Tackle foot-
ball is fun but isn’t 
something people do 
for too many years.
• Find some activities that aren’t extremely 
competitive (against 
others or yourself). 
Exercising “just for 
fun” lowers tension. 
• Set fair yet challeng-ing goals. Most of us 
won’t become paid
athletes, but w e can all improve 
our health. 
How’s the Weather?
With exercise, people with CF should be careful when it’s hot 
and humid. They don’t handle 
heat stress well. More sodium 
(Na+) and chloride (Cl-) or salt 
is lost in CF sweat, so drinking fluids is vital. Drink more fluids 
and choose fluids that maintain 
or replace Na+ and Cl- (electro-
lytes). Many sports drinks have 
a certain level of electrolytes to best absorb 
ions and fluid from 
the stomach into the blood. For those with CF, the level should 
be slightly higher. 
 5Safety
It is important to participate 
safely in whatever activities you 
choose. While one might say that 
the problem with common sense 
is that it isn’t common enough, 
that’s basically what it comes 
down to.
To reduce the risk of musculo-
skeletal  injuries be sure to par-
ticipate in any activity in mod-eration until you have built up 
enough stamina  to exercise at a 
higher intensity.
Pay attention to proper clothing, 
footwear and other gear required 
for your activities; wear a reflec-
tive vest in poor light conditions 
if you are exercising on the road; 
wear a bicycle helmet whenever 
you ride your bike, etc. 
GLOSSARY  
Blood oxygen levels:  How much oxy-
gen is in the blood. It is measured by 
a small monitor (oximeter) put on the finger.
Cor pulmonale: When the right lower 
part of the heart grows larger. This 
makes the heart less able to pump 
blood through the lungs.
Electrolytes: Chemical salts that help 
cells work. Electrolytes include sodium, chloride, potassium and bicarbonate.
Exacerbation: When there is an infec-
tion in the lungs. 
Exercise test:  An exercise is often 
done on a treadmill or stationary bike. 
The person will likely exercise for 10 to 15 minutes. The workout gets harder until they have to stop. During the test, the heart and lungs are watched for problems.
Cardiovascular exercises: Activities 
that use lots of muscles and last at 
least 20 minutes.Heart rate: How many times the heart 
beats in a minute. During exercise, a small heart monitor (electrocardio -
gram) can be used to watch heart rate. 
Ion: a charged atomic particle, such as 
sodium (Na
+) or chloride (Cl-).
Musculoskeletal:  The muscles and 
bones of the body.
Pulmonary hypertension: High blood 
pressure in the lungs.
Resistance activities: These activities 
make muscles work harder than nor-
mal, and strengthen muscles.
Stamina:  Staying power, ability to do 
something for a while. 6
Track Your Success to 
Exercise Your Lungs
The object of “Exercise Your 
Lungs” on the 
next page is to 
help you track 
your exercise 
program. To 
complete the 
chart, fill in a 
box with the 
appropriate 
symbol that 
represents the 
type of the activity you complet-
ed. The duration of your exercise 
activity will determine how many 
boxes to fill in with the symbol. 
For instance, if you ride your 
bike for 15 minutes, you fill in one box with a B and if you ride 
for 30 minutes, fill in two boxes. 
If you hike for 1 hour you get to 
fill in two boxes with H. And so 
on.
Activities that are 15 to 30 min-
utes are best. Choose activities 
that you like and try to find a 
partner to join you. Start your 
program slowly and work your 
way up, for example try to fill in 
10 to 12 boxes in week one and 
increase to 15 to 18 boxes by 
week four. Listen to your body; 
if it hurts too much, slow down.
When you complete one sheet, 
give yourself a reward such as a 
special family activity or a movie 
night! Suggestion
Make several 
copies of the chart on next page before using so you can keep your exercise reward pro-gram going! 7Exercise Your Lungs
