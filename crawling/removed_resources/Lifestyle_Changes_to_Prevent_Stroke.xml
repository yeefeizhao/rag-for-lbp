Lifestyle Changes 
to Prevent Stroke
A stroke occurs when a blood vessel 
that carries oxygen and nutrients to the 
brain is either blocked by a clot or bursts 
(or ruptures). Stroke affects the arteries 
leading to and within the brain. The 
good news is that many strokes may be 
prevented through blood pressure control, 
a healthy diet, regular physical activity 
and smoking cessation. Each plays a big 
part in decreasing your risk for stroke, 
disability or even death.
What steps can I take to be healthier and 
reduce my risk of stroke? 
• Don’t smoke or vape and avoid secondhand smoke. 
• Eat healthy foods low in saturated fat, trans fat and 
sodium (salt). Reduce sugary drinks.   
• Do regular physical activity.
• Keep a healthy weight.
• Limit alcohol to one drink a day for women; two drinks per day for men. 
• Take your medications as directed.
• Know your blood pressure. Optimal blood pressure is less than 120/80 mm Hg. Get your blood pressure checked regularly and work with your health care professional to manage it if it’s high. High blood pressure is a leading cause of stroke. 
• Reduce stress, which may contribute to behaviors such as overeating, lack of physical activity, unhealthy diet and smoking. 
• Have regular medical checkups, including assessment of your risk for stroke. 
• Get adequate sleep, 7-9 hours of sleep per night for adults; more for children and kids.How do I stop smoking or vaping?
• Make a decision to quit — and stick to it.
• Ask a health care professional for information, programs and/or medications that may help you quit.
• Call a quit line coach at 1-800-QUIT-NOW.
• Sign up for free texting programs or use a mobile app.  
• Know your triggers and eliminate them if possible. 
• Deal with urges by keeping busy, getting active, engaging in a new hobby, journaling or meditating.
• Remind yourself that smoking causes many diseases, can harm others and is deadly.
• Ask your family and friends to support you and keep you accountable.
How do I change my eating habits?
• Ask your doctor, nurse, a licensed nutritionist or registered dietitian about how you can come up with a plan that’s mindful of your special health needs. 
• Eat moderate amounts of food and cut down on saturated fat, trans fat, sugar and salt.
(continued) • Bake, broil, roast and boil foods instead of frying.
• Read nutrition labels on packaged meals. Look for the 
AHA Heart-Check mark on packaging.   
• Eat more fruits, vegetables, whole grains, healthy sources of protein, low-fat dairy and healthy oils.  
• Use a diary, or if available, a mobile app to track what you’re eating. Try to incorporate healthy substitutions or alternatives. 
What about physical activity?
• Set goals and keep reaching for them. Gradually increase your activity to gain even more health benefits.  
• Throughout the week, try to do 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity, 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity physical activity, or a combination of both.
 –Moderate-intensity physical activities include a brisk 
walk or water aerobics. Vigorous-intensity activities could 
include running, hiking or cycling. 
• Also, strive for moderate- to high-intensity muscle-strenghtening activity, such as resistance bands or weights, on at least two days per week.

• Short on time? Don’t just skip it; instead, break up your 
activity into smaller times to fit your schedule. 
• Look for even small chances to be more active. Take the stairs instead of an elevator, walk to the mailbox, and park farther from your destination.
• If you have a chronic medical condition, check with your health care professional before you start an exercise program.
