Also called: Embolic Stroke, Thrombotic stroke
Summary
A
stroke
is a medical emergency. There are two types - ischemic and
hemorrhagic
. Ischemic stroke is the more common type. It is usually caused by a
blood clot
that blocks or plugs a blood vessel in the brain. This keeps blood from flowing to the brain. Within minutes, brain cells begin to die.  Another cause is stenosis, or narrowing of the artery. This can happen because of
atherosclerosis
, a disease in which plaque builds up inside your arteries.
Transient ischemic attacks
(TIAs) occur when the blood supply to the brain is interrupted briefly. Having a TIA can mean you are at risk for having a more serious stroke.
Symptoms of stroke are:
Sudden numbness or weakness of the face, arm or leg (especially on one side of the body)
Sudden confusion, trouble speaking or understanding speech
Sudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes
Sudden trouble walking, dizziness, loss of balance or coordination
Sudden severe headache with no known cause
It is important to treat strokes as quickly as possible.
Blood thinners
may be used to stop a stroke while it is happening by quickly dissolving the blood clot.
Post-stroke rehabilitation
can help people overcome disabilities caused by stroke damage.
