The most effective treatment for
phenylketonuria (PKU)
is a special diet that carefully limits intake of the amino acid phenylalanine. People with PKU who begin this diet at birth or shortly thereafter develop normally and usually have no symptoms of PKU. It is important that individuals with PKU stay on the special diet through adolescence and that women with PKU continue the diet before and during pregnancy to promote the best health outcomes.
