Description
FOXG1
syndrome is a condition characterized by impaired development and structural brain abnormalities. Affected infants are small at birth, and their heads grow more slowly than normal, leading to an unusually small head size (
microcephaly
) by early childhood. The condition is associated with a particular pattern of brain malformations that includes a thin or underdeveloped connection between the right and left halves of the brain (a structure called
the corpus callosum
), reduced folds and grooves (gyri) on the surface of the brain, and a smaller than usual amount of brain tissue known as white matter.
FOXG1
syndrome affects most aspects of development, and children with the condition typically have severe intellectual disability. Abnormal or involuntary movements, such as jerking movements of the arms and legs and repeated hand motions, are common, and most affected children do not learn to sit or walk without assistance. Babies and young children with
FOXG1
syndrome often have feeding problems, sleep disturbances, seizures, irritability, and excessive crying. Affected individuals may have
autism spectrum disorder
, which is characterized by limited communication and social interaction, including poor eye contact and a near absence of speech and language skills.
FOXG1
syndrome was previously described as a congenital variant of
Rett syndrome
, which is a similar disorder of brain development. Both disorders are characterized by impaired development, intellectual disability, and problems with communication and language. However, Rett syndrome is diagnosed almost exclusively in females, while
FOXG1
syndrome affects both males and females. Rett syndrome also involves a period of apparently normal early development that does not occur in
FOXG1
syndrome. Because of these differences, physicians and researchers now usually consider
FOXG1
syndrome to be distinct from Rett syndrome.
Frequency
More than 100 cases of this rare condition have been reported.
Causes
As its name suggests,
FOXG1
syndrome is caused by changes involving the
FOXG1
gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein called forkhead box G1. This protein plays an important role in brain development before birth, particularly in a region of the embryonic brain known as the telencephalon. The telencephalon ultimately develops into several critical structures, including the the largest part of the brain (the cerebrum), which controls most voluntary activity, language, sensory perception, learning, and memory.
In some cases,
FOXG1
syndrome is caused by mutations within the
FOXG1
gene itself. In others, the condition results from a deletion of genetic material from a region of the long (q) arm of
chromosome 14
that includes the
FOXG1
gene. All of these genetic changes prevent the production of forkhead box G1 or impair the protein's function. A shortage of functional forkhead box G1 disrupts normal brain development starting before birth, which appears to underlie the structural brain abnormalities and severe developmental problems characteristic of
FOXG1
syndrome.

Inheritance
FOXG1
syndrome is considered an
autosomal dominant
condition, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. All reported cases have resulted from new mutations or deletions involving the
FOXG1
gene and have occurred in people with no history of the disorder in their family. Because the condition is so severe, no one with
FOXG1
syndrome has been known to have children.
