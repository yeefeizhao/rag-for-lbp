If you’re looking for a complementary health practitioner to help treat a medical problem, it is important to be as careful and thorough in your search as you are when looking for conventional care.
Here are some tips to help you in your search:
If you need names of practitioners in your area, first check with your doctor or other health care provider.
A nearby hospital or medical school, professional organizations, state regulatory agencies or licensing boards, or even your health insurance provider may be helpful. Unfortunately, the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) cannot refer you to practitioners.
Find out as much as you can about any potential practitioner, including education, training, licensing, and certifications.
The credentials
required for complementary health practitioners vary tremendously from state to state and from discipline to discipline.
Once you have found a possible practitioner, here are some tips about deciding whether he or she is right for you:
Find out whether the practitioner is willing to work together with your conventional health care providers.
For safe, coordinated care, it’s important for all of the professionals involved in your health to communicate and cooperate.
Explain all of your health conditions to the practitioner, and find out about the practitioner’s training and experience in working with people who have your conditions.
Choose a practitioner who understands how to work with people with your specific needs, even if general well-being is your goal. And, remember that health conditions can affect the safety of complementary approaches; for example, if you have glaucoma, some yoga poses may not be safe for you.
Don’t assume that your health insurance will cover the practitioner’s services.
Contact your health insurance provider and ask. Insurance plans differ greatly in what complementary health approaches they cover, and even if they cover a particular approach, restrictions may apply.
Tell all your health care providers about the complementary approaches you use and about all practitioners who are treating you.
Keeping your health care providers fully informed helps you to stay in control and effectively manage your health.
