Getting back to your daily activities may involve occupational and physical therapy. Get tips and find creative ways to get things done.
A stroke is a life-changing event — physically and emotionally. It can make everyday activities challenging. These challenges may be due to several stroke-related conditions, such as limb weakness, numbness or paralysis, communication challenges, vision challenges and one-side neglect challenges. Getting dressed, making a meal, doing laundry, or staying organized for the week may become big obstacles. Simple everyday tasks may need to be relearned and you may need more frequent rest breaks. Every stroke is unique, and your recovery will be too.
