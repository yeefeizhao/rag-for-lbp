What CDC is doing
CDC and its partners are leading national initiatives and programs to reduce rates of death and disability caused by stroke and to help people live longer, healthier lives.
CDC's Division for Heart Disease and Stroke Prevention (DHDSP) provides resources to all 50 states to address heart disease and stroke, as well as helping lead or support the following:
The
WISEWOMAN
program screens women aged 35 to 64 who with low incomes and little or no insurance for chronic disease risk factors and refers them to lifestyle programs in an effort to prevent heart disease and strokes.
The Paul Coverdell National Acute Stroke Program funds states to measure, track, and improve the quality of care for stroke patients. The program works to reduce death and disability from stroke.
The
Million Hearts
®
initiative, which is co-led by CDC and the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services, works with other federal agencies and private-sector partners to raise awareness about heart disease and stroke and prevent heart attacks and strokes.
