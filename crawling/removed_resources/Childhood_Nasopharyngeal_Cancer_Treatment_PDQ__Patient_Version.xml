Key Points
Nasopharyngeal cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the nasal cavity and throat.
Being infected with the Epstein-Barr virus increases the risk of nasopharyngeal cancer.
Signs and symptoms of nasopharyngeal cancer include headache and blocked or stuffy nose.
Tests that examine the nasopharynx are used to help diagnose nasopharyngeal cancer.
Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery).
Nasopharyngeal cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the nasal cavity and throat.
Nasopharyngeal cancer
is a disease in which
malignant
(cancer)
cells
form in the
nasopharynx
. The nasopharynx is made of the
nasal cavity
(inside of the nose) and top part of the
throat
.
Nasopharyngeal cancer is more common in teens than in children younger than 10 years of age.

Anatomy of the nasopharynx. The nasopharynx is in the upper part of the pharynx (throat) behind the nose. The nostrils lead into the nasopharynx. An opening on each side of the nasopharynx leads into the ear.
Being infected with the Epstein-Barr virus increases the risk of nasopharyngeal cancer.
Anything that increases your chance of getting a disease is called a
risk factor
. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get
cancer
; not having risk factors doesn't mean that you will not get cancer. Talk with your child's doctor if you think your child may be at risk.
Being
infected
with the
Epstein-Barr virus
(EBV) is strongly linked to having nasopharyngeal cancer.
Signs and symptoms of nasopharyngeal cancer include headache and blocked or stuffy nose.
These and other
signs
and
symptoms
may be caused by nasopharyngeal cancer or by other
conditions
.
Check with your child's doctor if your child has any of the following:
Headache.
Blocked or stuffy nose.
Nosebleeds.
Earache.
Ear infection.
Hearing loss.
Problems moving the jaw.
Trouble speaking.
Trouble seeing or droopy eyelid.
Lumps in the neck that may be painful.
Tests that examine the nasopharynx are used to help diagnose nasopharyngeal cancer.
The following tests and procedures may be used:
Physical exam
and
health history
: An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patient’s health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.
MRI
(magnetic resonance imaging)
: A procedure that uses a magnet,
radio waves
, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas of the body, such as the head and neck. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).
Nasal
endoscopy
: A procedure to look at
organs
and
tissues
inside the body to check for
abnormal
areas. A flexible or rigid
endoscope
is inserted through the nose.  An endoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a
lens
for viewing. It may also have a tool to remove tissue samples, which are checked under a
microscope
by a
pathologist
for signs of disease.
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) tests
:
Blood tests
to check for
antibodies
to the Epstein-Barr virus and
DNA
markers
of the Epstein-Barr virus. These are found in the
blood
of patients who have been infected with EBV.
Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery).
Prognosis
depends on:
Whether the cancer has just been
diagnosed
or has
recurred
(come back).
Stages of Nasopharyngeal Cancer
Key Points
After nasopharyngeal cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the nasal cavity and throat or to other parts of the body.
There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.
Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.
Sometimes childhood nasopharyngeal cancer  does not respond to treatment or comes back after treatment.
After nasopharyngeal cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the nasal cavity and throat or to other parts of the body.
To plan treatment, it is important to know whether
cancer
cells
have spread within the
nasal cavity
or to other parts of the body. The process used to find out if cancer has spread is called
staging
.
Most children with
nasopharyngeal cancer
are at an advanced
stage
at the time of
diagnosis
. Nasopharyngeal cancer spreads most often to the bone,
lung
, and
liver
.
The following tests and procedures may be used to find out if cancer has spread:
Neurological exam
: A series of questions and tests to check the
brain
,
spinal cord
, and
nerve
function. The exam checks a person’s mental status, coordination, and ability to walk normally, and how well the muscles,
senses
, and reflexes work. This may also be called a neuro exam or a neurologic exam.
Chest x-ray
: An
x-ray
of the
organs
and bones inside the chest.  An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.
PET-CT scan
: A procedure that combines the pictures from a
PET scan
and a
CT scan
. The PET and CT scans are done at the same time on the same machine. The pictures from both scans are combined to make a more detailed picture than either test would make by itself.
CT scan (CAT scan)
: A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the chest or
abdomen
, taken from different angles.  The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A
dye
may be
injected
into a
vein
or swallowed to help the organs or
tissues
show up more clearly.  This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.
PET scan (positron emission tomography scan)
: A procedure to find
malignant
tumor
cells in the body.  A small amount of
radioactive glucose
(sugar) is injected into a vein.  The PET
scanner
rotates around the body and makes a picture of where
glucose
is being used in the body.  Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do.
Bone scan
: A procedure to check if there are rapidly dividing cells, such as cancer cells, in the bone.  A very small amount of
radioactive
material is injected into a vein and travels through the bloodstream.  The radioactive material collects in the bones with cancer and is detected by a scanner.

As the child lies on a table that slides under the scanner, the radioactive material is detected and images are made on a computer screen.
There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.
Cancer can spread through
tissue
, the
lymph system
, and the
blood
:
Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.
Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the
lymph vessels
to other parts of the body.
Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the
blood vessels
to other parts of the body.
Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.
When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called
metastasis
. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the
primary tumor
) and travel through the lymph system or blood.
Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a
tumor
(
metastatic
tumor) in another part of the body.
Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.
The
metastatic
tumor is the same type of cancer as the
primary tumor
. For example, if  nasopharyngeal cancer spreads to the lung, the cancer cells in the lung are actually nasopharyngeal cancer cells. The disease is metastatic nasopharyngeal cancer, not
lung cancer
.
Many cancer deaths are caused when cancer moves from the original tumor and spreads to other tissues and organs. This is called metastatic cancer. This animation shows how cancer cells travel from the place in the body where they first formed to other parts of the body.
Sometimes childhood nasopharyngeal cancer  does not respond to treatment or comes back after treatment.
Refractory
nasopharyngeal cancer is cancer that does not respond to treatment.
Recurrent
nasopharyngeal cancer is cancer that has
recurred
(come back) in the
nasopharynx
or in other parts of the body such as the bone, lung, or liver.
Treatment Option Overview
Key Points
There are different types of treatment for children with nasopharyngeal cancer.
Children with nasopharyngeal cancer should have their treatment planned by a team of doctors who are experts in treating childhood cancer.
Four types of standard treatment are used:
Chemotherapy
Radiation therapy
Surgery
Immunotherapy
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
Treatment for childhood nasopharyngeal cancer may cause side effects.
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
Follow-up tests may be needed.
There are different types of treatment for children with nasopharyngeal cancer.
Some treatments are
standard
(the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in
clinical trials
.  A treatment clinical trial is a
research study
meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the  standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment.
Because cancer in children is rare, taking part in a clinical trial should be considered.  Some clinical trials are open only to patients  who have not started treatment.
Children with nasopharyngeal cancer should have their treatment planned by a team of doctors who are experts in treating childhood cancer.
Treatment will be overseen by a
pediatric oncologist
, a doctor who specializes in treating children with
cancer
. The pediatric oncologist works with other
pediatric
health professionals who are experts in treating children with cancer and who specialize in certain areas of
medicine
. This may include the following
specialists
and others:
Pediatrician
.
Pediatric surgeon
.
Radiation oncologist
.
Pediatric ear, nose, and throat specialist.
Pathologist
.
Pediatric nurse specialist
.
Social worker
.
Rehabilitation specialist
.
Psychologist
.
Child-life specialist
.
Four types of standard treatment are used:
Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy
is a cancer treatment that uses
drugs
to stop the growth of cancer
cells
, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or
injected
into a
vein
or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (
systemic chemotherapy
).
Radiation therapy
Radiation therapy
is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy
x-rays
or other types of
radiation
to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing.
External radiation therapy
uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the area of the body with cancer.
Surgery
Surgery
to remove the
tumor
is done if the tumor has not spread throughout the
nasal cavity
and
throat
at the time of
diagnosis
.
Immunotherapy
Immunotherapy
is a treatment that uses the patient’s
immune system
to fight cancer. Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the body’s natural defenses against cancer. This cancer treatment is a type of
biologic therapy
.
Several types of immunotherapy are being used or studied to treat children with
nasopharyngeal cancer
:
Interferon
may stop cancer cells from growing and it may also help kill cancer cells.
EBV
-specific
cytotoxic T-lymphocytes
are a type of immune cell that can kill certain cells, including
foreign
cells, cancer cells, and cells infected with the
Epstein-Barr virus
. Cytotoxic T-lymphocytes can be separated from other
blood
cells, grown in the laboratory, and then given to the patient to kill cancer cells. EBV-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes are being studied to treat
refractory
or
recurrent
nasopharyngeal cancer.
Immune checkpoint inhibitor
therapy blocks certain
proteins
.
PD-1
is a protein on the surface of
T cells
that helps keep the body’s
immune responses
in check.
PD-L1
is a protein found on some types of cancer cells. When PD-1 attaches to PD-L1, it stops the T cell from killing the cancer cell. PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors keep PD-1 and PD-L1 proteins from attaching to each other. This allows the T cells to kill cancer cells.
Pembrolizumab
and
nivolumab
are types of PD-1 inhibitors that have been used to treat adults with refractory nasopharyngeal cancer and may be considered to treat children.
Enlarge
Immune checkpoint inhibitor. Checkpoint proteins, such as PD-L1 on tumor cells and PD-1 on T cells, help keep immune responses in check. The binding of PD-L1 to PD-1 keeps T cells from killing tumor cells in the body (left panel). Blocking the binding of PD-L1 to PD-1 with an immune checkpoint inhibitor (anti-PD-L1 or anti-PD-1) allows the T cells to kill tumor cells (right panel).
Immunotherapy uses the body’s immune system to fight cancer. This animation explains one type of immunotherapy that uses immune checkpoint inhibitors to treat cancer.
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
Information about clinical trials is available from the
NCI website
.
Treatment for childhood nasopharyngeal cancer may cause side effects.
To learn more about
side effects
that begin during treatment for cancer, visit
Side Effects
.
Side effects from cancer treatment that begin after treatment and continue for months or years are called
late effects
. Late effects of cancer treatment may include:
Physical problems that affect the following:
Problems with the
thyroid gland
.
Decreased mouth function.
Hearing loss or
chronic
ear
infections
.
Dental cavities.
Chronic
sinusitis
.
Changes in mood, feelings, thinking, learning, or memory.
Second cancers
(new types of cancer) or other
conditions
.
Some late effects may be treated or controlled. It is important to talk with your child's doctors about the possible late effects caused by some treatments.  See the
PDQ
summary on
Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer
for more information.
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
For some patients, taking part in a
clinical trial
may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer  treatments are safe and effective or better than the
standard treatment
.
Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first  to receive a new treatment.
Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.
Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the
side effects
of cancer treatment.
Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about clinical trials supported by NCI can be found on NCI’s
clinical trials search
webpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the
ClinicalTrials.gov
website.
Follow-up tests may be needed.
As your child goes through treatment, they will have follow-up tests or check-ups. Some tests that were done to
diagnose
or
stage
the cancer may be repeated to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.
Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your child's condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back).

About This PDQ Summary
About PDQ
Physician Data Query (PDQ) is the National Cancer Institute's (NCI's) comprehensive cancer information database. The PDQ database contains summaries of the latest published information on cancer prevention, detection, genetics, treatment, supportive care, and complementary and alternative medicine. Most summaries come in two versions. The health professional versions have detailed information written in technical language. The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language. Both versions have cancer information that is accurate and up to date and most versions are also available in
Spanish
.
PDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal government’s center of biomedical research.  The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH.
Purpose of This Summary
This PDQ cancer information summary has current information about the treatment of childhood nasopharyngeal cancer.  It is meant to inform and help patients, families, and caregivers. It does not give formal guidelines or recommendations for making decisions about health care.
Reviewers and Updates
Editorial Boards write the PDQ cancer information summaries and keep them up to date. These Boards are made up of experts in cancer treatment and other specialties related to cancer. The summaries are reviewed regularly and changes are made when there is new information. The date on each summary ("Updated") is the date of the most recent change.
The information in this patient summary was taken from the health professional version, which is reviewed regularly and updated as needed, by the
PDQ Pediatric Treatment Editorial Board
.
Clinical Trial Information
A clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become "standard." Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
Clinical trials can be found online at

There are different types of treatment for children with nasopharyngeal cancer.
Some treatments are
standard
(the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in
clinical trials
.  A treatment clinical trial is a
research study
meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the  standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment.
Because cancer in children is rare, taking part in a clinical trial should be considered.  Some clinical trials are open only to patients  who have not started treatment.
Children with nasopharyngeal cancer should have their treatment planned by a team of doctors who are experts in treating childhood cancer.
Treatment will be overseen by a
pediatric oncologist
, a doctor who specializes in treating children with
cancer
. The pediatric oncologist works with other
pediatric
health professionals who are experts in treating children with cancer and who specialize in certain areas of
medicine
. This may include the following
specialists
and others:
Pediatrician
.
Pediatric surgeon
.
Radiation oncologist
.
Pediatric ear, nose, and throat specialist.
Pathologist
.
Pediatric nurse specialist
.
Social worker
.
Rehabilitation specialist
.
Psychologist
.
Child-life specialist
.
Four types of standard treatment are used:
Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy
is a cancer treatment that uses
drugs
to stop the growth of cancer
cells
, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or
injected
into a
vein
or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (
systemic chemotherapy
).
Radiation therapy
Radiation therapy
is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy
x-rays
or other types of
radiation
to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing.
External radiation therapy
uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the area of the body with cancer.
Surgery
Surgery
to remove the
tumor
is done if the tumor has not spread throughout the
nasal cavity
and
throat
at the time of
diagnosis
.
Immunotherapy
Immunotherapy
is a treatment that uses the patient’s
immune system
to fight cancer. Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the body’s natural defenses against cancer. This cancer treatment is a type of
biologic therapy
.
Several types of immunotherapy are being used or studied to treat children with
nasopharyngeal cancer
:
Interferon
may stop cancer cells from growing and it may also help kill cancer cells.
EBV
-specific
cytotoxic T-lymphocytes
are a type of immune cell that can kill certain cells, including
foreign
cells, cancer cells, and cells infected with the
Epstein-Barr virus
. Cytotoxic T-lymphocytes can be separated from other
blood
cells, grown in the laboratory, and then given to the patient to kill cancer cells. EBV-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes are being studied to treat
refractory
or
recurrent
nasopharyngeal cancer.
Immune checkpoint inhibitor
therapy blocks certain
proteins
.
PD-1
is a protein on the surface of
T cells
that helps keep the body’s
immune responses
in check.
PD-L1
is a protein found on some types of cancer cells. When PD-1 attaches to PD-L1, it stops the T cell from killing the cancer cell. PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors keep PD-1 and PD-L1 proteins from attaching to each other. This allows the T cells to kill cancer cells.
Pembrolizumab
and
nivolumab
are types of PD-1 inhibitors that have been used to treat adults with refractory nasopharyngeal cancer and may be considered to treat children.
Enlarge

The binding of PD-L1 to PD-1 keeps T cells from killing tumor cells in the body (left panel). Blocking the binding of PD-L1 to PD-1 with an immune checkpoint inhibitor (anti-PD-L1 or anti-PD-1) allows the T cells to kill tumor cells (right panel).
Immunotherapy uses the body’s immune system to fight cancer. This animation explains one type of immunotherapy that uses immune checkpoint inhibitors to treat cancer.
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
Information about clinical trials is available from the
NCI website
.
Treatment for childhood nasopharyngeal cancer may cause side effects.
To learn more about
side effects
that begin during treatment for cancer, visit
Side Effects
.
Side effects from cancer treatment that begin after treatment and continue for months or years are called
late effects
. Late effects of cancer treatment may include:
Physical problems that affect the following:
Problems with the
thyroid gland
.
Decreased mouth function.
Hearing loss or
chronic
ear
infections
.
Dental cavities.
Chronic
sinusitis
.
Changes in mood, feelings, thinking, learning, or memory.
Second cancers
(new types of cancer) or other
conditions
.
Some late effects may be treated or controlled. It is important to talk with your child's doctors about the possible late effects caused by some treatments.  See the
PDQ
summary on
Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer
for more information.
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
For some patients, taking part in a
clinical trial
may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer  treatments are safe and effective or better than the
standard treatment
.
Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first  to receive a new treatment.
Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.
Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the
side effects
of cancer treatment.
Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about clinical trials supported by NCI can be found on NCI’s
clinical trials search
webpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the
ClinicalTrials.gov
website.
Follow-up tests may be needed.
As your child goes through treatment, they will have follow-up tests or check-ups. Some tests that were done to
diagnose
or
stage
the cancer may be repeated to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.
Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your child's condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back).

About This PDQ Summary
About PDQ
Physician Data Query (PDQ) is the National Cancer Institute's (NCI's) comprehensive cancer information database. The PDQ database contains summaries of the latest published information on cancer prevention, detection, genetics, treatment, supportive care, and complementary and alternative medicine. Most summaries come in two versions. The health professional versions have detailed information written in technical language. The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language. Both versions have cancer information that is accurate and up to date and most versions are also available in
Spanish
.
PDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal government’s center of biomedical research.  The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH.
Purpose of This Summary
This PDQ cancer information summary has current information about the treatment of childhood nasopharyngeal cancer.  It is meant to inform and help patients, families, and caregivers. It does not give formal guidelines or recommendations for making decisions about health care.
Reviewers and Updates
Editorial Boards write the PDQ cancer information summaries and keep them up to date. These Boards are made up of experts in cancer treatment and other specialties related to cancer. The summaries are reviewed regularly and changes are made when there is new information. The date on each summary ("Updated") is the date of the most recent change.
The information in this patient summary was taken from the health professional version, which is reviewed regularly and updated as needed, by the
PDQ Pediatric Treatment Editorial Board
.
Clinical Trial Information
A clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become "standard." Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
Clinical trials can be found online at
NCI's website

Childhood Nasopharyngeal Cancer Treatment (PDQ®)–Patient Version
General Information About Childhood Nasopharyngeal Cancer
Go to Health Professional Version
Key Points
Nasopharyngeal cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the nasal cavity and throat.
Being infected with the Epstein-Barr virus increases the risk of nasopharyngeal cancer.
Signs and symptoms of nasopharyngeal cancer include headache and blocked or stuffy nose.
Tests that examine the nasopharynx are used to help diagnose nasopharyngeal cancer.
Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery).
Nasopharyngeal cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the nasal cavity and throat.
Nasopharyngeal cancer
is a disease in which
malignant
(cancer)
cells
form in the
nasopharynx
. The nasopharynx is made of the
nasal cavity
(inside of the nose) and top part of the
throat
.
Nasopharyngeal cancer is more common in teens than in children younger than 10 years of age.
Enlarge
Anatomy of the nasopharynx. The nasopharynx is in the upper part of the pharynx (throat) behind the nose. The nostrils lead into the nasopharynx. An opening on each side of the nasopharynx leads into the ear.
Being infected with the Epstein-Barr virus increases the risk of nasopharyngeal cancer.
Anything that increases your chance of getting a disease is called a
risk factor
. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get
cancer
; not having risk factors doesn't mean that you will not get cancer. Talk with your child's doctor if you think your child may be at risk.
Being
infected
with the
Epstein-Barr virus
(EBV) is strongly linked to having nasopharyngeal cancer.
Signs and symptoms of nasopharyngeal cancer include headache and blocked or stuffy nose.
These and other
signs
and
symptoms
may be caused by nasopharyngeal cancer or by other
conditions
.
Check with your child's doctor if your child has any of the following:
Headache.
Blocked or stuffy nose.
Nosebleeds.
Earache.
Ear infection.
Hearing loss.
Problems moving the jaw.
Trouble speaking.
Trouble seeing or droopy eyelid.
Lumps in the neck that may be painful.
Tests that examine the nasopharynx are used to help diagnose nasopharyngeal cancer.
The following tests and procedures may be used:
Physical exam
and
health history
: An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patient’s health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.
MRI
(magnetic resonance imaging)
: A procedure that uses a magnet,
radio waves
, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas of the body, such as the head and neck. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).
Nasal
endoscopy
: A procedure to look at
organs
and
tissues
inside the body to check for
abnormal
areas. A flexible or rigid
endoscope
is inserted through the nose.  An endoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a
lens
for viewing. It may also have a tool to remove tissue samples, which are checked under a
microscope
by a
pathologist
for signs of disease.
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) tests
:
Blood tests
to check for
antibodies
to the Epstein-Barr virus and
DNA
markers
of the Epstein-Barr virus. These are found in the
blood
of patients who have been infected with EBV.
Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery).
Prognosis
depends on:
Whether the cancer has just been
diagnosed
or has
recurred
(come back).
Stages of Nasopharyngeal Cancer
Key Points
After nasopharyngeal cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the nasal cavity and throat or to other parts of the body.
There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.
Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.
Sometimes childhood nasopharyngeal cancer  does not respond to treatment or comes back after treatment.
After nasopharyngeal cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the nasal cavity and throat or to other parts of the body.
To plan treatment, it is important to know whether
cancer
cells
have spread within the
nasal cavity
or to other parts of the body. The process used to find out if cancer has spread is called
staging
.
Most children with
nasopharyngeal cancer
are at an advanced
stage
at the time of
diagnosis
. Nasopharyngeal cancer spreads most often to the bone,
lung
, and
liver
.
The following tests and procedures may be used to find out if cancer has spread:
Neurological exam
: A series of questions and tests to check the
brain
,
spinal cord
, and
nerve
function. The exam checks a person’s mental status, coordination, and ability to walk normally, and how well the muscles,
senses
, and reflexes work. This may also be called a neuro exam or a neurologic exam.
Chest x-ray
: An
x-ray
of the
organs
and bones inside the chest.  An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.
PET-CT scan
: A procedure that combines the pictures from a
PET scan
and a
CT scan
. The PET and CT scans are done at the same time on the same machine. The pictures from both scans are combined to make a more detailed picture than either test would make by itself.
CT scan (CAT scan)
: A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the chest or
abdomen
, taken from different angles.  The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A
dye
may be
injected
into a
vein
or swallowed to help the organs or
tissues
show up more clearly.  This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.
PET scan (positron emission tomography scan)
: A procedure to find
malignant
tumor
cells in the body.  A small amount of
radioactive glucose
(sugar) is injected into a vein.  The PET
scanner
rotates around the body and makes a picture of where
glucose
is being used in the body.  Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do.
Bone scan
: A procedure to check if there are rapidly dividing cells, such as cancer cells, in the bone.  A very small amount of
radioactive
material is injected into a vein and travels through the bloodstream.  The radioactive material collects in the bones with cancer and is detected by a scanner.
Enlarge
Bone scan.  A small amount of radioactive material is injected into the child's vein and travels through the blood. The radioactive material collects in the bones. As the child lies on a table that slides under the scanner, the radioactive material is detected and images are made on a computer screen.
There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.
Cancer can spread through
tissue
, the
lymph system
, and the
blood
:
Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.
Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the
lymph vessels
to other parts of the body.
Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the
blood vessels
to other parts of the body.
Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.
When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called
metastasis
. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the
primary tumor
) and travel through the lymph system or blood.
Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a
tumor
(
metastatic
tumor) in another part of the body.
Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.
The
metastatic
tumor is the same type of cancer as the
primary tumor
. For example, if  nasopharyngeal cancer spreads to the lung, the cancer cells in the lung are actually nasopharyngeal cancer cells. The disease is metastatic nasopharyngeal cancer, not
lung cancer
.
Many cancer deaths are caused when cancer moves from the original tumor and spreads to other tissues and organs. This is called metastatic cancer. This animation shows how cancer cells travel from the place in the body where they first formed to other parts of the body.
Sometimes childhood nasopharyngeal cancer  does not respond to treatment or comes back after treatment.
Refractory
nasopharyngeal cancer is cancer that does not respond to treatment.
Recurrent
nasopharyngeal cancer is cancer that has
recurred
(come back) in the
nasopharynx
or in other parts of the body such as the bone, lung, or liver.

Most summaries come in two versions. The health professional versions have detailed information written in technical language. The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language. Both versions have cancer information that is accurate and up to date and most versions are also available in
Spanish
.
PDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal government’s center of biomedical research.  The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH.

Clinical Trial Information
A clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become "standard." Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
Clinical trials can be found online at
NCI's website
