Key Points
Esthesioneuroblastoma is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the upper nasal cavity and base of the skull.
Signs and symptoms of esthesioneuroblastoma include nosebleeds and the loss of sense of smell.
Tests that examine the nasal cavity are used to help diagnose esthesioneuroblastoma.
Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery).
Esthesioneuroblastoma is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the upper nasal cavity and base of the skull.
Esthesioneuroblastoma
begins in the
olfactory
nerve
endings in the upper part of the
nasal cavity
. The olfactory nerves (sense of smell) pass through the many tiny holes in the bone at the base of the
brain
to the
olfactory bulb
. Esthesioneuroblastoma is also called olfactory neuroblastoma.

Esthesioneuroblastomas form in the olfactory nerve endings in the upper part of the nasal cavity. The olfactory nerves (sense of smell) pass through the many tiny holes in the bone at the base of the brain to the olfactory bulb. Esthesioneuroblastomas may spread from the nasal cavity to the nasal sinuses or to nearby tissue. They may also spread to the brain or to other parts of the body (not shown).
Esthesioneuroblastoma affects adults and children. Even though it is very rare, esthesioneuroblastoma is the most common
cancer
of the nasal cavity in children and teens. This summary is about the treatment of children and teens with esthesioneuroblastoma.
Signs and symptoms of esthesioneuroblastoma include nosebleeds and the loss of sense of smell.
These and other
signs
and
symptoms
may be caused by esthesioneuroblastoma or by other
conditions
. Check with your child's doctor if your child has any of the following:
A
mass
in the nose.
Trouble breathing through the nose.
Change in or loss of the sense of smell.
Nosebleeds.
Headache.
Bulging of the eye.
Trouble seeing.
Eye pain.
Tests that examine the nasal cavity are used to help diagnose esthesioneuroblastoma.
In addition to asking about your child's personal and family
health history
and doing a
physical exam
, your child's doctor may perform the following tests and procedures.
Nasal
endoscopy
: A procedure to look at
organs
and
tissues
inside the body to check for
abnormal
areas. A flexible or rigid
endoscope
is inserted through the nose. An endoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a
lens
for viewing. It may also have a tool to remove tissue samples, which are checked under a
microscope
by a
pathologist
for signs of disease.
MRI
(magnetic resonance imaging)
: A procedure that uses a magnet,
radio waves
, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas of the body, such as the head and neck. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).
CT scan
(CAT scan)
: A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the head and neck or
lymph nodes
, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an
x-ray
machine. A
dye
may be
injected
into a
vein
or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.
Enlarge
Computed tomography (CT) scan of the head and neck. The child lies on a table that slides through the CT scanner, which takes a series of detailed x-ray pictures of the inside of the head and neck.
PET scan
(positron emission tomography scan)
: A procedure to find
malignant
tumor
cells
in the body. A small amount of
radioactive glucose
(sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET
scanner
rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do.
Biopsy
: The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer.
The following tests may be done on the sample of cells or tissues that were removed:
Immunohistochemistry
: A
laboratory test
that uses
antibodies
to check for certain
antigens
(
markers
) in a sample of a patient’s tissue. The antibodies are usually linked to an
enzyme
or a fluorescent dye. After the antibodies bind to a specific antigen in the tissue sample, the enzyme or dye is activated, and the antigen can then be seen under a microscope. This type of test is used to help
diagnose
cancer and to help tell one type of cancer from another type of cancer.
Genetic analysis
: A laboratory test in which cells or tissue are analyzed to look for changes in
genes
or
chromosomes
. These changes may be a sign that a person has or is at risk of having a specific disease or condition.
Electron microscopy
: A laboratory test in which cells in a sample of tissue are viewed under regular and high-powered microscopes to look for certain changes in the cells.
Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery).
The
prognosis
depends on the following:
Whether the cancer is in the nose only or if it has spread to the
nasal
sinuses
, lymph nodes, or to other parts of the body.
Whether the tumor was completely removed by
surgery
.
Stages of Esthesioneuroblastoma
Key Points
After esthesioneuroblastoma has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread to nearby areas or to other parts of the body.
There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.
Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.
The following stages are used for esthesioneuroblastoma:
Stage A
Stage B
Stage C
Stage D
Sometimes childhood esthesioneuroblastoma comes back after treatment.
After esthesioneuroblastoma has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread to nearby areas or to other parts of the body.
The process used to find out if
cancer
has spread to
tissues
near the
nasal cavity
or to other parts of the body is called
staging
. The information gathered from the staging process determines the
stage
of the disease. The results of the tests used to
diagnose
cancer are often also used to stage the disease. It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment. For more information on the tests used to diagnose
esthesioneuroblastoma
, see the
General Information
section.
The following tests and procedures may be used to find out if cancer has spread:
Chest x-ray
: An
x-ray
of the
organs
and bones inside the chest. An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.
PET-CT scan
: Sometimes a
PET scan
and a
CT scan
are done at the same time. If there is any cancer, this increases the chance that it will be found.
CT scan (CAT scan)
: A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the chest or
abdomen
, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A
dye
may be
injected
into a
vein
or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.
PET scan (positron emission tomography scan)
: A procedure to find
malignant
tumor
cells
in the body.  A small amount of
radioactive glucose
(sugar) is injected into a vein.  The PET
scanner
rotates around the body and makes a picture of where
glucose
is being used in the body.  Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do.
Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy
:  The removal of tissue or
fluid
from an enlarged
lymph node
, using a thin needle.  A
pathologist
views the tissue or fluid under a
microscope
to look for cancer cells.
There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.
Cancer can spread through
tissue
, the
lymph system
, and the
blood
:
Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.
Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the
lymph vessels
to other parts of the body.
Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the
blood vessels
to other parts of the body.
Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.
When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called
metastasis
. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the
primary tumor
) and travel through the lymph system or blood.
Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a
tumor
(
metastatic
tumor) in another part of the body.
Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.
The
metastatic
tumor is the same type of cancer as the
primary tumor
. For example, if esthesioneuroblastoma spreads to the
lung
, the cancer cells in the lung are actually esthesioneuroblastoma cells. The disease is metastatic esthesioneuroblastoma, not
lung cancer
.
Many cancer deaths are caused when cancer moves from the original tumor and spreads to other tissues and organs. This is called metastatic cancer. This animation shows how cancer cells travel from the place in the body where they first formed to other parts of the body.
The following stages are used for esthesioneuroblastoma:
Stage A
In
stage A
,
cancer
is found in the
nasal cavity
only.
Stage B
In
stage B
,
cancer
has spread from the
nasal cavity
to the
nasal
sinuses
.
Stage C
In
stage C
,
cancer
has spread through the
nasal
sinuses
to nearby
tissue
.
Stage D
In
stage D
,
cancer
has spread to distant parts of the body, such as the
lymph nodes
in the neck, or to the
brain
,
bone  marrow
, or
lung
.
Sometimes childhood esthesioneuroblastoma comes back after treatment.
The cancer may
recur
(come back) in the original cancer site,
central nervous system
, or lymph nodes after it has been treated.
Treatment Option Overview
Key Points
There are different types of treatment for children with esthesioneuroblastoma.
Children with esthesioneuroblastoma should have their treatment planned by a team of doctors who are experts in treating childhood cancer.
Three types of standard treatment are used:
Surgery
Radiation therapy
Chemotherapy
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
Targeted therapy
Treatment for childhood esthesioneuroblastoma may cause side effects.
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
Follow-up tests may be needed.
There are different types of treatment for children with esthesioneuroblastoma.
Some treatments are
standard
(the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in
clinical trials
.  A treatment clinical trial is a
research study
meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the  standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment.
Because cancer in children is rare, taking part in a clinical trial should be considered.  Some clinical trials are open only to patients  who have not started treatment.
Children with esthesioneuroblastoma should have their treatment planned by a team of doctors who are experts in treating childhood cancer.
Treatment will be overseen by a
pediatric oncologist
, a doctor who specializes in treating children with cancer. The pediatric oncologist works with other pediatric health professionals who are experts in treating children with cancer and who specialize in certain areas of medicine. This may include the following specialists and others:
Pediatrician
.
Pediatric surgeon
.
Radiation oncologist
.
Pathologist
.
Pediatric nurse specialist
.
Social worker
.
Rehabilitation specialist
.
Psychologist
.
Child-life specialist
.
Three types of standard treatment are used:
Surgery
Surgery
to remove the
tumor
is one of the main treatments used for
esthesioneuroblastoma
.
After the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, some patients may be given
chemotherapy
or
radiation therapy
to kill any cancer
cells
that are left. Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called
adjuvant therapy
.
Radiation therapy
Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy
x-rays
or other types of
radiation
to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing.
External radiation therapy
uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the area of the body with cancer.
Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses
drugs
to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or
injected
into a
vein
or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (
systemic chemotherapy
).
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in
clinical trials
. It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the
NCI website
.
Targeted therapy
Targeted therapy
is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells.
Targeted therapy is being studied for the treatment of childhood esthesioneuroblastoma that has
recurred
(come back).
Treatment for childhood esthesioneuroblastoma may cause side effects.
To learn more about
side effects
that begin during treatment for cancer, visit
Side Effects
.
Side effects from cancer treatment that begin after treatment and continue for months or years are called
late effects
. Late effects of cancer treatment may include:
Physical problems.
Changes in mood, feelings, thinking, learning, or memory.
Second cancers
(new types of
cancer
) or other
conditions
.
Some late effects may be treated or controlled. It is important to talk with your child's doctors about the possible late effects caused by some treatments.  For more information, see
Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer
.
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
For some patients, taking part in a
clinical trial
may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer  treatments are safe and effective or better than the
standard treatment
.
Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first  to receive a new treatment.
Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.
Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the
side effects
of cancer treatment.
Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about clinical trials supported by NCI can be found on NCI’s
clinical trials search
webpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the
ClinicalTrials.gov
website.
Follow-up tests may be needed.
As your child goes through treatment, they will have follow-up tests or check-ups. Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer may be repeated to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.
Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your child's condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back).

About This PDQ Summary
About PDQ
Physician Data Query (PDQ) is the National Cancer Institute's (NCI's) comprehensive cancer information database. The PDQ database contains summaries of the latest published information on cancer prevention, detection, genetics, treatment, supportive care, and complementary and alternative medicine. Most summaries come in two versions. The health professional versions have detailed information written in technical language. The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language. Both versions have cancer information that is accurate and up to date and most versions are also available in
Spanish
.
PDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal government’s center of biomedical research.  The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH.
Purpose of This Summary
This PDQ cancer information summary has current information about the treatment of childhood esthesioneuroblastoma.  It is meant to inform and help patients, families, and caregivers. It does not give formal guidelines or recommendations for making decisions about health care.
Reviewers and Updates
Editorial Boards write the PDQ cancer information summaries and keep them up to date. These Boards are made up of experts in cancer treatment and other specialties related to cancer. The summaries are reviewed regularly and changes are made when there is new information. The date on each summary ("Updated") is the date of the most recent change.
The information in this patient summary was taken from the health professional version, which is reviewed regularly and updated as needed, by the
PDQ Pediatric Treatment Editorial Board
.
Clinical Trial Information
A clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become "standard." Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
Clinical trials can be found online at
NCI's website
. For more information, call the

Stages of Esthesioneuroblastoma
Key Points
After esthesioneuroblastoma has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread to nearby areas or to other parts of the body.
There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.
Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.
The following stages are used for esthesioneuroblastoma:
Stage A
Stage B
Stage C
Stage D
Sometimes childhood esthesioneuroblastoma comes back after treatment.
After esthesioneuroblastoma has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread to nearby areas or to other parts of the body.
The process used to find out if
cancer
has spread to
tissues
near the

is being used in the body.  Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do.
Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy
:  The removal of tissue or
fluid
from an enlarged
lymph node
, using a thin needle.  A
pathologist
views the tissue or fluid under a
microscope
to look for cancer cells.
There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.
Cancer can spread through
tissue
, the
lymph system
, and the
blood
:
Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.
Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the
lymph vessels
to other parts of the body.
Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the
blood vessels
to other parts of the body.
Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.
When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called
metastasis
. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the
primary tumor
) and travel through the lymph system or blood.
Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a
tumor
(
metastatic
tumor) in another part of the body.
Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.
The
metastatic
tumor is the same type of cancer as the
primary tumor
. For example, if esthesioneuroblastoma spreads to the
lung
, the cancer cells in the lung are actually esthesioneuroblastoma cells. The disease is metastatic esthesioneuroblastoma, not
lung cancer
.
Many cancer deaths are caused when cancer moves from the original tumor and spreads to other tissues and organs. This is called metastatic cancer. This animation shows how cancer cells travel from the place in the body where they first formed to other parts of the body.
The following stages are used for esthesioneuroblastoma:
Stage A
In
stage A
,
cancer
is found in the
nasal cavity
only.
Stage B
In
stage B
,
cancer
has spread from the
nasal cavity
to the
nasal
sinuses
.
Stage C
In
stage C
,
cancer
has spread through the
nasal
sinuses
to nearby
tissue
.
Stage D
In
stage D
,
cancer
has spread to distant parts of the body, such as the
lymph nodes
in the neck, or to the
brain
,
bone  marrow
, or
lung
.
Sometimes childhood esthesioneuroblastoma comes back after treatment.
The cancer may
recur
(come back) in the original cancer site,
central nervous system
, or lymph nodes after it has been treated.
Treatment Option Overview
Key Points
There are different types of treatment for children with esthesioneuroblastoma.
Children with esthesioneuroblastoma should have their treatment planned by a team of doctors who are experts in treating childhood cancer.
Three types of standard treatment are used:
Surgery
Radiation therapy
Chemotherapy
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
Targeted therapy
Treatment for childhood esthesioneuroblastoma may cause side effects.
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
Follow-up tests may be needed.
There are different types of treatment for children with esthesioneuroblastoma.
Some treatments are
standard
(the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in
clinical trials
.  A treatment clinical trial is a
research study
meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the  standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment.
Because cancer in children is rare, taking part in a clinical trial should be considered.  Some clinical trials are open only to patients  who have not started treatment.
Children with esthesioneuroblastoma should have their treatment planned by a team of doctors who are experts in treating childhood cancer.
Treatment will be overseen by a
pediatric oncologist
, a doctor who specializes in treating children with cancer. The pediatric oncologist works with other pediatric health professionals who are experts in treating children with cancer and who specialize in certain areas of medicine. This may include the following specialists and others:
Pediatrician
.
Pediatric surgeon
.
Radiation oncologist
.
Pathologist
.
Pediatric nurse specialist
.
Social worker
.
Rehabilitation specialist
.
Psychologist
.
Child-life specialist
.
Three types of standard treatment are used:
Surgery
Surgery
to remove the
tumor
is one of the main treatments used for
esthesioneuroblastoma
.
After the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, some patients may be given
chemotherapy
or
radiation therapy
to kill any cancer
cells
that are left. Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called
adjuvant therapy
.
Radiation therapy
Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy
x-rays
or other types of
radiation
to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing.
External radiation therapy
uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the area of the body with cancer.
Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses
drugs
to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or
injected
into a
vein
or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (
systemic chemotherapy
).
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in
clinical trials
. It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the
NCI website
.
Targeted therapy
Targeted therapy
is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells.
Targeted therapy is being studied for the treatment of childhood esthesioneuroblastoma that has
recurred
(come back).
Treatment for childhood esthesioneuroblastoma may cause side effects.
To learn more about
side effects
that begin during treatment for cancer, visit
Side Effects
.
Side effects from cancer treatment that begin after treatment and continue for months or years are called
late effects
. Late effects of cancer treatment may include:
Physical problems.
Changes in mood, feelings, thinking, learning, or memory.
Second cancers
(new types of
cancer
) or other
conditions
.
Some late effects may be treated or controlled. It is important to talk with your child's doctors about the possible late effects caused by some treatments.  For more information, see
Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer
.
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
For some patients, taking part in a
clinical trial
may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer  treatments are safe and effective or better than the
standard treatment
.
Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first  to receive a new treatment.
Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.
Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the
side effects
of cancer treatment.
Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about clinical trials supported by NCI can be found on NCI’s
clinical trials search
webpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the
ClinicalTrials.gov
website.
Follow-up tests may be needed.
As your child goes through treatment, they will have follow-up tests or check-ups. Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer may be repeated to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.
Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your child's condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back).

About This PDQ Summary
About PDQ
Physician Data Query (PDQ) is the National Cancer Institute's (NCI's) comprehensive cancer information database. The PDQ database contains summaries of the latest published information on cancer prevention, detection, genetics, treatment, supportive care, and complementary and alternative medicine. Most summaries come in two versions. The health professional versions have detailed information written in technical language. The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language. Both versions have cancer information that is accurate and up to date and most versions are also available in
Spanish
.
PDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal government’s center of biomedical research.  The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH.
Purpose of This Summary
This PDQ cancer information summary has current information about the treatment of childhood esthesioneuroblastoma.  It is meant to inform and help patients, families, and caregivers. It does not give formal guidelines or recommendations for making decisions about health care.
Reviewers and Updates
Editorial Boards write the PDQ cancer information summaries and keep them up to date. These Boards are made up of experts in cancer treatment and other specialties related to cancer. The summaries are reviewed regularly and changes are made when there is new information. The date on each summary ("Updated") is the date of the most recent change.
The information in this patient summary was taken from the health professional version, which is reviewed regularly and updated as needed, by the
PDQ Pediatric Treatment Editorial Board
.
Clinical Trial Information
A clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become "standard." Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
Clinical trials can be found online at
NCI's website
. For more information, call the
Cancer Information Service

Childhood Esthesioneuroblastoma Treatment (PDQ®)–Patient Version
General Information About Childhood Esthesioneuroblastoma
Go to Health Professional Version
Key Points
Esthesioneuroblastoma is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the upper nasal cavity and base of the skull.
Signs and symptoms of esthesioneuroblastoma include nosebleeds and the loss of sense of smell.
Tests that examine the nasal cavity are used to help diagnose esthesioneuroblastoma.
Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery).
Esthesioneuroblastoma is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the upper nasal cavity and base of the skull.
Esthesioneuroblastoma
begins in the
olfactory
nerve
endings in the upper part of the
nasal cavity
. The olfactory nerves (sense of smell) pass through the many tiny holes in the bone at the base of the
brain
to the
olfactory bulb
. Esthesioneuroblastoma is also called olfactory neuroblastoma.
Enlarge
Esthesioneuroblastomas form in the olfactory nerve endings in the upper part of the nasal cavity. The olfactory nerves (sense of smell) pass through the many tiny holes in the bone at the base of the brain to the olfactory bulb. Esthesioneuroblastomas may spread from the nasal cavity to the nasal sinuses or to nearby tissue. They may also spread to the brain or to other parts of the body (not shown).
Esthesioneuroblastoma affects adults and children. Even though it is very rare, esthesioneuroblastoma is the most common
cancer
of the nasal cavity in children and teens. This summary is about the treatment of children and teens with esthesioneuroblastoma.
Signs and symptoms of esthesioneuroblastoma include nosebleeds and the loss of sense of smell.
These and other
signs
and
symptoms
may be caused by esthesioneuroblastoma or by other
conditions
. Check with your child's doctor if your child has any of the following:
A
mass
in the nose.
Trouble breathing through the nose.
Change in or loss of the sense of smell.
Nosebleeds.
Headache.
Bulging of the eye.
Trouble seeing.
Eye pain.
Tests that examine the nasal cavity are used to help diagnose esthesioneuroblastoma.
In addition to asking about your child's personal and family
health history
and doing a
physical exam
, your child's doctor may perform the following tests and procedures.
Nasal
endoscopy
: A procedure to look at
organs
and
tissues
inside the body to check for
abnormal
areas. A flexible or rigid
endoscope
is inserted through the nose. An endoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a
lens
for viewing. It may also have a tool to remove tissue samples, which are checked under a
microscope
by a
pathologist
for signs of disease.
MRI
(magnetic resonance imaging)
: A procedure that uses a magnet,
radio waves
, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas of the body, such as the head and neck. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).
CT scan
(CAT scan)
: A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the head and neck or
lymph nodes
, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an
x-ray
machine. A
dye
may be
injected
into a
vein
or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.
Enlarge
Computed tomography (CT) scan of the head and neck. The child lies on a table that slides through the CT scanner, which takes a series of detailed x-ray pictures of the inside of the head and neck.
PET scan
(positron emission tomography scan)
: A procedure to find
malignant
tumor
cells
in the body. A small amount of
radioactive glucose
(sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET
scanner
rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do.
Biopsy
: The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer.
The following tests may be done on the sample of cells or tissues that were removed:
Immunohistochemistry
: A
laboratory test
that uses
antibodies
to check for certain
antigens
(
markers
) in a sample of a patient’s tissue. The antibodies are usually linked to an
enzyme
or a fluorescent dye. After the antibodies bind to a specific antigen in the tissue sample, the enzyme or dye is activated, and the antigen can then be seen under a microscope. This type of test is used to help
diagnose
cancer and to help tell one type of cancer from another type of cancer.
Genetic analysis
: A laboratory test in which cells or tissue are analyzed to look for changes in
genes
or
chromosomes
. These changes may be a sign that a person has or is at risk of having a specific disease or condition.
Electron microscopy
: A laboratory test in which cells in a sample of tissue are viewed under regular and high-powered microscopes to look for certain changes in the cells.
Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery).
The
prognosis
depends on the following:
Whether the cancer is in the nose only or if it has spread to the
nasal
sinuses
, lymph nodes, or to other parts of the body.
Whether the tumor was completely removed by
surgery
.
Stages of Esthesioneuroblastoma
Key Points
After esthesioneuroblastoma has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread to nearby areas or to other parts of the body.
There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.
Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.
The following stages are used for esthesioneuroblastoma:
Stage A
Stage B
Stage C
Stage D
Sometimes childhood esthesioneuroblastoma comes back after treatment.
After esthesioneuroblastoma has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread to nearby areas or to other parts of the body.
The process used to find out if
cancer
has spread to
tissues
near the
nasal cavity
or to other parts of the body is called
staging
. The information gathered from the staging process determines the
stage
of the disease. The results of the tests used to
diagnose
cancer are often also used to stage the disease. It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment. For more information on the tests used to diagnose
esthesioneuroblastoma
, see the
General Information
section.
The following tests and procedures may be used to find out if cancer has spread:
Chest x-ray
: An
x-ray
of the
organs
and bones inside the chest. An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.
PET-CT scan
: Sometimes a
PET scan
and a
CT scan
are done at the same time. If there is any cancer, this increases the chance that it will be found.
CT scan (CAT scan)
: A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the chest or
abdomen
, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A
dye
may be
injected
into a
vein
or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.

Stage D
In
stage D
,
cancer
has spread to distant parts of the body, such as the
lymph nodes
in the neck, or to the
brain
,
bone  marrow
, or

.
Sometimes childhood esthesioneuroblastoma comes back after treatment.
The cancer may
recur
(come back) in the original cancer site,
central nervous system

ClinicalTrials.gov
website.
Follow-up tests may be needed.
As your child goes through treatment, they will have follow-up tests or check-ups. Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer may be repeated to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.
Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your child's condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back).

About This PDQ Summary
About PDQ
Physician Data Query (PDQ) is the National Cancer Institute's (NCI's) comprehensive cancer information database. The PDQ database contains summaries of the latest published information on cancer prevention, detection, genetics, treatment, supportive care, and complementary and alternative medicine. Most summaries come in two versions. The health professional versions have detailed information written in technical language. The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language. Both versions have cancer information that is accurate and up to date and most versions are also available in
Spanish
.
PDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal government’s center of biomedical research.  The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH.
Purpose of This Summary
This PDQ cancer information summary has current information about the treatment of childhood esthesioneuroblastoma.  It is meant to inform and help patients, families, and caregivers. It does not give formal guidelines or recommendations for making decisions about health care.
Reviewers and Updates
Editorial Boards write the PDQ cancer information summaries and keep them up to date. These Boards are made up of experts in cancer treatment and other specialties related to cancer. The summaries are reviewed regularly and changes are made when there is new information. The date on each summary ("Updated") is the date of the most recent change.
The information in this patient summary was taken from the health professional version, which is reviewed regularly and updated as needed, by the
PDQ Pediatric Treatment Editorial Board
.
Clinical Trial Information
A clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become "standard." Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
Clinical trials can be found online at
NCI's website
. For more information, call the
Cancer Information Service
(CIS), NCI's contact center, at 1-800-4-CANCER (1-800-422-6237).
