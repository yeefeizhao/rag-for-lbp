Key Points
Oral cavity cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the mouth.
Most tumors in the oral cavity are benign (not cancer).
Being infected with the human papillomavirus (HPV) may increase the risk of oral cavity cancer.
Signs and symptoms of oral cavity cancer include a sore that does not heal.
Tests that examine the mouth and throat are used to diagnose oral cavity cancer.
Oral cavity cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the mouth.
The
oral cavity
includes the following:
The front two thirds of the tongue.
The
gingiva
(gums).
The
buccal mucosa
(the lining of the inside of the cheeks).
The floor (bottom) of the mouth under the tongue.
The
hard palate
(the roof of the mouth).
The
retromolar trigone
(the small area behind the
wisdom teeth
).

Anatomy of the oral cavity. The oral cavity includes the lips, hard palate (the bony front portion of the roof of the mouth), soft palate (the muscular back portion of the roof of the mouth), retromolar trigone (the area behind the wisdom teeth), front two-thirds of the tongue, gingiva (gums), buccal mucosa (the inner lining of the lips and cheeks), and floor of the mouth under the tongue.
Most tumors in the oral cavity are benign (not cancer).
Oral cavity cancer
in children is very rare. More than 90% of
tumors
in the mouths of children are
benign
. When oral cavity cancer occurs, the most common types are
lymphoma
and
sarcoma
.
Squamous cell carcinoma
(
cancer
that forms in the thin, flat
cells
lining the inside of the mouth) is rare in children.
Both benign and
malignant
oral cavity tumors can affect eating or speaking and need treatment.
Being infected with the human papillomavirus (HPV) may increase the risk of oral cavity cancer.
Anything that increases your chance of getting a disease is called a
risk factor
. Not every child with one or more of these risk factors will develop oral cavity cancer, and it will develop in some children who don't have any known risk factors. Talk with your child's doctor if you think your child may be at risk.
Risk factors for oral cavity cancer in children and adolescents include the following:
Being
infected
with
HPV
.
Having certain
genetic
conditions
, such as
Fanconi anemia
,
dyskeratosis congenita
,
connexin gene
mutations
,
epidermolysis bullosa
, or
xeroderma pigmentosum
.
Having
chronic
graft-versus-host disease
.
Signs and symptoms of oral cavity cancer include a sore that does not heal.
These and other
signs
and
symptoms
may be caused by oral cavity cancer or by other conditions.
Check with your child's doctor if your child has any of the following:
A sore in the mouth that does not heal.
A lump or thickening in the mouth.
A white or red patch on the gums, tongue, or lining of the mouth.
Bleeding or pain in the mouth.
Tests that examine the mouth and throat are used to diagnose oral cavity cancer.
In addition to asking about your child's
personal
and
family health history
and doing a
physical exam
, your child's doctor may perform the following tests and procedures.
Oral
exam
: An exam to check the oral cavity for
abnormal
areas. This exam may be done while under
anesthesia
. The medical doctor or
dentist
will feel the entire inside of the mouth with a gloved finger and examine the oral cavity with a small long-handled mirror and lights or a
fiberoptic
device. This will include checking the insides of the cheeks and lips; the gums; the roof and floor of the mouth; and the top, bottom, and sides of the tongue. The neck will be felt for swollen
lymph nodes
. A dental exam may also be done.
X-ray
: An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of the inside of the body.
MRI
(magnetic resonance imaging)
: A procedure that uses a magnet,
radio waves
, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas of the body, such as the head and neck. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).
CT scan
(CAT scan)
: A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the head or neck, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A
dye
may be
injected
into a
vein
or swallowed to help the
organs
or
tissues
show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.
Enlarge
Computed tomography (CT) scan of the head and neck. The child lies on a table that slides through the CT scanner, which takes a series of detailed x-ray pictures of the inside of the head and neck.
PET scan
(positron emission tomography scan)
: A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body.  A small amount of
radioactive glucose
(sugar) is injected into a vein.  The PET
scanner
rotates around the body and makes a picture of where
glucose
is being used in the body.  Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do.
Enlarge
Positron emission tomography (PET) scan. The child lies on a table that slides through the PET scanner. The head rest and white strap help the child lie still.  A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into the child's vein, and a scanner makes a picture of where the glucose is being used in the body.  Cancer cells show up brighter in the picture because they take up more glucose than normal cells do.
Biopsy
: The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a
microscope
by a
pathologist
to check for signs of cancer.
Fine-needle aspiration biopsy
: The removal of tissue or
fluid
using a thin needle.
Incisional biopsy
: The removal of part of a lump or a sample of tissue that doesn’t look normal.
Stages of Childhood Oral Cavity Cancer
Key Points
There is no standard staging system for childhood oral cavity cancer.
There is no standard staging system for childhood oral cavity cancer.
The process used to find out if
cancer
has spread from the
oral cavity
to nearby areas or to other parts of the body is called
staging
. There is no standard
staging system
for childhood
oral cavity cancer
. The results of the
tests and procedures
done to
diagnose
oral cavity cancer are used to help make decisions about treatment.
Sometimes childhood oral cavity cancer
recurs
(comes back) after treatment.
Treatment Option Overview
Key Points
There are different types of treatment for children with oral cavity cancer.
Children with oral cavity cancer should have their treatment planned by a team of doctors who are experts in treating childhood cancer.
Three types of standard treatment are used:
Surgery
Chemotherapy
Radiation therapy
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
Targeted therapy
Treatment for childhood oral cavity cancer may cause side effects.
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
Follow-up tests may be needed.
There are different types of treatment for children with oral cavity cancer.
Some treatments are
standard
(the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in
clinical trials
.  A treatment clinical trial is a
research study
meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the  standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment.
Because cancer in children is rare, taking part in a clinical trial should be considered.  Some clinical trials are open only to patients  who have not started treatment.
Children with oral cavity cancer should have their treatment planned by a team of doctors who are experts in treating childhood cancer.
Treatment will be overseen by a
pediatric oncologist
, a doctor who specializes in treating children with
cancer
. The pediatric oncologist works with other
pediatric
health professionals who are experts in treating children with cancer and who specialize in certain areas of
medicine
. This may include the following
specialists
and others:
Pediatrician
.
Pediatric surgeon
.
Radiation oncologist
.
Pathologist
.
Pediatric ear, nose, and throat specialist.
Pediatric nurse specialist
.
Social worker
.
Rehabilitation specialist
.
Psychologist
.
Child-life specialist
.
Three types of standard treatment are used:
Surgery
Surgery
is the most common treatment for
benign
oral cavity
tumors
and
oral cavity cancer
in children.
Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy
is a cancer treatment that uses
drugs
to stop the growth of cancer
cells
, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or
injected
into a
vein
or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (
systemic chemotherapy
).
Radiation therapy
Radiation therapy
is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy
x-rays
or other types of
radiation
to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing.
External radiation therapy
uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the area of the body with cancer.
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in
clinical trials
. It may not mention every new treatment being studied. 
Information about clinical trials is available from the
NCI website
.
Targeted therapy
Targeted therapy
is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells. Targeted therapy is being studied for the treatment of childhood oral cavity cancer that has
recurred
(come back).
Treatment for childhood oral cavity cancer may cause side effects.
To learn more about
side effects
that begin during treatment for cancer, visit
Side Effects
.
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
For some patients, taking part in a
clinical trial
may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer  treatments are safe and effective or better than the
standard treatment
.
Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first  to receive a new treatment.
Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.
Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the
side effects
of cancer treatment.
Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about clinical trials supported by NCI can be found on NCI’s
clinical trials search
webpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the
ClinicalTrials.gov
website.
Follow-up tests may be needed.
As your child goes through treatment, they will have follow-up tests or check-ups. Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer may be repeated to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.
Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your child's condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back).

About This PDQ Summary
About PDQ
Physician Data Query (PDQ) is the National Cancer Institute's (NCI's) comprehensive cancer information database. The PDQ database contains summaries of the latest published information on cancer prevention, detection, genetics, treatment, supportive care, and complementary and alternative medicine. Most summaries come in two versions. The health professional versions have detailed information written in technical language. The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language. Both versions have cancer information that is accurate and up to date and most versions are also available in
Spanish
.
PDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal government’s center of biomedical research.  The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH.
Purpose of This Summary
This PDQ cancer information summary has current information about the treatment of childhood oral cavity cancer.  It is meant to inform and help patients, families, and caregivers. It does not give formal guidelines or recommendations for making decisions about health care.
Reviewers and Updates
Editorial Boards write the PDQ cancer information summaries and keep them up to date. These Boards are made up of experts in cancer treatment and other specialties related to cancer. The summaries are reviewed regularly and changes are made when there is new information. The date on each summary ("Updated") is the date of the most recent change.
The information in this patient summary was taken from the health professional version, which is reviewed regularly and updated as needed, by the
PDQ Pediatric Treatment Editorial Board
.
Clinical Trial Information
A clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become "standard." Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
Clinical trials can be found online at
NCI's website
. For more information, call the

Clinical Trial Information
A clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become "standard." Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
Clinical trials can be found online at
NCI's website
. For more information, call the
Cancer Information Service
(CIS), NCI's contact center, at 1-800-4-CANCER (1-800-422-6237).

Childhood Oral Cavity Cancer Treatment (PDQ®)–Patient Version
General Information About Childhood Oral Cavity Cancer
Go to Health Professional Version
Key Points
Oral cavity cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the mouth.
Most tumors in the oral cavity are benign (not cancer).
Being infected with the human papillomavirus (HPV) may increase the risk of oral cavity cancer.
Signs and symptoms of oral cavity cancer include a sore that does not heal.
Tests that examine the mouth and throat are used to diagnose oral cavity cancer.
Oral cavity cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the mouth.
The
oral cavity
includes the following:
The front two thirds of the tongue.
The
gingiva
(gums).
The
buccal mucosa
(the lining of the inside of the cheeks).
The floor (bottom) of the mouth under the tongue.
The
hard palate
(the roof of the mouth).
The
retromolar trigone
(the small area behind the
wisdom teeth
).

Anatomy of the oral cavity. The oral cavity includes the lips, hard palate (the bony front portion of the roof of the mouth), soft palate (the muscular back portion of the roof of the mouth), retromolar trigone (the area behind the wisdom teeth), front two-thirds of the tongue, gingiva (gums), buccal mucosa (the inner lining of the lips and cheeks), and floor of the mouth under the tongue.
Most tumors in the oral cavity are benign (not cancer).
Oral cavity cancer
in children is very rare. More than 90% of
tumors
in the mouths of children are
benign
. When oral cavity cancer occurs, the most common types are
lymphoma
and
sarcoma
.
Squamous cell carcinoma
(
cancer
that forms in the thin, flat
cells
lining the inside of the mouth) is rare in children.
Both benign and
malignant
oral cavity tumors can affect eating or speaking and need treatment.
Being infected with the human papillomavirus (HPV) may increase the risk of oral cavity cancer.
Anything that increases your chance of getting a disease is called a
risk factor
. Not every child with one or more of these risk factors will develop oral cavity cancer, and it will develop in some children who don't have any known risk factors. Talk with your child's doctor if you think your child may be at risk.
Risk factors for oral cavity cancer in children and adolescents include the following:
Being
infected
with
HPV
.
Having certain
genetic
conditions
, such as
Fanconi anemia
,
dyskeratosis congenita
,
connexin gene
mutations
,
epidermolysis bullosa
, or
xeroderma pigmentosum
.
Having
chronic
graft-versus-host disease
.
Signs and symptoms of oral cavity cancer include a sore that does not heal.
These and other
signs
and
symptoms
may be caused by oral cavity cancer or by other conditions.
Check with your child's doctor if your child has any of the following:
A sore in the mouth that does not heal.
A lump or thickening in the mouth.
A white or red patch on the gums, tongue, or lining of the mouth.
Bleeding or pain in the mouth.
Tests that examine the mouth and throat are used to diagnose oral cavity cancer.
In addition to asking about your child's
personal
and
family health history
and doing a
physical exam
, your child's doctor may perform the following tests and procedures.
Oral
exam
: An exam to check the oral cavity for
abnormal
areas. This exam may be done while under
anesthesia
. The medical doctor or
dentist
will feel the entire inside of the mouth with a gloved finger and examine the oral cavity with a small long-handled mirror and lights or a
fiberoptic
device. This will include checking the insides of the cheeks and lips; the gums; the roof and floor of the mouth; and the top, bottom, and sides of the tongue. The neck will be felt for swollen
lymph nodes
. A dental exam may also be done.
X-ray
: An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of the inside of the body.
MRI
(magnetic resonance imaging)
: A procedure that uses a magnet,
radio waves
, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas of the body, such as the head and neck. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).
CT scan
(CAT scan)
: A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the head or neck, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A
dye
may be
injected
into a
vein
or swallowed to help the
organs
or
tissues
show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.
Enlarge
Computed tomography (CT) scan of the head and neck. The child lies on a table that slides through the CT scanner, which takes a series of detailed x-ray pictures of the inside of the head and neck.
PET scan
(positron emission tomography scan)
: A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body.  A small amount of
radioactive glucose
(sugar) is injected into a vein.  The PET
scanner
rotates around the body and makes a picture of where
glucose
is being used in the body.  Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do.
Enlarge
Positron emission tomography (PET) scan. The child lies on a table that slides through the PET scanner. The head rest and white strap help the child lie still.  A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into the child's vein, and a scanner makes a picture of where the glucose is being used in the body.  Cancer cells show up brighter in the picture because they take up more glucose than normal cells do.
Biopsy
: The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a
microscope
by a
pathologist
to check for signs of cancer.
Fine-needle aspiration biopsy
: The removal of tissue or
fluid
using a thin needle.
Incisional biopsy
: The removal of part of a lump or a sample of tissue that doesn’t look normal.
Stages of Childhood Oral Cavity Cancer
Key Points
There is no standard staging system for childhood oral cavity cancer.
There is no standard staging system for childhood oral cavity cancer.
The process used to find out if
cancer
has spread from the
oral cavity
to nearby areas or to other parts of the body is called
staging
. There is no standard
staging system
for childhood
oral cavity cancer
. The results of the
tests and procedures
done to
diagnose
oral cavity cancer are used to help make decisions about treatment.
Sometimes childhood oral cavity cancer
recurs
(comes back) after treatment.
Treatment Option Overview
Key Points
There are different types of treatment for children with oral cavity cancer.
Children with oral cavity cancer should have their treatment planned by a team of doctors who are experts in treating childhood cancer.
Three types of standard treatment are used:
Surgery
Chemotherapy
Radiation therapy
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
Targeted therapy
Treatment for childhood oral cavity cancer may cause side effects.
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
Follow-up tests may be needed.
There are different types of treatment for children with oral cavity cancer.
Some treatments are
standard
(the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in
clinical trials
.  A treatment clinical trial is a
research study
meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the  standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment.
Because cancer in children is rare, taking part in a clinical trial should be considered.  Some clinical trials are open only to patients  who have not started treatment.
Children with oral cavity cancer should have their treatment planned by a team of doctors who are experts in treating childhood cancer.
Treatment will be overseen by a
pediatric oncologist
, a doctor who specializes in treating children with
cancer
. The pediatric oncologist works with other
pediatric
health professionals who are experts in treating children with cancer and who specialize in certain areas of
medicine
. This may include the following
specialists
and others:
Pediatrician
.
Pediatric surgeon
.
Radiation oncologist
.
Pathologist
.
Pediatric ear, nose, and throat specialist.
Pediatric nurse specialist
.
Social worker
.
Rehabilitation specialist
.
Psychologist
.
Child-life specialist
.
Three types of standard treatment are used:
Surgery
Surgery
is the most common treatment for
benign
oral cavity
tumors
and
oral cavity cancer
in children.
Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy
is a cancer treatment that uses
drugs
to stop the growth of cancer
cells
, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or
injected
into a
vein
or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (
systemic chemotherapy
).
Radiation therapy
Radiation therapy
is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy
x-rays
or other types of
radiation
to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing.
External radiation therapy
uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the area of the body with cancer.
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in
clinical trials
. It may not mention every new treatment being studied. 
Information about clinical trials is available from the
NCI website
.
Targeted therapy
Targeted therapy
is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells. Targeted therapy is being studied for the treatment of childhood oral cavity cancer that has
recurred
(come back).
Treatment for childhood oral cavity cancer may cause side effects.
To learn more about
side effects
that begin during treatment for cancer, visit
Side Effects
.
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
For some patients, taking part in a
clinical trial
may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer  treatments are safe and effective or better than the
standard treatment
.
Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first  to receive a new treatment.
Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.
Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the
side effects
of cancer treatment.
Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about clinical trials supported by NCI can be found on NCI’s
clinical trials search
webpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the
ClinicalTrials.gov
website.
Follow-up tests may be needed.
As your child goes through treatment, they will have follow-up tests or check-ups. Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer may be repeated to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.
Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your child's condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back).
