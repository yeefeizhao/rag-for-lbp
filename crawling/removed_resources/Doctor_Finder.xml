Welcome to SIR's Doctor Finder.
Doctor Finder is the most comprehensive database of interventional radiologists practicing in the United States and internationally. Use the search fields on the left side of the screen to search based on geographic location or by state or country. If you already know the name of an IR in your area, you can enter their last name.
Doctor Finder only includes information on those practicing interventional radiologists who are SIR members.
SIR has created this Doctor Finder as a public service to provide access to information on interventional radiologists who are members of SIR. Neither the database, nor any part of the data, listings, profiles, or other constituent elements may be downloaded, republished, or duplicated, in whole or in part, for commercial purposes, purposes of compiling a mailing list or any other list of interventional radiologists, or for any other purposes without the prior express written permission of SIR.
