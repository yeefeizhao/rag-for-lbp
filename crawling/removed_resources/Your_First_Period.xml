Puberty and Periods
Expand All
What is puberty?
Puberty
is a time when your body begins to change to become more like an adult's. Starting your menstrual period is one of these changes.
What is a menstrual period?
When puberty begins, your brain signals your body to produce
hormones
. Some of these hormones prepare your body each month for a possible pregnancy. This is called the menstrual cycle. Hormones cause the lining of the
uterus
to become thicker with extra blood and tissue. One of your
ovaries
then releases an
egg
. This is called
ovulation
. The egg moves down one of the two
fallopian tubes
toward the uterus.
If the egg is not fertilized with a man's
sperm
, pregnancy does not occur. The lining of the uterus breaks down and flows out of the body through your
vagina
. The release of blood and tissue from the lining of your uterus is your menstrual period (also called "your period").
When will I start my period?
Most girls start their periods between the ages of 12 and 13, but some start earlier or later. Your period usually starts about 2 to 3 years after your breasts start to grow.
How long do periods last?
When you first start having your period, it may last only a few days. Your first few periods may be very light. You may only see a few spots of reddish brown blood. Anywhere from 2 to 7 days is normal. If your period lasts for more than 7 days, you should talk with your doctor.
How often will I get my period?
A menstrual cycle is counted from the first day of bleeding in one month to the first day of bleeding in the next month. The average menstrual cycle is about 28 days, but cycles that are 21 to 45 days are also normal. It may take 6 years or more after your period starts for your cycle to get regular.
Why is it a good idea to track my period?
If you track your period every month, you may notice a pattern. It may become easier to tell when you will get your next period. To track your period on a calendar, mark the first day your bleeding starts on a calendar with an "X." Put an X on each of the following days that you have bleeding. Count the first "X" as day 1. Keep counting the days until you have your next period. There are also apps that can help you track your period.

What personal care products are available for me during my menstrual period?
Pads and period underwear are used to soak up the menstrual flow. Tampons and menstrual cups catch the flow from inside your vagina. Pads, period underwear, tampons, and menstrual cups can be used at different times. Some can also be used together.
How are pads used?
Pads are worn inside your underwear to collect your menstrual flow. They come in different sizes, styles, and thicknesses. Some have extra material on the sides called "wings" that fold over the edges of your underwear to help keep the pad in place and give better protection.
A thinner, shorter version of a pad is called a "panty liner." Some girls wear panty liners on the last days of their periods when the flow is light or on days when they think their periods will come.
Choose a pad based on your body size, the amount of flow, and what feels comfortable. Pads with deodorant may irritate your skin.
How often should I change my pad?
Change your pad at least every 4 to 8 hours or whenever it seems full or feels wet and uncomfortable. Some girls change their pads each time they urinate.
What is period underwear?
Period underwear is a type of underwear that absorbs menstrual blood. The underwear has special material sewn into the fabric that soaks up the blood. There are different brands and styles of period underwear with options for heavier or lighter periods. Many styles feel and look like normal underwear.
Period underwear can be bought online and in some stores. They are sometimes called period panties.
How long can I wear period underwear?
You can wear period underwear for a full day. But depending on the underwear and your flow, you may need to change your underwear more often. You can also wear a tampon, pad, or menstrual cup with period underwear for extra protection. Period underwear is washable, similar to normal underwear.
How are tampons used?
Tampons absorb menstrual blood from inside the vagina. Some tampons have a plastic or cardboard applicator tube that helps slide the tampon in place. Some tampons do not have applicators and are inserted with just your fingers.
Follow the directions inside the box to learn how to insert a tampon. It should be comfortable to wear. Once it is inserted correctly, you should not feel it. A short string attached to the end of the tampon hangs out of your vagina to help you remove it later.
Tampons come in different sizes for heavier and lighter periods. The tampon package tells you how much fluid it can absorb. A "super" tampon, for example, is thicker and is meant for heavy flow. A "slim" or "junior" tampon is slender and is meant for lighter flow.
How often should I change my tampon?
You should change your tampon at least every 4 to 8 hours. Leaving a tampon in for a long time has been linked to
toxic shock syndrome
. When your flow is heavier, you may need to change it more often.
What are menstrual cups?
Menstrual cups are made of plastic or rubber. They are inserted into the vagina to catch the menstrual flow. You remove and empty the cup every 8 to 12 hours. Some cups are used only once and thrown away. Others can be washed and reused.
