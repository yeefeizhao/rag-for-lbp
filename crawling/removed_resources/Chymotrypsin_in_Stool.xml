What is a chymotrypsin in stool test?
This test measures the amount of chymotrypsin in a stool sample. Chymotrypsin is an enzyme released by the pancreas during digestion. If lower than normal amounts are released, it may mean your pancreas isn't making enough enzymes to digest your food properly. This is known as
pancreatic insufficiency
.
Pancreatic insufficiency is most often caused by chronic
pancreatitis
, a swelling of the pancreas. It may also be caused by
cystic fibrosis
(CF), a
genetic disorder
that causes mucus to build up in the lungs and other organs, including the pancreas. People with CF often have trouble absorbing nutrients from food.
Your sample may also be tested for trypsin, an enzyme released by the pancreas along with chymotrypsin.
Other names: fecal chymotrypsin, trypsin and chymotrypsin stool test
What is it used for?
A chymotrypsin in stool test is used to help diagnose conditions that affect the pancreas, such as:
Pancreatitis
Cystic fibrosis
Malnutrition
, a condition in which your body does not get the calories,
vitamins
, and/or
minerals
needed for good health
Why do I need a chymotrypsin in stool test?
You may need this test if you have symptoms of a pancreatic disorder. These include:
Chronic
diarrhea
Abdominal pain
Foul-smelling, greasy stools
Weight loss
Frequent
sinus infections
What happens during a chymotrypsin in stool test?
You will need to provide a stool sample. Your health care provider will give you specific instructions on how to collect and send in your sample. Your instructions may include the following:
Put on a pair of rubber or latex gloves.
Collect and store the stool in a special container given to you by your health care provider or a lab. You may get a device or applicator to help you collect the sample.
Make sure no urine, toilet water, or toilet paper mixes in with the sample.
Seal and label the container.
Remove the gloves, and wash your hands.
Return the container to your health care provider or the lab by mail or in person.
Will I need to do anything to prepare for this test?
You don't need any special preparations for a chymotrypsin in stool test.
Are there any risks to this test?
There is no known risk to having a stool test.
What do the results mean?
Your results will show whether the amount of chymotrypsin in your stool is normal or below normal. Your results may also include the amount of trypsin found.
If the amount of chymotrypsin and/or trypsin is below normal, it may mean your pancreas isn't making enough enzymes to digest your food properly. But the test can't diagnose any specific disorders by itself. Your health care provider will need to order more tests. These may include the following, which measure different pancreatic enzymes:
Stool elastase
Lipase blood test
Amylase blood test
If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider.
