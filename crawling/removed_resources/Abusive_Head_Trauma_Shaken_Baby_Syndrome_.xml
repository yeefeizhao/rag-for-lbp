What Is Abusive Head Trauma?
Abusive head trauma is a head or neck injury from physical
child abuse
. It happens when someone shakes a baby or hits the baby against something hard. Most cases happen when a parent or caregiver is angry, tired, or upset because a baby
won't stop crying
or the child can't do something they expect, like toilet train.
These injuries can cause permanent brain damage or death. People should
never shake a baby
for any reason.
Which Children Are at Risk for Abusive Head Trauma?
Most cases of abusive head trauma (also called shaken baby syndrome) happen to babies and toddlers younger than 2 years old. Rarely, it can happen in children up to 5 years old. It can happen to boys or girls in any family.
At special risk for abuse are children who have a lot of special needs or health problems that make them cry a lot, like
colic
and
GER
.
How Does Abusive Head Trauma Happen?
Things like gently bouncing a baby on a knee or riding in a bumpy car won't cause the problems seen in abusive head trauma.
Abusive head trauma happens when someone:
uses force to shake a child
uses force to throw or drop a child on purpose
hits the child's head or neck against an object, like the floor or furniture, or hits the child's head or neck with an object
Shaking a baby is so harmful because:
Infants have poor neck strength and their heads are large compared with the size of their bodies. This lets the head move around a lot when shaken.
When the head moves around, the baby or child's brain moves back and forth inside the skull. This can tear blood vessels and nerves inside or around the brain, causing bleeding and nerve damage.
The brain may hit against the inside of the skull, causing brain bruising and bleeding on the outside of the brain.
Brain swelling builds pressure in the skull. This pressure makes it hard for blood, carrying oxygen and nutrients, to reach the brain, further harming it.
What Are the Signs of Abusive Head Trauma?
In the most severe cases, babies and children may come to the ER, hospital, or doctor's office not awake, having seizures, or in shock.
In less severe cases, a shaken child may:
move less than usual
be cranky and hard to comfort
throw up
have trouble sucking or swallowing
eat less than usual
not smile or coo
seem stiff
have
seizures
have trouble breathing
have skin that looks blue
have pupils (the dark spots in center of the eyes) that aren't the same size
be unable to lift their head
have trouble focusing their eyes or tracking movement
How Is Abusive Head Trauma Diagnosed?
Parents or caregivers often won't say that the child was shaken or hit, so doctors may not know to check for head injury. Many signs of abusive head trauma, like fussiness and throwing up, are common in routine childhood illnesses. So it can be hard for doctors to figure out that a baby was harmed.
If abusive head trauma is suspected, doctors will:
Do an eye exam to look for bleeding inside the eyes.
Order X-rays of all the bones to look for new or healing breaks, which happen most in the arms, legs, skull, and ribs.
Order a
CT
or
MRI
of the head to look for:
broken bones in the head (skull fractures)
brain swelling
brain bleeding
What Can Happen to a Baby With Abusive Head Trauma?
Abusive head trauma often causes life-long harm to the brain and, sometimes, death.
Babies and children who survive may have:
poor eyesight or blindness
hearing loss
seizures
delayed development
problems with speech and learning
problems with memory and focus
cerebral palsy
weakness or problems moving parts of the body
problems with
hormones
controlled by the brain
If a child's problems are mild, they might not be noticed until the child starts school and has problems with learning, focus, or behavior.
What Can Help a Child With Abusive Head Trauma?
After abusive head trauma,a child may need long-term care from a team of health experts, such as:
brain doctors (neurology)
brain surgeons (neurosurgery)
eye doctors (ophthalmology)
hormone doctors (endocrinology)
They also need a pediatrician who can manage their ongoing complex care. They also might need support from therapists, such as:
rehab medicine
speech-language therapy
physical therapy (PT)
occupational therapy (OT)
Before age 3, a child can receive free speech therapy or physical therapy through state-run programs. After age 3, the child's school district's provides any needed special educational services.
As kids get older, they may need special schooling and ongoing help to build language and daily living skills, like dressing.
What Else Should I Know?
Abusive head trauma is 100% preventable. A key part of prevention is increasing awareness of the dangers of shaking:
Tell people caring for your baby to never shake the baby.
Talk about normal crying so a caregiver is less likely to get upset.
Talk about safe ways to
calm a baby
, such as swaddling, rocking, or singing.
Let caregivers know it's OK to put the baby or child in a
safe place
, walk away and take a break.
