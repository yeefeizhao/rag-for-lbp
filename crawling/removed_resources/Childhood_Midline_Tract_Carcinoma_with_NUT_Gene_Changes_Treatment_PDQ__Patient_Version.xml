Key Points
Childhood midline tract carcinoma is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the respiratory tract or other places along the middle of the body.
Midline tract carcinoma is sometimes caused by a change in the
NUT
gene.
The signs and symptoms of midline tract carcinoma are not the same in every child.
Tests that examine the body are used to help diagnose midline tract carcinoma.
Midline tract carcinoma grows and spreads quickly.
Childhood midline tract carcinoma is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the respiratory tract or other places along the middle of the body.
The
respiratory tract
is made up of the nose,
throat
,
larynx
,
trachea
,
bronchi
, and
lungs
.
Midline tract carcinoma
may also form in other places along the middle of the body, such as the
thymus
, the area between the lungs,  the
pancreas
,
liver
, and
bladder

NUT
carcinoma is a rare type of cancer that forms in the respiratory tract or in other places along the middle of the body, including the thymus, the area between the lungs, and the liver, pancreas, and bladder. It usually grows and spreads quickly and cannot be cured.
NUT
carcinoma usually occurs in children and young adults.
Midline tract carcinoma is sometimes caused by a change in the
NUT
gene.
Midline tract carcinoma is caused by a change in a
chromosome
. Every
cell
in the body contains
DNA
(
genetic
material stored inside chromosomes) that controls how the cell looks and acts. Midline tract carcinoma may form when part of the DNA from chromosome 15 (called the
NUT
gene
) joins with the DNA from another chromosome.
The signs and symptoms of midline tract carcinoma are not the same in every child.
The
signs
and
symptoms
of midline tract carcinoma depend on where the
cancer
formed in the body.
Tests that examine the body are used to help diagnose midline tract carcinoma.
The tests used to
diagnose
midline tract carcinoma depend on where the cancer formed in the body and may include the following:
Physical exam
and
health history
: An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patient’s health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.
Chest x-ray
: An
x-ray
of the chest. An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.
MRI
(magnetic resonance imaging)
: A procedure that uses a magnet,
radio waves
, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas of the body, such as the head and neck. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).
CT scan
(CAT scan)
: A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A
dye
may be
injected
into a
vein
or swallowed to help the
organs
or
tissues
show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.
Enlarge
Computed tomography (CT) scan of the head and neck. The child lies on a table that slides through the CT scanner, which takes a series of detailed x-ray pictures of the inside of the head and neck.
Biopsy
: The removal of cells so they can be viewed under a
microscope
by a
pathologist
to check for signs of cancer.
The following tests may be done on the sample of cells that was removed:
Immunohistochemistry
: A
laboratory test
that uses
antibodies
to check for certain
antigens
(
markers
) in a sample of a patient’s tissue. The antibodies are usually linked to an
enzyme
or a fluorescent dye. After the antibodies bind to a specific antigen in the tissue sample, the enzyme or dye is activated, and the antigen can then be seen under a microscope. This type of test is used to help diagnose cancer and to help tell one type of cancer from another type of cancer.
Cytogenetic
analysis
: A laboratory test in which the chromosomes of cells in a sample of
bone marrow
,
blood
,
tumor
, or other tissue are counted and checked for any changes, such as broken, missing, rearranged, or extra chromosomes. Changes in certain chromosomes may be a sign of cancer. Cytogenetic analysis is used to help diagnose cancer, plan treatment, or find out how well treatment is working. Other tests, such as
fluorescence in situ hybridization
(FISH), may also be done to look for certain changes in the chromosomes.
Midline tract carcinoma grows and spreads quickly.
Midline tract carcinoma with
NUT
gene changes is an
aggressive
cancer that cannot be
cured
.
Stages of Childhood Midline Tract Carcinoma
The process used to find out if
cancer
has spread from where it first began to nearby areas or to other parts of the body is called
staging
. There is no standard
staging system
for  childhood
midline tract carcinoma
. The results of the
tests and procedures
done to
diagnose
midline tract carcinoma are used to help make decisions about treatment.
Childhood midline tract carcinoma may spread to the
lymph nodes
, the lining around the
lung
,
bone marrow
, or bone.
Treatment Option Overview
Key Points
There are different types of treatment for children with midline tract carcinoma.
Children with midline tract carcinoma should have their treatment planned by a team of doctors who are experts in treating childhood cancer.
Three types of treatment are used:
Surgery
Radiation therapy
Chemotherapy
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
Targeted therapy
Treatment for childhood midline tract carcinoma may cause side effects.
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
Follow-up tests may be needed.
There are different types of treatment for children with midline tract carcinoma.
Some treatments are
standard
(the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in
clinical trials
.  A treatment clinical trial is a
research study
meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the  standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment.
Because cancer in children is rare, taking part in a clinical trial should be considered.  Some clinical trials are open only to patients  who have not started treatment.
Children with midline tract carcinoma should have their treatment planned by a team of doctors who are experts in treating childhood cancer.
A pediatric oncologist, a doctor who specializes in treating children with cancer, oversees treatment for cancer. The pediatric oncologist works with other health care providers who are experts in treating children with cancer and also specialize in other areas of medicine. Other specialists may include:
pediatrician
pediatric surgeon
radiation oncologist
pathologist
pediatric nurse specialist
social worker
rehabilitation specialist
psychologist
child-life specialist
Three types of treatment are used:
Surgery
Surgery
to remove the
tumor
is one of the main treatments used for childhood
midline tract carcinoma
.
Radiation therapy
Radiation therapy
is a
cancer
treatment that uses high-energy
x-rays
or other types of
radiation
to kill cancer
cells
or keep them from growing.
External radiation therapy
uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the area of the body with cancer.
Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy
is a cancer treatment that uses
drugs
to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or
injected
into a
vein
or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (
systemic chemotherapy
).
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in
clinical trials
. It may not mention every new treatment being studied.
		  Information about clinical trials is available from the
NCI website
.
Targeted therapy
Targeted therapy
is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells. Targeted therapies usually cause less harm to normal cells than chemotherapy or radiation therapy do. New targeted therapy drugs that stop cancer cells from growing are being studied to treat midline tract carcinoma.
Treatment for childhood midline tract carcinoma may cause side effects.
To learn more about
side effects
that begin during treatment for cancer, visit
Side Effects
.
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
For some patients, taking part in a
clinical trial
may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer  treatments are safe and effective or better than the
standard treatment
.
Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first  to receive a new treatment.
Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.
Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the
side effects
of cancer treatment.
Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about clinical trials supported by NCI can be found on NCI’s
clinical trials search
webpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the
ClinicalTrials.gov
website.
Follow-up tests may be needed.
As your child goes through treatment, they will have follow-up tests or check-ups. Some tests that were done to
diagnose
or
stage
the cancer may be repeated to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.
Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your child's condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back).

Childhood Midline Tract Carcinoma with NUT Gene Changes Treatment (PDQ®)–Patient Version
General Information About Childhood Midline Tract Carcinoma
Go to Health Professional Version
Key Points
Childhood midline tract carcinoma is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the respiratory tract or other places along the middle of the body.
Midline tract carcinoma is sometimes caused by a change in the
NUT
gene.
The signs and symptoms of midline tract carcinoma are not the same in every child.
Tests that examine the body are used to help diagnose midline tract carcinoma.
Midline tract carcinoma grows and spreads quickly.
Childhood midline tract carcinoma is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the respiratory tract or other places along the middle of the body.
The
respiratory tract
is made up of the nose,
throat
,
larynx
,
trachea
,
bronchi
, and
lungs
.
Midline tract carcinoma
may also form in other places along the middle of the body, such as the
thymus
, the area between the lungs,  the
pancreas
,
liver
, and
bladder
.

NUT
carcinoma is a rare type of cancer that forms in the respiratory tract or in other places along the middle of the body, including the thymus, the area between the lungs, and the liver, pancreas, and bladder. It usually grows and spreads quickly and cannot be cured.
NUT
carcinoma usually occurs in children and young adults.
Midline tract carcinoma is sometimes caused by a change in the
NUT
gene.
Midline tract carcinoma is caused by a change in a
chromosome
. Every
cell
in the body contains
DNA
(
genetic
material stored inside chromosomes) that controls how the cell looks and acts. Midline tract carcinoma may form when part of the DNA from chromosome 15 (called the
NUT
gene
) joins with the DNA from another chromosome.
The signs and symptoms of midline tract carcinoma are not the same in every child.
The
signs
and
symptoms
of midline tract carcinoma depend on where the
cancer
formed in the body.
Tests that examine the body are used to help diagnose midline tract carcinoma.
The tests used to
diagnose
midline tract carcinoma depend on where the cancer formed in the body and may include the following:
Physical exam
and
health history
: An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patient’s health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.
Chest x-ray
: An
x-ray
of the chest. An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.
MRI
(magnetic resonance imaging)
: A procedure that uses a magnet,
radio waves
, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas of the body, such as the head and neck. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).
CT scan
(CAT scan)
: A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A
dye
may be
injected
into a
vein
or swallowed to help the
organs
or
tissues
show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.

Computed tomography (CT) scan of the head and neck. The child lies on a table that slides through the CT scanner, which takes a series of detailed x-ray pictures of the inside of the head and neck.
Biopsy
: The removal of cells so they can be viewed under a
microscope
by a
pathologist
to check for signs of cancer.
The following tests may be done on the sample of cells that was removed:
Immunohistochemistry
: A
laboratory test
that uses
antibodies
to check for certain
antigens
(
markers
) in a sample of a patient’s tissue. The antibodies are usually linked to an
enzyme
or a fluorescent dye. After the antibodies bind to a specific antigen in the tissue sample, the enzyme or dye is activated, and the antigen can then be seen under a microscope. This type of test is used to help diagnose cancer and to help tell one type of cancer from another type of cancer.
Cytogenetic
analysis
: A laboratory test in which the chromosomes of cells in a sample of
bone marrow
,
blood
,
tumor
, or other tissue are counted and checked for any changes, such as broken, missing, rearranged, or extra chromosomes. Changes in certain chromosomes may be a sign of cancer. Cytogenetic analysis is used to help diagnose cancer, plan treatment, or find out how well treatment is working. Other tests, such as
fluorescence in situ hybridization
(FISH), may also be done to look for certain changes in the chromosomes.
Midline tract carcinoma grows and spreads quickly.
Midline tract carcinoma with
NUT
gene changes is an
aggressive
cancer that cannot be
cured
.
Stages of Childhood Midline Tract Carcinoma
The process used to find out if
cancer
has spread from where it first began to nearby areas or to other parts of the body is called
staging
. There is no standard
staging system
for  childhood
midline tract carcinoma
. The results of the
tests and procedures
done to
diagnose
midline tract carcinoma are used to help make decisions about treatment.
Childhood midline tract carcinoma may spread to the
lymph nodes
, the lining around the
lung
,
bone marrow
, or bone.
Treatment Option Overview
Key Points
There are different types of treatment for children with midline tract carcinoma.
Children with midline tract carcinoma should have their treatment planned by a team of doctors who are experts in treating childhood cancer.
Three types of treatment are used:
Surgery
Radiation therapy
Chemotherapy
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
Targeted therapy
Treatment for childhood midline tract carcinoma may cause side effects.
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
Follow-up tests may be needed.
There are different types of treatment for children with midline tract carcinoma.
Some treatments are
standard
(the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in
clinical trials
.  A treatment clinical trial is a
research study
meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the  standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment.
Because cancer in children is rare, taking part in a clinical trial should be considered.  Some clinical trials are open only to patients  who have not started treatment.
Children with midline tract carcinoma should have their treatment planned by a team of doctors who are experts in treating childhood cancer.
A pediatric oncologist, a doctor who specializes in treating children with cancer, oversees treatment for cancer. The pediatric oncologist works with other health care providers who are experts in treating children with cancer and also specialize in other areas of medicine. Other specialists may include:
pediatrician
pediatric surgeon
radiation oncologist
pathologist
pediatric nurse specialist
social worker
rehabilitation specialist
psychologist
child-life specialist
Three types of treatment are used:
Surgery
Surgery
to remove the
tumor
is one of the main treatments used for childhood
midline tract carcinoma
.
Radiation therapy
Radiation therapy
is a
cancer
treatment that uses high-energy
x-rays
or other types of
radiation
to kill cancer
cells
or keep them from growing.
External radiation therapy
uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the area of the body with cancer.
Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy
is a cancer treatment that uses
drugs
to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or
injected
into a
vein
or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (
systemic chemotherapy
).
New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in
clinical trials
. It may not mention every new treatment being studied.
		  Information about clinical trials is available from the
NCI website
.
Targeted therapy
Targeted therapy
is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells. Targeted therapies usually cause less harm to normal cells than chemotherapy or radiation therapy do. New targeted therapy drugs that stop cancer cells from growing are being studied to treat midline tract carcinoma.
Treatment for childhood midline tract carcinoma may cause side effects.

side effects
that begin during treatment for cancer, visit
Side Effects
.
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
For some patients, taking part in a
clinical trial
may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer  treatments are safe and effective or better than the
standard treatment
.
Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first  to receive a new treatment.
Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.
Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the
side effects
of cancer treatment.
Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about clinical trials supported by NCI can be found on NCI’s
clinical trials search
webpage. Clinical trials supported by other organizations can be found on the
ClinicalTrials.gov
website.
Follow-up tests may be needed.
As your child goes through treatment, they will have follow-up tests or check-ups. Some tests that were done to
diagnose
or
stage
the cancer may be repeated to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.
Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your child's condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back).

About This PDQ Summary
About PDQ
Physician Data Query (PDQ) is the National Cancer Institute's (NCI's) comprehensive cancer information database. The PDQ database contains summaries of the latest published information on cancer prevention, detection, genetics, treatment, supportive care, and complementary and alternative medicine. Most summaries come in two versions. The health professional versions have detailed information written in technical language. The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language. Both versions have cancer information that is accurate and up to date and most versions are also available in
Spanish
.
PDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal government’s center of biomedical research.  The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH.
Purpose of This Summary
This PDQ cancer information summary has current information about the treatment of childhood midline tract carcinoma.  It is meant to inform and help patients, families, and caregivers. It does not give formal guidelines or recommendations for making decisions about health care.
Reviewers and Updates
Editorial Boards write the PDQ cancer information summaries and keep them up to date. These Boards are made up of experts in cancer treatment and other specialties related to cancer. The summaries are reviewed regularly and changes are made when there is new information. The date on each summary ("Updated") is the date of the most recent change.
The information in this patient summary was taken from the health professional version, which is reviewed regularly and updated as needed, by the
PDQ Pediatric Treatment Editorial Board
.
Clinical Trial Information
A clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become "standard." Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
Clinical trials can be found online at
NCI's website
. For more information, call the
Cancer Information Service
(CIS), NCI's contact center, at 1-800-4-CANCER (1-800-422-6237).
