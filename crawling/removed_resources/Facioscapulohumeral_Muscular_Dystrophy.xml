Therapy  
For Facioscapulohumeral
Muscular Dystrophy
1 2The goals of any physical therapy plan of care are to 
help individuals:
n maintain optimum health;
n prevent or delay secondary complications;
n maximize functional abilities; and 
n improve or maintain quality of life.
Depending on the individual’s signs, symptoms, 
and functional abilities, the plan may include 
recommendations about appropriate activities, 
exercises, modalities for pain relief, guidance for 
management of fatigue, orthotics/braces, assistive 
devices, and environmental modifications. 
We emphasize individualized plans of care rather than 
generalized recommendations because FSHD, unlike 
some of the other muscular dystrophies, is a highly 
variable condition. Patients can present with a specific 
combination of muscle involvement and progress at a 
rate that is unique to them. There is extreme variability 
relative to age of onset, degree of weakness, pattern 
of involvement, and rate of progression, even among 
individuals within the same family. 
We hope that this guide will allow you to prepare for 
and make the most of your consultation with a physical 
therapist. Remember that FSHD is a rare condition, 
and unless the therapist is routinely involved in seeing 
patients with muscular dystrophies, the therapist may 
not be familiar with your condition and will appreciate 
any information you can share about FSHD. So please 
share this booklet with your therapist. 
This guide is designed to supplement and complement 
information available from other lay* and professional** 
organizations. We look forward to your feedback to help 
us improve and update our recommendations.

For Facioscapulohumeral 
Muscular Dystrophy
The purpose of this guide is to assist physical 
therapists and individuals with FSHD in 
developing a plan of care based on the best 
research evidence, clinician expertise, and patient 
preferences. T o achieve this goal, individuals and their 
families need to understand the role of physical therapy 
and therapists in the management of individuals with 
FSHD, and for physical therapists to have the latest 
knowledge about FSHD and current management 
recommendations.
 3n inquire about the tests and results that may have 
already been obtained;
n want to know about any other past or current medical 
conditions that may have an impact on your current 
problems;
n note any previous or current medical or surgical 
treatments you have had related to the muscular 
dystrophy or any other concomitant conditions; 
n perform a detailed examination to document the 
muscle involvement, joint involvement, functional 
abilities and limitations, and any problems related to 
pain and/or fatigue. 
After the history and physical examination, the therapist 
may have a further discussion with you regarding 
your current activity status based on your family role, 
occupational needs, or recreational interests. The 
therapist will inquire about your specific goals and will 
develop a plan to meet your exercise and activity needs 
that is compatible with your lifestyle and takes into 
account your daily routines. 
The therapist will demonstrate and teach any specific 
exercises that may be appropriate and give you a 
prescription with specifics about frequency, repetition, 
and duration of exercise and activities. The therapist 
will also describe the symptoms that may require you 
to modify the program and/or seek re-examination, 
and discuss recommendations regarding progression 
of your individualized program. The number and 
frequency of visits necessary will be determined by the 
complexity of the program, your comfort with your own 
role and responsibilities related to the program, and the 
therapist’s need to monitor the program. 
Based on the examination and discussions, the therapist 
may also recommend orthotics/braces, assistive 
devices, and home and workplace modifications to 
allow you to function at your highest capabilities with 
the least expenditure of energy. The therapist may 
also recommend annual evaluations to monitor your 
condition and make appropriate recommendations. Who Are Physical Therapists?
Physical therapists are healthcare professionals who hold 
a graduate professional degree (MPT, DPT). They may 
also be certified specialists in an area such as pediatrics 
(PCS), geriatrics (GCS), neurology (NCS), orthopedics 
(OCS), etc. They are required to have a physical therapy 
(PT) license to practice in each state. They practice in a 
variety of settings including hospitals and nursing homes, 
outpatient clinics, home healthcare, and schools.1
Many individuals with FSHD will probably first encounter 
a physical therapist in the multidisciplinary clinic where 
they receive care for their muscular dystrophy-related 
problems. In this setting, the physical therapist plays 
a consultative role providing evaluation, education, 
instructions, and recommendations based on individual 
patient needs. They may also act as a liaison and help 
coordinate care with school- or community-based 
therapists who may be providing direct care. 
What can you expect when you see  
a physical therapist?
During your initial visit, the therapist will:
n obtain a history to understand the development and 
progression of the problems for which you are being seen;
 CARE RECOMMENDATIONS 
FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH FSHD
An international group of clinicians has 
provided care recommendations based on 
clinical expertise and currently available 
research evidence. These recommendations 
include the following:
1. Individuals with childhood-onset 
FSHD require close monitoring in a 
multidisciplinary clinic.
2. All individuals with FSHD who have 
functional limitations should get an initial 
rehabilitation consultation that includes 
assessment of posture, gait, function, 
balance, and the need for orthoses. 
3. The consultation should also address 
complaints related to pain and fatigue,  
and provide recommendations regarding  
an appropriate exercise regimen that 
includes stretching, strengthening, and 
aerobic training based on the current 
status of the individual and the current 
evidence related to exercise in FSHD.
Facioscapulohumeral  
Muscular Dystrophy (FSHD) 
FSHD is one of the most common forms of inherited 
muscular dystrophy, affecting approximately one 
in 8,000 to one in 15,000 individuals. Children and 
adults of all ages and both genders can be affected. An 
estimated 10 to 30 percent of the cases arise from new 
mutations and, hence, there may not be a family history 
of the disorder. FSHD is almost always an autosomal 
dominant disorder, meaning that an affected individual 
who carries the genetic abnormality that causes FSHD 
has a 50-50 chance of passing the disorder on to each 
offspring. Over the past decade, major advances have 
occurred in our understanding of the genetics and 
molecular mechanisms underlying the condition. For the 
latest review of molecular mechanisms and genetics, 
please consult the “ABOUT FSHD” brochure on the FSH 
Society website at  www.fshsociety.org.

care guidelines summary for patients and clinicians,

Primary Impairments  
4 5
Non-muscular impairments
In addition to muscular involvement, retinal 
abnormalities and high-frequency bilateral sensorineural 
hearing loss are also associated with FSHD. Usually, 
these features are mild and do not cause symptoms. 
However, in the severe, early-onset FSHD, these 
complications, if not detected early, can lead to loss 
of vision in the case of retinal disease and problems 
with speech and cognitive development in the case of 
uncorrected hearing loss. 
Specific Muscular Impairments  
and Recommendations
Facial muscle weakness
Inability to smile and difficulty with articulation 
because of facial muscle weakness remain major 
social concerns. In a small number of individuals, 
difficulty with swallowing has been reported; referral for 
swallowing evaluations is recommended in such cases. 
Weakness of the orbicularis occuli (muscles around the 
eye) can cause incomplete closure of the eyelids during 
sleep, possibly leading to serious exposure keratitis 
and corneal scarring. Eye drops, ointments, taping, or 
patches have been recommended but have not always 
been successful. Surgical insertion of gold weight in 
upper eyelids or a supportive mesh in the lower eyelid 
have also been used with some success.Primary Impairments  
and Recommendations
Muscular impairments
FSHD is among the most common forms of muscular 
dystrophy, affecting children and adults of both sexes. The 
cardinal feature of FSHD is the progressive loss of muscle 
strength. The disease’s name comes from the typical 
pattern of weakness at onset: the face (facio), shoulder 
girdle (scapulo), and upper arms (humeral). However, the 
disease can differ in the typical initial pattern of weakness: 
Not every patient experiences facial muscle loss, and 
many develop muscle weakness in the legs and trunk.
Unlike other muscular dystrophies that present with 
symmetric involvement, asymmetric weakness is very 
common in FSHD. The reason for this pattern is not well 
understood. In the majority of individuals, the weakness 
progresses very slowly, and approximately 20 percent 
eventually end up needing a wheelchair for mobility. 
The most common initial symptom is difficulty reaching 
above shoulder level. Foot drop is a less common 
symptom; such patients, however, almost always have 
asymptomatic scapular fixator and facial weakness 
on examination. T runcal weakness is an early and 
frequent manifestation that is easily overlooked during 
examination of patients. Weak abdominal muscles result 
in a protuberant abdomen and contribute to lumbar 
lordosis. Lower abdominal muscles are weaker than the 
upper abdominal muscles, causing a strikingly positive 
Beevor’s sign, a physical finding fairly specific for FSHD. 
(A Beevor’s sign is seen when a patient flexes the neck 
forward and the navel moves toward the head.)
In addition to muscles of the face, trunk, and extremities, 
muscles related to breathing can be involved in the later 
stages and, hence, regular monitoring of respiratory 
function is recommended in individuals with moderate to 
severe involvement. Unlike some of the other muscular 
dystrophies, cardiac muscle involvement is not present in 
FSHD, but up to 5 percent of individuals with FSHD may 
manifest atrial arrhythmias.  6and/or work. It is best to start the discussion regarding 
orthotic needs sooner rather than later and to see, 
experience, and discuss the pros and cons of the various 
options before making a decision. 
Pelvic girdle muscle weakness
Involvement of the muscles around the hip can lead 
to difficulties with getting up from a seated position, 
negotiating stairs, and can make walking long distances 
difficult and time consuming. At this stage, an individual 
may want to consider using a scooter for outdoor mobility.
Secondary Impairments  
and Recommendations 
Pain
Pain is a common complaint in individuals with FSHD. 
Depending on the survey, 70 to 90 percent of individuals 
report pain. The intensity and frequency vary and are 
often attributed to exertion or faulty posture secondary 
to weakness. As mentioned previously, the muscle 
involvement and weakness in FSHD are quite unique, 
leading to muscle imbalances and uneven tension across 
Scapular muscle weakness
Scapular muscle weakness and difficulty with overhead 
activities are a major problem. In addition, the weakness 
can lead to pain and fatigue. Severe weakness can cause 
persistent drooping of the shoulders. If severe enough, 
this can produce traction on the brachial plexus, a group 
of nerves in the shoulder/armpit region that supplies 
the arm. Sometimes this can stretch the nerves severely 
enough that they can be damaged, producing tingling/
numbness, cramps, and further weakness. 
The force necessary to keep the scapula stabilized 
has made the use of taping, slings, and spinal orthosis 
difficult. “Figure 8” braces for the upper back used for 
short periods of time have anecdotally provided pain 
relief and greater ease with specific activities. Surgical 
procedures may be considered, such as a well-known 
and tried technique called scapular fixation. 
Abdominal muscle weakness
Weak abdominal muscles result in a protuberant abdomen 
and contribute to lumbar lordosis and complaints of 
backache and fatigue. Unfortunately, given the marked 
weakness, it is difficult to strengthen the abdominal 
muscles; thus, external supports such as abdominal 
binders and appropriate back supports are recommended.
Ankle muscle weakness
“Foot drop” (difficulty lifting the front part of the foot) 
caused by ankle dorsiflexor weakness is a common 
problem. Individuals may first notice problems  
when walking outdoors on uneven surfaces or when 
negotiating curbs and steps. 
The benefits of specific types of ankle braces or 
ankle-foot orthoses (AFOs) and the correct timing 
for intervention have not been well studied. The 
recommendation regarding orthotic use remains very 
individualized, since it needs to take into consideration 
the pattern and severity of weakness; the type, intensity, 
and duration of activities in which the individual is 
involved; and any environmental factors related to home  7
Exercise Recommendations 
Individuals with FSHD often have questions about 
exercise. Exercises including flexibility/range of motion, 
strengthening/resistive, and cardiovascular/aerobic 
exercise are important for the management of the 
musculoskeletal manifestations of FSHD and for the 
overall health and fitness of the individual. More recently, 
the importance of neuromotor training, functional 
exercise, and balance training have also been recognized 
and recommended by the American College of Sports 
Medicine (ACSM).
The evidence available regarding the role of exercise in 
FSHD is limited. In extensive reviews on the topic published 
in 2010 and 2013, the authors examined the safety and 
efficacy of strength and aerobic training in neuromuscular 
diseases using randomized controlled trials (RCT s). They 
identified one study in which the benefits of six (6) months 
of exercise followed by an additional six (6) months of 
medication (albuterol) versus placebo were examined in 65 
individuals with FSHD. Based on the findings of the study, 
the authors concluded that moderate-intensity strength 
training does no harm, but there is insufficient evidence 
that it offers benefits. In a 2007 review, evidence related 
to exercise in individuals with neuromuscular diseases 
was evaluated. Based on their analysis of the studies, 
the researchers concluded that the evidence suggests 
strengthening exercises in combination with aerobic 
exercises are “likely to be effective.” joints. A good example is back pain secondary to the 
abdominal muscle weakness and lordosis of the spine. 
Pain has a major impact on the quality of life of 
individuals with FSHD. The exact mechanisms 
underlying the reports of pain are not well understood, 
and neither is the natural history of pain. For example, it 
is not well understood whether pain worsens with age or 
is associated with severity of weakness, strenuousness 
of activity, type of activity, etc.
T o effectively manage this symptom, it is essential 
to understand the location, nature, duration, and the 
activities and environmental factors that worsen or 
ease the pain. A wide variety of methods have been 
used to treat pain in individuals with FSHD. The use of 
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications, exercise 
(strengthening and range of motion), heat, and massage 
are the most common therapies used to manage pain. 
Fatigue
As many as 60 to 90 percent of individuals with FSHD 
report problems with fatigue, often with negative 
impacts on function and quality of life. Like pain, 
the exact mechanisms underlying fatigue are not 
well understood, and the natural history is not well 
documented. Pain itself can cause fatigue.
In a recent report of a randomized controlled trial from 
the Netherlands, clinicians found that moderate aerobic 
exercise combined with cognitive behavioral therapy 
(CBT) reduces chronic fatigue. CBT is tailored to each 
individual to challenge negative patterns of thought in 
order to alter unwanted behavior patterns.
Imbalance
Due to muscle weakness, individuals with FSHD develop 
poor balance, which increases the risk of falling. Fear 
of falling may lead to restricted activity and decreased 
quality of life. PT can improve balance and make 
recommendations to reduce falls, and thereby enhance 
quality of life. 8
It is often helpful for individuals to maintain a daily log of 
activities of daily living, work-related activities, specific 
exercises performed, and symptoms experienced on 
the following day. By documenting physical tasks (both 
routine and exercise) along with physical well-being 
(including pain and fatigue), individuals with FSHD will 
be able to provide proper feedback to the therapist 
supervising the individualized program.
Aerobic, flexibility, and strengthening 
exercises
Moderate-intensity aerobic exercises are activities that 
can be performed while still continuing a conversation—
without having to stop to catch your breath. Examples 
include walking briskly, biking on level ground or on a 
stationary bicycle, using hand cycles, ballroom and line 
dancing, lawn mowing, snow shoveling, and general 
gardening and household activities. Strengthening 
exercise can be performed in several ways—with 
resistance provided by gravity, water in a pool, or with 
equipment such as elastic bands, free weights, and 
machines. Y oga and Pilates types of exercises may also 
be recommended as part of a strengthening program, 
although there are no studies reported that have 
examined the effects of these specific interventions in 
individuals with FSHD.
Flexibility/range of motion (ROM) exercises are 
important in maintaining joint function and may play 
a role in reducing pain that is caused by muscular Exercise: how much?
Given the evidence from the two (2) major reviews that 
exercise may be effective and that moderate-intensity 
exercise does not worsen disease progression, some 
general recommendations regarding exercise can be 
made to guide clinicians and individuals with FSHD 
using the current physical activity guidelines from the 
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). 
(See www.health.gov/paguidelines. ) 
These suggest that for all individuals, some activity is 
better than none, and that the health benefits of physical 
activity far outweigh the risks. The guidelines recommend 
that children, adolescents, adults (ages 18-64), and older 
adults follow the appropriate guidelines to the best of their 
ability. Individuals with chronic conditions perform as 
much activity and/or exercise as their condition allows. 
The HHS guidelines recommend about two (2) hours 
and 30 minutes each week of moderate-intensity aerobic 
exercise. The exercise can be spread out in 30-minute 
sessions five (5) times per week or even in episodes of 
at least 10 minutes three (3) times per day, preferably 
spread throughout the week. Muscle strengthening 
activities that involve all major muscle groups should be 
performed at least two to three (2-3) days a week. 
A personalized program, baseline  
measures, and a daily log
Prior to beginning an exercise program, individuals 
should undergo baseline measures of strength and 
exercise capacity, provide a comprehensive description 
of their daily activities related to personal care, 
household duties, and work-related requirements. 
They should also share their preferred leisure activities 
and personal goals they would like to achieve. Based 
on all this information, a personalized program can 
be developed. The personal program should not only 
include instructions about the type of exercise, but 
also information about repetitions, intensity, duration, 
and guidance about signs and symptoms related to 
overwork, how much to cut back, and how to progress.  many muscles can be exercised at the same time. On a 
practical basis, however, adults may avoid hydrotherapy 
because of accessibility, safety issues, or social concerns.
Neuromuscular electrical stimulation
The use of neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) 
has been studied for decades in individuals with muscular 
dystrophies and other chronic conditions causing atrophy 
and weakness. The goal has been to prevent disuse 
atrophy in those unable to exercise actively. 
An open, pilot study of NMES in nine (9) individuals 
with FSHD who underwent stimulation of the deltoid, 
trapezius, and quadriceps muscles five (5) days per 
week for five (5) months reported increases in strength 
and in the 6-minute walk test. The authors concluded 
that the use of NMES appears to be safe, feasible, 
and well tolerated, but requires further study with 
multicenter randomized controlled trials. imbalance or tightness. As muscles atrophy, resulting 
in weakness, gravitational pull may limit a person’s 
ability to move a body part through its entire range of 
motion. For example, as the dorsiflexors at the ankle 
become weaker while the plantarflexor remains stronger, 
an imbalance is created at the ankle, resulting in a 
tendency to develop tightness and loss of ankle range 
of motion. Another example: Due to the weakness of 
the shoulder stabilizers, overhead activities become 
difficult and individuals have difficulty raising their arms 
in a sitting or standing position but may have the ability 
to perform this movement when lying down in a supine 
position where gravity is eliminated. 
Current recommendations regarding flexibility/ROM 
exercises are that they be done daily or at least three 
(3) times a week. If tightness has already developed, a 
gentle stretch should be maintained for 10 to 30 seconds 
and the exercise repeated two to four (2 to 4) times. 
Stretching should be performed when the muscles are 
warmed up, either after cardiorespiratory exercise or 
after a bath or use of a hot pack. Individuals may also 
participate in flexibility exercises that are more dynamic 
in nature. These include yoga- and Pilates-based activity 
that can either be done individually or in a class setting. 
Weakness occurs as part of the disease process; 
however, weakness may also develop as a result 
of disuse. Exercises may help minimize the disuse 
weakness, but there is also a concern that too much 
exercise or inappropriate exercise may hasten or worsen 
weakness and, therefore, finding the right balance of 
exercises for each individual is important. 
Hydrotherapy (aquatic/water therapy) 
There have been no controlled trials studying the effects 
of hydrotherapy in FSHD. Physical therapists encourage 
hydrotherapy in all types of muscular dystrophy because 
water can be used to assist as well as resist movements, 
is a fun medium for younger individuals to exercise in, 
and the warmth and buoyancy can be relaxing. Also, 
hydrotherapy can be an efficient means of exercise, as 
9
 The therapist seeing a patient with FSHD for the first 
time must begin by gathering information regarding the 
person’s occupation, leisure activities, and role as a 
parent or caregiver to another person. This should involve 
detailed questioning of the patient’s job description, hours 
at work, responsibilities of keeping a house or apartment, 
childcare, pet care, and any other regular physical tasks. It 
is necessary for the therapist to have a clear sense of the 
percent of time each day the person with FSHD spends 
sitting at a computer, standing, walking, climbing stairs, 
getting into and out of a vehicle, doing laundry, preparing 
meals, walking a dog, carrying a toddler, etc.
A detailed strength evaluation should then follow. 
T ypically, as this is completed, the therapist has become 
aware of significant muscle imbalances. Very weak 
muscles are often overstretched. Strong muscles may be 
tight, but again, are probably not producing significant 
contractures. 
The person with FSHD almost inevitably is suffering 
from chronic pain. The areas most often affected are the 
cervical area, the upper back, the lower back, and the 
posterior knee. The areas of pain will correspond with 
the weakest (and thus overstretched) muscles. 
Treatment of pain
Ask the patient to keep an activity log for at least several 
weeks. This can be as detailed as the patient needs it 
10For Physical Therapists
Providing physical therapy for the patient with FSHD 
introduces special challenges for the therapist. 
More than other muscular dystrophies, FSHD can 
be quite asymmetrical. For example, it is not unusual  
to grade a muscle on one side as a 4 or above by MMT 
and the corresponding muscle on the other side as a  
1 or 2 grade. 
There often appears to be no rhyme or reason to the 
specific muscle group strengths. However, there are 
usually some predictive patterns:
n The upper and lower abdominals are among the first 
muscle groups to show clinical weakness and are 
rarely graded above a 3.
n The middle and lower trapezius and serratus anterior 
muscles also weaken early and are rarely above a 3 
grade. The middle deltoid, however, usually is only 
mildly weakened. 
n Shoulder external rotators are weaker than shoulder 
internal rotators.
n Biceps brachii is usually preferentially involved. 
n Knee flexors are weaker than knee extensors.
n Ankle dorsiflexors are weaker than ankle plantar 
flexors. 
n Despite, on occasion, radical strength imbalances 
between a muscle antagonist and agonist, significant 
joint contractures are rare.
Because this autosomal dominant disease is slowly 
progressive, and perhaps because other members of the 
family may also have “toughed it out” with symptoms 
for many years, patients sometimes are not referred to 
a physical therapist until they have endured decades of 
chronic pain, weakness, and disability.By Wendy King, PT, Ohio State University 11to be, but at minimum, it should have columns for the 
type of activity, the time of day (15 minutes to blocks of 
several hours), and symptoms noticed. If the person is 
accurate and thorough, such a log may well provide very 
useful information concerning the correspondence of 
some specific activities and symptoms of fatigue or pain. 
T reatment of the pain should include instruction for 
any appropriate stretching or strengthening exercises, 
evaluation for possible bracing (especially to assist in 
ankle dorsiflexion, scapular retraction, or to provide 
abdominal support), and modalities such as moist heat, 
cold, TENS, massage, acupuncture, etc. Medication may 
also be required. 
The use of lightweight, off-the-shelf, or custom-made 
ankle-foot orthoses (AFOs) works well to correct foot 
drop. The new stance-control knee-ankle-foot orthoses 
(KAFOs) may benefit a minority of FSHD adults who have 
significant quadriceps weakness (especially unilaterally) 
or those who present with knee pain due to chronic 
genu recurvatum caused by an imbalance between 
knee flexors that are weaker than extensors. The type of 
stance-control orthosis that has double uprights at the 
ankle usually benefits an individual with FSHD in terms  
of increased stability and decreased fatigue. 
Most importantly, the therapist must teach the individual 
with FSHD strategies to avoid the cycle of chronic 
musculoskeletal pain. This includes education of any 
postural deficiencies and ways to minimize them, an 
honest appraisal of the individual’s lifestyle—both 
leisure and work—and suggestions for alterations that 
might result in less emphasis on the weakest muscles. 
Suggestions could be as simple as trying certain adaptive 
equipment for bathing, dressing, or housekeeping at 
home, or a more supportive or height-appropriate desk 
chair, or ergonomically correct keyboard and mouse for  
a laptop or computer station at work. 
Even if individuals choose not to use a recommended 
orthotic device or adaptive equipment, they need to 
understand the principle behind the recommendation. References

T oo often, we hear people say they’ll volunteer when 
there’s a treatment. But that day will never arrive unless 
patients participate in research now. 
Equally important are family members, both affected 
and unaffected. Comparing a parent or sibling who has 
very mild symptoms with a person who has more severe 
symptoms could provide insight for future treatments. 
Ironically, the mildly affected and unaffected are least 
likely to volunteer for research, yet they may hold the key 
to a treatment.
By volunteering for research, you will help move us a 
step closer to a breakthrough.
