1. How Do I Tell My Mom or Dad That I Got My First Period?
It's normal to feel a little shy about sharing this bit of news. In some families, talking about body stuff might seem like no big deal. With this kind of family, they might take you out to dinner to celebrate your period!
Other families might be more private, so it can be hard to know exactly what to say or whom to tell.
But this news needs to be shared, at least with one grown-up in the family. You might just pull the person aside and say it clearly, like this: "I got my
first period
today. Do you think you can help me get some supplies?"
If brothers and sisters find out, they might tease you a bit. Just tell them that it means you're getting older.
2. How Does a Tampon Work?
Unlike
pads
, which catch blood after it comes out of the vagina, a
tampon
is put in the vagina. It's made of soft material with a string for easy removal. The opening to the vagina is between the urethra (where pee comes out) and the anus (where poop comes out).
It may take a little time to get the hang of using tampons. Tampon applicators can be plastic or cardboard, and you can use whichever one you like better. Inside each box, there's an instruction booklet that will tell you how to put a tampon in.
Tampons come in different absorbencies. Try starting with light or regular and then switching if you need to. You should change your tampon every 4 to 8 hours or when it's filled with blood.
If a tampon ever does feel "stuck," don't panic. It can't get lost inside you because there's no way out except through the vagina. Relax and wait a few minutes, and then you should be able to get the tampon out.

3. Can I Go Swimming During My Period?
Swimming during your period isn't a problem. However, you will want to use a tampon (not a pad) when swimming so you don't bleed on your swimsuit. Pads won't work and will just fill with water. The tampon won't fall out if it was put in correctly, so go ahead and make a splash!
Tampons also can be helpful for girls who exercise or play sports during their periods. Pads will work, but can feel uncomfortable during sports.
4. What Happens if I Don't Have Pads or Tampons Handy?
If this happens, here are your options: Borrow from a friend, buy some from a restroom dispenser, visit the school nurse
if you're at school
, or call home so your mom or dad can bring you what you need. If you're desperate and trying to keep your clothes from staining, you can fold up some tissues or toilet paper and place them in your underwear. That won't work for long, so you'll need to get some pads or tampons quickly.
If you're nervous about telling the school nurse, a teacher, or another adult about what you need, write it down on a piece of paper or use code words. You might say that "it's that time of the month" or that you need some "personal supplies." Even better, keep extras in your backpack, locker, or gym bag.
5. What if Blood Leaks Through My Undies and Pants?
Oh, no! There's blood on the back of your pants — what do you do? It happens to just about every girl at some point. Sometimes it happens when you aren't at home, so you can't change right away. But if you're wearing a sweater or jacket, you can take it off and tie it around your waist. Then get a fresh tampon or pad so that it doesn't bleed through your pants more than it already has.
Change as soon as you can. You'll need to rinse your underwear and pants with cold water as soon as possible. Sometimes, the stain comes out and sometimes it doesn't. To avoid this problem, change your pads and tampons regularly and keep extras in your backpack or locker.
For extra protection on heavy days, some girls use a tampon and wear a pad or absorbent period underwear. You also might want to wear dark-colored underwear and pants during your period.
