Stroke causes severe
life-changing
disruption.
Together, we can
      disrupt stroke.
Stroke, a leading cause of death, can take away your ability to talk, walk, and think clearly. Stroke can happen to anyone—even if you’re young. Let’s disrupt this disruptor with prevention, treatment, and research.

Stroke is a medical emergency. About 80% are ischemic stokes,
        which cut off blood to the brain. The rest are hemorrhagic strokes,
        caused by bleeding in or around the brain. The longer blood flow is cut
        off, the greater the damage. Getting to a hospital quickly saves lives
         and increases the chances for successful recovery.

Special Feature
Nobody can reduce your risk
      like you.
Everyone is at risk for stroke and dementia. But if you’re a Black
        man 28-45, you have a higher risk. Many years before stroke or
        dementia happen, uncontrolled high blood pressure narrows your
        arteries, decreasing blood to your brain. Take charge of your
        health!
