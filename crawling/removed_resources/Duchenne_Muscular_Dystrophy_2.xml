most common  form of muscular dystrophy. 
It is a genetic disorder characterized by 
progressive weakness  
and degeneration of the skeletal muscles that 
control movement.
Duchenne affects approximately 1 in 
5,000 live male births . It is estimated that 
about 20,000 children are diagnosed  with 
Duchenne globally each year.
DMD is classified as a dystrophinopathy, 
a muscle disease  that results from the 
deficiency of a protein  called dystrophin.
In Duchenne, a mutation in the DMD 
gene  interferes with the production of the 
dystrophin protein, which is needed to form 
and maintain healthy muscle. Lack of the 
dystrophin protein in muscle cells causes 
them to be fragile and easily damaged .Because the DMD gene is located on the 
X-chromosome, it primarily affects males, 
while females typically are carriers.  
However, some females can experience 
varying degrees of physical Duchenne 
symptoms and are therefore called 
manifesting carriers.
DMD typically is inherited through the 
mother;  however, in about 25% of cases, the 
disease occurs spontaneously in people who 
do not have a family history of DMD.
There is no cure for DMD, but medications 
and therapy can help manage some 
symptoms and potentially slow the course of 
the disease.What is...

Dystrophy A 
Guide for 
Individuals 
and Families
 A small percentage of boys with DMD 
have some degree of learning 
disability, including problems in three 
general areas: attention focusing, 
verbal learning and memory, and 
emotional interaction.
4
Muscle weakness worsens with age 
and progresses to the arms, legs, 
and trunk.
5
Beginning at about 10 years of age, 
the diaphragm and other muscles 
that operate the lungs may weaken, 
making the lungs less effective at 
moving air in and out. Signs of poor 
respiratory function can include 
headaches, difficulty concentrating or 
staying awake, and nightmares.
7Weakened respiratory muscles make 
it difficult to cough, leading to 
increased risk of serious respiratory 
infection. A simple cold can quickly 
progress to pneumonia.
9
While disease progression varies, 
boys, on average, lose their ability to 
walk, and transition to fulltime 
wheelchair use at age 12.
6Heart and respiratory muscle 
problems begin in the teen years and 
can lead to serious complications.
8 
Thanks to advances in cardiac and 
respiratory care, life expectancy for 
individuals with DMD is increasing 
and many young adults with DMD 
attend college, have careers, get 
married, and have children.
10
Survival into the early 30s is 
becoming more common, and there 
are cases of men with DMD living 
into their 40s and 50s.
11What are the signs and symptoms of DMD?
DMD is a multi-systemic condition affecting many parts of the body and resulting in atrophy of the 
skeletal, cardiac (heart), and pulmonary (lung) muscles.

What should I know about DMD?
Early signs of Duchenne may include 
delayed ability to sit, stand, or walk, 
and difficulties learning to speak. 
Muscle weakness usually begins in 
the hips, pelvic area, upper legs, and 
shoulders. The calves may be 
enlarged.
2DMD symptom onset occurs in early 
childhood, usually between the ages 
of 3 and 5 years.
1
Children with DMD typically develop 
an unusual walk and difficulty 
running and climbing stairs. Some 
will have problems getting up from 
the floor and may use a distinctive 
method known as Gower’s maneuver 
or Gower’s sign to “walk” their hands 
up their thighs in order to stand up. 
DMD may also affect learning and 
memory, as well as communication 
and certain emotional skills.
3 How is DMD treated?
Physical therapy through exercise 
helps to restore and maintain muscle 
strength and function. Stretching 
helps to maintain range of motion.
Braces, also called orthoses, support the 
ankle and foot or may extend up over 
the knee. Ankle-foot orthoses (AFOs) 
are sometimes prescribed for night 
wear to keep the foot from pointing 
downward and keep the Achilles tendon 
stretched while a child is sleeping.
Occupational therapy can help improve 
daily living and work skills.
Assisted ventilation can help treat 
respiratory muscle weakness.  
 
Educational and psychological 
interventions can help with 
learning disabilities.Corrective orthopedic surgery, 
including spine-straightening 
surgery, may help make sitting, 
sleeping, and breathing more 
comfortable.
Treatment with angiotensin converting 
enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and beta 
blockers may be used to slow the course 
of cardiac muscle deterioration in DMD.
Exondys 51 * is an “exon skipping” 
drug that targets a section of DNA 
called exon 51. It is approved by the 
FDA for treatment of individuals who 
have a confirmed mutation of the DMD 
gene that is amenable to a therapeutic 
strategy called exon 51 skipping and 
may help up to 13% of individuals with 
DMD. 
Emflaza * is the only corticosteroid that 
has been approved by the US Food and 
Drug Administration for the treatment of 
Duchenne in individuals 2 years of age 
and older.
Vyondys 53*  is an “exon skipping” drug 
that targets a section of DNA called 
exon 53. It is approved by the FDA for treatment of individuals who have a 
confirmed mutation of the DMD gene 
that is amenable to a therapeutic 
strategy called exon 53 skipping and 
may help up to 8% of individuals with 
DMD.
Viltepso*  is an “exon skipping” drug that 
targets a section of DNA called exon 53. 
It is approved by the FDA for treatment 
of individuals who have a confirmed 
mutation of the DMD gene that is 
amenable to a therapeutic strategy 
called exon 53 skipping and may help up 
to 8% of individuals with DMD.
Corticosteroids (such as 
prednisone) are commonly 
used in DMD to help preserve 
muscle strength and function, 
to prevent scoliosis, and to 
prolong the time that people with 
DMD can walk. It’s thought that 
steroids work, at least in part, by 
reducing inflammation. However, 
corticosteroids also cause 
unwanted side effects such as 
increased appetite, weight gain, 
loss of bone mass, and cataracts.
