What is
shaken baby
syndrome?
Shaken baby syndrome is a type of brain injury that happens when a baby or young child is shaken violently. When this happens, the brain can bounce back and forth against the skull which can cause bleeding, bruising, and swelling.
Shaken baby syndrome is known to cause long-term brain damage or even death. Symptoms of shaken baby syndrome may include:
Bleeding, bruising, or swelling in the brain
Bleeding in the retina (a part of the eye)
Unconsciousness
Seizures
Breathing difficulties
Extreme irritability
Vomiting
Pale or blue-colored skin
Some symptoms may be noticed immediately while others become evident as the child grows older. Babies and young children who have been shaken violently may develop serious health problems, including:
Permanent brain damage
Vision problems and possibly loss of sight
Problems with body movement and movement control
Weakness
Seizures
Abnormal physical sensations or perceptions
Neck and spinal cord damage
Intellectual disability
Doctors can use imaging tests like magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) to diagnose the disorder. Treatment must be given quickly and some children may need surgery to stop bleeding in the body or machines to help them breathe.
