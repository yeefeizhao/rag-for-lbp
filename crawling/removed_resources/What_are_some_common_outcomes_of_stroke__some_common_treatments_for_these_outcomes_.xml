<page><title>What are some common outcomes of stroke &amp; some common treatments for these outcomes?</title><url>https://www.nichd.nih.gov/health/topics/stroke/conditioninfo/treatment</url><content>Recovery from a stroke may take months or years. Many people who have had a stroke never fully recover.
A person who has had a stroke may have the following temporary or permanent symptoms:
Inability to move on one side of the body
Weakness on one side of the body
Problems with thinking, awareness, attention, learning, judgment, and memory
Problems understanding or forming speech
Problems with controlling or expressing emotions
Numbness or strange sensations
Pain in the hands and feet that worsens with movement and temperature changes
Depression
Types of Treatment for Stroke
Stroke treatment includes:
Emergency treatment
Preventing another stroke
Rehabilitation
Emergency Treatment
When a person is able to get to the hospital within a few hours of having a stroke, health care providers will treat a stroke with medications, surgery, or both, depending on the type of stroke.
Medication for Ischemic Stroke
Thrombolytic
agents
These medications are used to treat an ongoing ischemic stroke caused by a blocked artery. They stop the stroke by dissolving the blood clot that has blocked blood flow to the brain.
Blood-thinning medications
These drugs include antiplatelet drugs and anticoagulants and work to prevent blood clotting that causes ischemic stroke.
Surgery
In the case of ischemic stroke, a surgeon can clear out the clogged artery to allow blood to resume flowing to the affected part of the brain. Surgery can also repair structural abnormalities in arteries in the case of hemorrhagic stroke.
Preventing Another Stroke
A patient who has had a stroke may continue taking blood-thinning medications, referred to as blood thinners, to prevent another stroke. Surgery performed to treat a stroke may also help to prevent another stroke. Health care providers will also advise stroke survivors to make lifestyle changes, such as eating a healthy diet, exercising, and treating related medical conditions.

Rehabilitation
Stroke is the leading cause of serious adult disability in the United States. Several types of therapies can help a stroke survivor regain some or all of the functions damaged by the stroke. These therapies include:
Physical therapy
A physical therapist uses training and exercises to help a patient relearn physical activities such as walking, sitting, standing, and lying down. A special type of physical therapy called constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT) can improve the use of a weakened or paralyzed arm. CIMT involves training and exercise for the affected arm while the unaffected arm is restrained by a special mitt.
Occupational therapy
Occupational therapy involves exercise and training to help a patient relearn daily activities such as eating, drinking, dressing, bathing, cooking, reading, writing, and using a toilet.
Speech therapy
Speech therapy helps patients relearn language and speaking, including swallowing.
Psychological therapy
Stroke survivors may suffer from depression, anxiety, frustration, and anger. Talk therapy, medications, or both can treat these symptoms.
