Also called: Intracerebral Hemorrhage, Subarachnoid Hemorrhage
Summary
A
stroke
is a medical emergency. There are two types -
ischemic
and hemorrhagic. Hemorrhagic stroke is the less common type. It happens when a blood vessel breaks and bleeds into the brain. Within minutes, brain cells begin to die. Causes include a bleeding
aneurysm
, an
arteriovenous malformation
(AVM), or an artery wall that breaks open.
Symptoms of stroke are:
Sudden numbness or weakness of the face, arm or leg (especially on one side of the body)
Sudden confusion, trouble speaking or understanding speech
Sudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes
Sudden trouble walking, dizziness, loss of balance or coordination
Sudden severe headache with no known cause
It is important to treat strokes as quickly as possible. With a hemorrhagic stroke, the first steps are to find the cause of bleeding in the brain and then control it.  Surgery may be needed.
Post-stroke rehabilitation
can help people overcome disabilities caused by stroke damage.
