# Journal Articles

This directory contains peer-reviewed research articles about lower back pain interventions, treatments, and evidence-based approaches.

## Overview

These scholarly articles provide the research foundation for understanding effective lower back pain management strategies. They are used to supplement clinical practice guidelines with the latest research findings.

## Articles Included

### `crowe_et_al.pdf`
Research article by Crowe and colleagues examining lower back pain interventions, treatment outcomes, or evidence synthesis. This likely represents original research or systematic review work.

### `geraghty_et_al.pdf`
Peer-reviewed study by Geraghty et al. investigating aspects of lower back pain diagnosis, treatment, or patient outcomes. May focus on specific therapeutic approaches or clinical trial results.

### `kongsted_et_al.pdf`
Research paper by Kongsted and colleagues, likely addressing treatment effectiveness, patient stratification, clinical prediction rules, or comparative effectiveness research in lower back pain management.

### `support_back_in_action.pdf`
Supporting materials or research evidence for the "Back in Action" program, which likely represents a comprehensive back pain management intervention or patient education initiative.

### `yang_et_al.pdf`
Scholarly article by Yang et al. contributing to the evidence base on lower back pain, potentially covering topics such as risk factors, treatment modalities, systematic reviews, or meta-analyses.

## Purpose

These journal articles serve multiple purposes in the RAG system:

1. **Evidence Base**: Provide scientific support for treatment recommendations
2. **Current Research**: Incorporate latest findings into patient education materials
3. **Treatment Efficacy**: Document effectiveness of various interventions
4. **Best Practices**: Inform evidence-based care recommendations
5. **Patient Outcomes**: Include data on treatment success rates and patient experiences

## Usage in the Project

The articles are processed through the following workflow:

1. **Text Extraction**: PyPDF2 extracts text content from PDFs
2. **XML Conversion**: Content is converted to structured XML format
3. **Integration**: Combined with clinical guidelines and health education materials
4. **Retrieval**: Made searchable within the RAG system
5. **Citation**: Source information preserved for reference
