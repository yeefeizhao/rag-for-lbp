Last guideline approval : March 2021  
 
  
Guidelines  are systematically developed statements to assist patients and providers in choosing 
appropriate health care for specific clinical conditions. While guidelines are useful aids to assist providers 
in determining appropriate practices for many patients with specific clinical problems or prevention issues, 
guidelines are not meant to replace the clinical judgment of the individual provider or establish a standard 
of care. The recommendations contained in the guidelines may not be appropriate for use in all circumstances. The inclusion of a recommendation in a guideline does not imply coverage. A decision to 
adopt any particular recommendation must be made by the provider in light of the circumstances presented by the individual patient.

 Changes as of March 2021  
This updated 2021 guideline has only minor differences from the previous (2017) version. The evidence 
review identified no newly published high -quality studies that would change our current  recommendations.  
Background  
Back pain is a common condition that has significant impact s on patients’ function and quality of life. 
Clinical approaches to back pain vary considerably among providers. This guideline is intended to help 
primary care teams do an effective initial assessment of back pain, select appropri ate interventions to 
maximize the patient’s function and quality of life, and minimize the use of unnecessary and potentially 
harmful interventions.   
Key points about back pain  
• Most people experience back pain in their lifetime . 
• Most back pain is “non- specific ,” with no  specific  identifiable spinal cause.  
• Back pain caused by serious or urgent (“red flag”)  conditions  is infrequent . 
• For most patients with back pain, the condition will improve within a few days or weeks . In the 
absence of red flag conditions requiring immediate referral and treatment, the initial approach to 
back pain should include evaluation with the STarT Back, foll owed by reassurance, 
encouragement to stay active, emphasis on restoring function, and simple analgesics as needed.  
• Psychosocial factors are stronger predictors of prognosis than clinical factors.  
• Biomedical interventions commonly used to evaluate and treat back pain—such as imaging, 
medications, and epidural steroid injections —have been found to be of limited value and 
effectiveness.  
• Non- pharmacologic interventions can improve both pain and function  (see page 7 ). 
• Acetaminophen is the preferred drug for i nitial treatment  because of its stronger safety profile.  
• Opioids are rarely indicated for the treatment of back pain. Opioid prescriptions for acute back 
pain, if made, should be limited to 3 days  and followed by a check -back with the patient.  
 
The treatme nt and follow -up recommendations in this guideline apply to patients with non -specific back 
pain. Back pain caused by degenerative disk disease, herniated (“slipped”) disk, spinal stenosis, or other 
specific conditions is  outside the scope of this guidelin e.  
Virtual care and back pain  
For patients with acute or subacute low back pain, there is promising evidence that virtual care in 
combination with usual care may be more effective than usual care alone for decreasing pain and 
disability and improving phys ical function. Virtual encounters —by phone, chat, and video— may be 
particularly suitable for pain assessment and counseling interventions. Evidence suggests that  video 
physical therapy visits for low back pain assessment produce results comparable to in- person visits in  
defining range of motion, pain symptoms, and mobility limitations.  
KPWA has several virtual care tools/systems to ensure that patients seeking care for back pain receive 
consistent assessment, guidance, and follow -up, regardless of where they enter the delivery system. 
These include Back Pain E -visits, Physical Therapy video visits, and Spine Clinical RN triage phone visits.  
 
  
 
Assessment  
To differentiate non- specific back pain from more serious conditions, the assessment should begin with a 
history and physical exam to evaluate the patient for “red flag” symptoms (listed in Table 1, following   3 
 page). If red flag symptoms are present, patients should be immediately referred to an appropriate 
specialist for further diagnosis and management. If the patient has no red flag symptoms, proceed with 
the STarT Back Tool to further assess the patient’s psychosocial and physical symptoms and establish 
the patient’s level of complexity.  
Pain and function assessment  
To assess patients’ pain and funct ion, use the Pain intensity, interference with Enjoyment of life, and 
interference with General activity ( PEG ) Tool. This tool is available in KP HealthConnect  as the 
SmartPhrase .pegscore, and as a documentation flowsheet, review flowsheet, and secure message.  It is 
also available in hard copy.

History and physical exam  
Discuss elements of the patient’s history that might suggest a specific cause, including:  
1. This pain episode  
2. Physical activity before and during this pain episode , and factors that exacerbate or alleviate the 
pain 
3. Previous pain episodes  
Assess the patient for the presence and severity of neurologic deficits.  
Diagnosis of non -specific back pain  
Based on history and physical exam, and after ruling out red- flag conditions  (such as cancer, infection, or 
cauda equina syndrome) , the vast majority of back pain cases can be diagnosed as non -specific, i.e., 
with no specific identifiable spinal cause.   
A note about imaging  
In general, imaging (X -ray, MRI) should not be considered in the first 6 weeks of a back pain 
episode unless red flag symptoms are present.

 Red flag warning signs requiring immediate or urgent evaluation  
Table 1. Red flag warning signs requiring immediate or urgent evaluation

 • Saddle anesthesia  
• Motor deficit at multiple levels  
• Urinary retention  
• Fecal incontinence

neurological deficits  
 • Progressive motor weakness   
• Severe or incapacitating back or leg pain (e.g., requiring 
hospitalization, precluding walking, or significantly limiting 
activities of daily living ) 
Cancer   • History of cancer with new onset low back pain  
• Unexplained weight loss

fracture due to acute injury  • History of osteoporosis  
• Use of corticosteroids  
• Older age  
Inflammatory back pain   • Morning stiffness lasting longer than 30 minutes (especially 
upon rising) in patient under age  40 
Complexity stratification  
Stratification assesses the likelihood that a patient’s non- specific back pain will become a high- intensity 
health problem by accounting for psychosocial factors —such as anxiety —as well as physical factors.   
The recommended tool for stratifying patients with back pain is the Keele STarT  Back Screening Tool, a 
9-item questionnaire. The STarT  Back  may be filled out by patients directly as an attachment to an 
outgoing secure message prior to the appointment, or entered into a KP HealthConnect documentation 
flowsheet  by the medical assistant during patient rooming.  
Using the STarT  Back , patients are stratified into one of three categories:  low complexity, medium 
complexity, or high complexity.   
Complexity  levels are not synonymous with pain severity or chronicity —for example, a patient with anxiety 
might be categorized as high -complex ity despite havin g relatively mild pain, while a patient who has 
severe pain but is confident that it will go away might be at medium complexity —and they should not be 
the sole factor in determining appropriate interventions.  Instead, complexity levels are most useful for:   
• Establishing a common language for communication between clinicians and patient s 
• Identifying conditions that might otherwise be missed (e.g., depression, anxiety, substance abuse)  
• Incorporating the patient’s psychosocial needs into the care plan

STarT Back scoring  
Scoring of the STarT Back Tool takes into account two scores: the total score as well as the sub 
score (sum of the points from questions 5 –9 only).   
Complexity  
 level Total s core  
(Q 1–9) Sub score  
 (Q 5–9) 
LOW  3 or less  — 
MEDIUM  4 or more  3 or less  
HIGH  4 or more  
Low complexity  = minimal physical and psychosocial symptoms  
Medium complexity  = moderate to severe physical symptoms with some psychosocial symptoms  
High complexity  = moderate to severe physical symptoms and  prominent psychosocial symptoms, such 
as anxiety and fear    6 
 Treatment  
The primary goal of treatment is to maximize function and quality of life , rather than to completely 
eliminate pain. Some ongoing or recurrent pain is normal and not indicative of a serious problem.  
Avoid exposing the patient to unhelpful or poss ibly risky interventions.  
As a general rule, an  intervention in which the patient is an active participant ( e.g., physical therapy, 
walking, stretching, yoga) rather than a passive recipient (e. g., chiropractic, massage, acupuncture) is 
deemed to have greater potential to promote self -efficacy and self -management skills in the long term.  If 
using physically passive interventions, such as spinal manipulation, acupuncture, or relaxation 
techniques, introduce an active option within a week.  
Advise the patient to build strength and endurance gradually , moving naturally , avoid ing guarded or 
bracing behavior , and focusing on low -impact forms of exercise.  
 
Advise the patient that there are many different interventions available,  so patients should try numerous 
options until they find the one that works best for them.

Advise patients to check with Member Services to determine their individual coverage and benefits.    7 
 RECOMMENDED  non-pharmacologic interventions  
Please note that not all of these interventions  are available or covered at KPWA; patients should contact 
Member  Services for information on their own coverage.  
• Reassurance:  Address the patient’s specific fears or worries (e.g. , long- term disability, 
undiagnosed serious disease).  Affirm/acknowledge the patient’s pain and suffer ing/loss of 
function.  Provide reassurance that for the majority of patients, back pain symptoms will resolve or 
significantly diminish in a few days or weeks.  
• Education : Educate patients that the primary goal of treatment is to maximize function and 
quality of life, rather than to completely eliminate pai n. Some ongoing or recurrent pain is normal 
and not indicative of a serious problem.  Offer the shared decision- making DVD  “Chronic Low 
Back Pain: Managing Your Pain and Your Life, ” use the appropriate SmartPhrase for the patient ’s 
level of complexity ( .AVSBackPainLow, .AVSBackPainMed, or  .AVSBackPainHigh ), and/or  
recommend the patient explore the online content on low back pain on Healthwise . 
• Usual activity as able: Encourage the patient to stay active and carry on with normal activities —
including work —as much as possible while paying attention to correct posture to minimize spine 
loading.  Advise the patient to temporarily limit or avoid specific activities known to increase 
mechanical stress on the spine (e.g., prolonged unsupported sitting, heavy lifting, and bending or 
twisting the back, especially while lifting).  
• Encourage low-impact activities such as walking , swimming or elliptical.  Walking places low 
stress on the spine and is available to almost everyone. Walking helps maintain endurance and 
function, and helps with pain. Recommend a gradual increase in exercise o f no more than 10% 
per week. Advise patients t o start slow with short walks 2– 3 times per day  and then increase their 
distance or speed every 3 –5 days if there is no increase in symptoms.  
• Self-care:  Self-care includes staying physicall y active, getting enough sleep, connecting with 
friends and family,  eating well, managing physical and emotional stressors, and staying involved 
in everyday activities.  Advise the patient to identify enjoyable and meaningful activities that will 
increase strength, flexibility and endurance.  
• Superficial heat : Heat may help  to reduce low back pain. Advise the patient to a pply heat for 15 
to 20 minutes at a time.  Moist heat (hot packs, baths) might work better than dry heat.  If an 
electric heating pad is used , advise the patient to be careful not to fall asleep while the pad is on 
to avoid heat burn.  
• Better Choices, Better Health ® workshop   
The Better Choices, Better Health web- based workshop lasts 6 weeks, but there's no set time to 
participate. Participants log on for activities 2 to 3 times each week at their convenience and, 
once the workshop is over, they can join an ongoing moderated self -management community, 
Healthier Living Alumni, to reinforce the skills gained during the workshop.  
This workshop improves outcomes for patients with ongoing health conditions, including back 
pain, as participants experience fewer symptoms, get more exercise, have better medication 
adherence, are more active partners in their health care, and spend less time in the hospital. This 
program is offered to patients free of charge.  Use .avsBCBH to refer patients to the program. 
Patients can register at  https://enroll -kpwa1.selfmanage.org/ . See the  KPWA public 
website  for more information.  
• Physical therapy (PT): Evidence suggests improved outcomes for patients who have early PT , 
and that video PT visits produce results comparable to in- person visits. Strengthening and 
endurance exercises are the most effective for back pain, as are counseling strategies that 
decrease the perceived threat or fear associated with low back pain.  Most  patients may self -refer 
to PT for evaluation and treatment; advise patients to check with Member Services to determine 
their individual coverage and benefits.   
• Relaxation therapy:  Relaxation therapy includes meditation, progressive muscle relaxation, 
biofeedback,  and guided visualization.  Educate patients that people who are in pain tend to tense 
their muscles and hold their breath, potentially leading to further tension and pain, and encourage 
them to practic e frequent relaxation.    8 
 • Yoga: Benefits both pain and function.  Begin ners should practice under the supervision of a 
qualified instructor . 
• Tai chi : Tai chi is a series of movements done slowly to improve posture, balance, coordination, 
endurance and flexibility.  
• Acupuncture: Evidence suggests that acupuncture may improve chronic back pain in the short 
term.  Long- term improvement is unknown.  Most patients may self -refer for acupuncture; advise 
patients to check with Member Services to determine their individual coverage and be nefits.  
• Spinal manipulation: Evidence suggests moderate impact on both pain and function.  Most 
patients may self -refer for spinal manipulation; advise patients to check with Member Services to 
determine their individual coverage and benefits.  
• Massage:  There is s ome evidence of moderate improvement in both pain and function  with 
massage.   
• Physical Medicine &amp; Rehabilitation  (PMR ): Consider referral to PMR, which develops detailed 
treatment plans to enable individual patients to carry out their rehabilitation,  including exercise 
and self -care. PMR can also provide a second opinion for patients with suboptimal response to a 
conservative treatment regimen.  
• Psychotherapy: Consider a referral to Mental Health and Wellness . There is evidence for two 
specific psychot herapies: cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for pain and mindfulness -based 
stress reduction (MBSR). The evidence does not show a difference between these two 
treatments. While the evidence suggests a potential long- term (&gt; 1 year) benefit for improving 
pain, it is mixed on improving function. CBT for pain is currently available, on a limited basis, at 
KPWA . MBSR is not currently available at KPWA,  but patients may opt to attend a communit y-
based MBSR program . 
Non-pharmacologic interventions  that are NOT recommended  
The following interventions are not recommended due to evidence suggesting lack of benefit:  
• Bed rest  
• Traction  
 
Note about  weight loss as an intervention : We recommend against d elaying interventions for back pain 
until patients lose weight , as there is no evidence that the delay improves long- term outcomes.  There is 
insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of weight loss in improving long- term outcomes for 
back pain management.   
 The following interventions are not recommended due to insufficient evidence to determine benefit:  
• Back school  
• Inferential therapy  
• Low-level laser therapy  
• Transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation  
• Lumbar corset  
• Therapeutic ultrasound  
• Nerve root blocks  
• Intra-discal electrothermal therapy  
• Prolotherapy  
 • Radiofrequency facet joint denervation  
• Sacroiliac  joint injections  
• Trigger point/soft tissue injections  
• Discography   
• Kyphoplasty  
• Percutaneous intradiscal radiofrequency 
thermocoagulation  
• Vertebral axial decompression for back pain  
   9 
 Epidural steroid injections  
Epidural steroid injections are not recommended  for patients with non- specific back pain, due to a 
lack of evidence of the safety and effectiveness for this use.  The Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) does not approve of the use of corticosteroid injections into the epidural space and in April 
2014 iss ued a warning that this practice may result in rare but serious adverse events, including loss 
of vision, stroke, paralysis, and death. See the FDA Safety Announcement at 
http://www.fda.gov/ Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm394280.htm  (accessed March 2021) . 
 
Pharmacologic  Options  
Consider the risks of any medication and prescribe the lowest effective dose for the shortest period of time.  
Preferred medications : acetaminophen, NSAIDs  
Most pharmacologic options for non- specific back pain have clear risks that outweigh any potential 
benefit. Monotherapy with acetaminophen or NSAIDs is recommended. The dosages given below may need to be modified based on the patient’s risk factors.  
Acetaminophen  
Because of its stronger safety profile, acetaminophen is the preferred drug for initial treatment of non-specific back pain.  
Recommended initial dose: 500 –650 mg t.i.d.  
Maximum daily dose: 3,000 mg  
Note: In patients with liver disease or al cohol use problems, the daily dose of acetaminophen should not 
exceed 1,000 –1,500  mg. 
Non-steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)  
For medium-  or high- complexity patients, a trial of NSAIDs may be considered if acetaminophen has 
been ineffective. NSAIDs such as ibuprofen or naproxen should be used with caution in patients with 
cardiovascular morbidities, risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, or hepatic or renal dysfunction. Among the 
NSAIDs, meloxicam is partially selective and may have decreased risk of adv erse GI effects compared to 
non-selective NSAIDs.  
NSAID  Maximum daily dose  
Ibuprofen  2,400 mg  
Naproxen  1,250 mg  
Meloxicam  15 mg  
Adjunct therapy for chronic pain: duloxetine  
Duloxetine may be considered for medium-  or high- complexity patients with chronic  pain, and is 
preferred to opioid medications.  
Recommended initial dose: 30 mg daily for 1 week, then increase to 60 mg daily  
Maximum daily dose: 60 mg  
Note:  Duloxetine shoul d not be abruptly discontinued, as withdrawal effects can occur.    10 
 Special considerations : opioids  
Opioids , including tramadol, are rarely indicated for the treatment of back pain.  While opioids 
appear to be similarly efficacious to acetaminophen and NSAIDs,  they have more risks and side effects , 
including the risk of dependence and substance abuse disorder. One study (AMDG 2015) showed that of 
patients who took opioids for 90 days or longer, 60 percent were still taking opioids 5 years later.  
The Centers for  Disease Control and Prevention (2016) recommends against  prescribing opioids for 
chronic back pain. See the Chronic Opioid Therapy Safety Guideline.  Low-quality  evidence shows that 
opioids may reduce pain in patients with chronic low back pain in the short term. However, the effect is 
small  and not clinically important , and long- term efficacy is unknown.   
There is insufficient evidence to determine the effects of  opioids on acute back pain. Opioid 
prescriptions for acute back pain, if made, should be limited to 3 days  and followed by a check -
back with the patient. As in all situations where opioid therapy is considered, the focus should be on 
improved functionalit y rather than complete pain relief.  
Medications  that are NOT recommended  
• Systemic corticosteroids  
• Gabapentin  
• Celecoxib (non- formulary)  
• Topiramate  
• Pregabalin  
• Skeletal muscle relaxants  
Follow -up/Monitoring  
• For high- complexity patients , early and frequent in- person follow -up may be appropriate.  At a 
minimum, have patients check back at 2 weeks .  
• For low - and medium- complexity patients, follow  up only as needed. Options for follow -up include a 
phone call, secure e- mail message, or office visit. 
• Patients referred for  spinal manipulation, acupuncture, or massage: Have patient check back after 
four visits with the referred specialty to demonstrate improved functionality.  
• Patients should be educated to stay active to minimize the potential for relapse.  
    11 
 Evidence Summary 
The Non-specific Back Pain Guideline was developed using an evidence- based process, including 
systematic literature search, critical appraisal, and evidence synthesis.  
As part of our improvement process, the Kaiser Permanente Washington guideline team is working 
towards developing new clinical guidelines and updating the current guidelines regularly. To achieve this 
goal, we are adapting evidence- based recommendations from high- quality national and international 
external guidelines, if available and appropriate. The external guidelines should meet several quality 
standards to be considered for adaptation. They must: be developed by a multidisciplinary team with no 
or minimal conflicts of interest; be evidence- based; address a population that is reasonably similar to our 
population; and be transparent about the frequency of updates and the date the current version was 
completed.  
In addition to identifying the recently published guidelines that meet the above standards, a literature 
search was conducted to identify studies relevant to the key questions that are not addressed by the 
external guidelines.  
External guidelines eligible for adapting

Chronic Pain: A Systematic Review Update  
• 2020 Agency for Health Research and Quality: Nonopioid Pharmacologic Treatments for Chronic Pain

and Health from the Orthopaedic Section of the American Physical Therapy Association  
Key Questions  
1. What is the clinical effectiveness of telehealth -based interventions in the management of non -
specific low back pain?  
A systematic review and meta- analysis (Dario 2017) of 11 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that 
included adult patients with subacute, acute or chronic low back pain was reviewed. Telehealth- based 
interventions were compared to usual care/minimal interventions. Length of telehealth interventions 
varied from 4 weeks to 1 year. Telehealth interventions alone are not more effective than minimal 
interventions in terms of pain and disability reduction in patients with chronic low back pain. However, 
in patient s with acute or subacute LBP, telehealth in addition to usual care may be more effective 
than usual care alone for pain, disability, and physical function.  
An RCT (Heapy 2017) with moderate risk of bias reported that cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) supported by health technology ( interactive voice response– based CBT ) is comparable to in- person 
CBT in patients with chronic LBP on the mid- term (9 months). Another RCT (Amorim 2019) with 
moderate risk of bias found that the addition of telephone- based health coaching sessions (supported 
by internet -based application and activity tracker) is not better (no difference) than standard of care in 
chronic LBP on the mid- term (6 months).  
Four non- RCTs (Cottrell 2018, Palacín- Marín 2013, Peterson 2019, Truter 2013) with small sample 
sizes showed high agreement between in- person and telerehabilitation evaluations for a variety of 
outcomes.  
2. What is the clinical effectiveness of antidepressants (specifically duloxetine and tricyclic s) for 
the treat ment of acute or chronic low back pain?  
AHRQ 2020 has been adapted: In patients with low back pain, short -term duloxetine use resulted in a 
small improvement in pain severity and response, but the improvements in function and quality of life 
did not meet t he threshold for a small improvement, based on pooled analysis of three trials ( strength   12 
 of evidence:  moderate). In the intermediate term, a single study of amitriptyline found no improvement 
in pain or function in patients with low back pain ( strength of evidence: l ow). 
3. What is the clinical effectiveness of anticonvulsants (specifically pregabalin) for the treatment 
of acute or chronic low back pain?  
A systematic review and meta- analysis (Enke 2018) including nine RCTs was reviewed. Most studies 
compared anticonvulsants with placebo and had low risk of bias. Anticonvulsants included 
gabapentin, pregabalin and topiramate. The review showed that anticonvulsants (pregabalin, 
gabapentin) were ineffective for pain and disability in patients with chronic low back  pain or lumbar 
radicular pain in the short and intermediate terms. The risk of adverse events was higher for 
anticonvulsants. Similarly, AHRQ 2020 indicated that in the short term, pregabalin/gabapentin 
resulted in large increases in blurred vision, dizzi ness, weight gain, and cognitive effects (confusion).  
4. What is the clinical effectiveness of muscle relaxants (cyclobenzaprine, methocarbamol, 
tizanidine, baclofen) for non -specific acute and chronic low back pain ? 
No new high- quality studies comparing musc le relaxants to placebo were identified. However, two 
low-quality RCTs (Friedman 2018,  Friedman 2019) showed that the addition of muscle relaxants 
(tizanidine, methocarbamol) to naproxen or ibuprofen does not confer additional efficacy for acute low 
back pain. Friedman 2018 randomized patients to naproxen (500 mg) + placebo or naproxen + 
methocarbamol (750 mg) or naproxen + orphenadrine (100 mg). The authors reported improvement in Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ)  scores  in all groups with no s erious adverse 
events. Friedman 2019 concluded that the addition of tizanidine to ibuprofen did not confer additional efficacy at 1 week after an ED visit for acute low back pain.  
5. What is the clinical effectiveness of epidural steroid injections for the tr eatment of chronic low 
back pain ?  
The North American Spine Society (NASS) 2020 guidelines have been adapted:  
• There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against the use of caudal 
epidural steroid injections in patients with low back pa in. (Grade of Recommendation: I)  
• There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against the use of 
interlaminar epidural steroid injections in patients with low back pain. (Grade of 
Recommendation: I)  
6. What is the clinical effectiveness of acupuncture in the treatment of acute and chronic low 
back pain?  
7. What is the clinical effectiveness of mindfulness -based stress reduction (MBSR) in treating 
non-specific chronic low back pain in adults?  
AHRQ 2020 guidelines have been ado pted for both questi ons. Acupuncture and MBSR are 
recommended.  
8. What are the specific aspects of early physical therapy in patients with acute non -specific low 
back pain that are effective?  
American Physical Therapy Association 2012 guidelines have been adapted:  
• Manual therapy, trunk coordination, strengthening, and endurance exercises, centralization 
and directional preference exercises and procedures should be considered (strong evidence).  
• Progressive endurance exercise and fitness activities should be considered (strong evidence).  
• Patient education and counseling strategies that either directly or indirectly increase the 
perceived threat or fear associated with low back pain should not be used (moderate evidence).  
• Flexion exercises, combined with other interventions s uch as manual therapy, strengthening 
exercises, nerve mobilization procedures, and progressive walking can be considered (weak 
evidence).  
• Lower -quarter nerve mobilization procedures should be considered (weak evidence).  
• Traction (conflicting evidence).

 9. Is there evidence that losing weight improves long -term outcomes for back pain 
management?  
One low -quality RCT (Williams 2018) that assigned overweight and obese patients to lifestyle 
intervention or usual care was identified. Patients were followed for 6 months. The authors found that 
healthy lifestyle intervention (telephone advice, education, and referral to a 6- month telephone- based 
healthy lifestyle coaching service targeting weight loss, physical activity, and diet) did not reduce pain 
intensity, self -reported weight, or any other secondary outcomes. Intervention did not reduce weight. 
More high- quality studies are warranted. There is insufficient direct evidence to determine the 
effectiveness of weight loss in improving long- term outcomes for back pain m anagement.  
10. What is the impact of cultural literacy on low back pain outcomes?  
American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) recommendations have been adopted. “AAFP supports the broad adoption of cultural sensitivity standards by government, payers, health care 
organizations, practices and individuals. When cultural sensitivity is an expected standard in health care delivery, ‘optimal health for everyone’ means everyone.”
