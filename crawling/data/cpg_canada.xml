 Low Back PainLow Back Pain 
Note: An * indicates 
a recommendation was revised or a new 
recommendation was added Introduction This guideline has been adapted from eight “seed” guidelines referenced as G1 through G8 
published between 2003 and 2010 for prevention, acute and subacute, and chronic low back pain (Appendix G. “Seed” Guideline References). A supplementary literature search current to December 2010 was conducted for systematic reviews of other interventions not available in the “seed” guidelines ( Appendix E Evidence Source). 
Recommendations are based upon reviews of the research literature at the time of publication, and recently published evidence is not necessary incorporated. As always, clinical judgment and experience are always critical factors in considering the application of guideline recommendations for any individual patient. 
When considering recommended interventions, it is important to take into account the 
patient’s expectations and preferences, but do not use his/her expectations and preferences to predict their response to treatments. Discrepancies between patient expectations and preferences and evidence-informed practice could reflect a lack of awareness. This presents 
an opportunity for dialogue, mutual decision-making, and utilizing educational resources. 
The most common type of low back pain is called ‘non-specific low back pain’, and accounts 
for approximately 90% of cases in primary care settings.
1-6 Less than 2% of people with 
low back pain have potentially serious spine conditions that will require surgery or medical intervention.
6,7 
Between 49% and 90% of people in developed countries will experience at least one episode of low back pain during their lifetime.
1-5 Low back pain is most common among the working 
population, particularly men, with peak incidence occurring in people aged between 25 and 64 years.
5,8 Back pain usually resolves within 2 weeks, but symptoms may linger for up to 
2 months.5,9,10 However, 24% to 80% of patients will experience further episodes within a 
year, and over three quarters will have a reoccurrence at some point in their lives.5,8,9 A small 
minority of patients (2% to 7%) will develop chronic low back pain.5,9 
A similar prevalence and clinical course for low back pain is reflected in Canadian data.11,12 
A survey13 of 2,400 individuals revealed the lifetime prevalence of back pain in Alberta and 
Saskatchewan was 83.8%, with 61.8% of respondents reporting back pain in the last year. 
The management of low back pain can be complex and costly. In Alberta and Saskatchewan, 
close to 40% of patients with back pain seek help from a healthcare provider .13 Primary care 
physicians undertake the initial evaluation in 65% of low back pain cases and are often the sole provider for these patients.
1,14 Thus, primary care practitioners play an important role in 
the management of patients with low back pain.

Summary of Recommendations:
Recommendation Evidence Source 
(see legend on P.6) 
Patient Education
Practitioners should provide information or patient education material on 
back pain prevention and care of the healthy back that emphasizes patient responsibility and workplace ergonomics. 
Practitioners should emphasize that acute low back pain is nearly always 
benign and generally resolves within 1 to 6 weeks. 
There is insufficient evidence to determine what quantity, intensity, or media is 
optimal for delivering this information. (See patient pamphlet See companion documents, patient information sheets: “What You Should Know About Acute Low Back Pain” and “What You Should Know About Chronic Low Back Pain” and patient booklets: “Acute Low Back Pain: So Your Back Hurts ... Learn what works, what doesn’t and how to help yourself” and Chronic Low Back Pain: So Your Back Hurts ... Learn what works, what doesn’t and how to help yourself”). 
Patient information and educational material based on a biomedical or 
biomechanical model (anatomical and “traditional” posture information) can convey negative messages about back pain and are not recommended. SR (G2, G5) 
Physical Activity
Physical activity is recommended. There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against any specific kind of exercise, or the frequency/intensity of training SR (G5) 
Shoe Insoles / Orthoses
The use of shoe insoles or orthoses is not recommended for the prevention of low back pain. RCT (G5)
 Lumbar Supports* 
The use of lumbar supports is not recommended for the prevention of low back pain. RCT (G3) + 
SR (IHE database) 
? Spinal Manipulative Therapy or Spinal Mobilization 
No evidence was found to recommend regular spinal manipulative therapy or 
spinal mobilization for the prevention of low back pain. RCT (G5)  8

Although overweight/obesity and smoking are associated with the increased 
prevalence of low back pain, there is insufficient evidence to recommend modifying these risk factors for the prevention of low back pain. 
There is insufficient evidence to recommend reducing alcohol consumption for 
the prevention of low back pain. SR (G3) +

Recommendation Evidence Source 
(see legend on P.6) 
Diagnostic Triage
The first qualified practitioner with the ability to do a full assessment (i.e. 
history taking, physical and neurological examination, and psychosocial risk factor assessment) should assess the patient and undertake diagnostic triage. (See Appendix A  for summary of red and yellow flags and companion 
documents, “ Clinical Assessment for Psychosocial Yellow Flags” and “What 
can be done to help somebody who is at risk? ”). 
If serious spinal pathology is excluded, manage as low back pain as per the reassessment and treatment recommendations below. 
Ankylosing Spondylitis* 
Consider a diagnosis of ankylosing spondylitis, particularly in younger adults who, in the absence of injury, present with a history of needing to get out of bed at night and reduced side bending. SR (G2, G4) 
EO (GDG)  9

Recommendation Evidence Source 
(see legend on P.6) 
Emergent Cases
Patients with red flags (See Appendix A  for red flag definitions) indicating a high 
likelihood of serious underlying pathology should be referred for immediate 
evaluation and treatment to an appropriate resource depending on what is available in your region (e.g. emergency room, relevant specialist.) EO (G2) 
Cases Requiring Further Evaluation
Schedule an urgent appointment with a physician if any of the red flags are present. (See Appendix A for red flag definitions.) EO (G2) 
Referral to a Spinal Care Specialist
Patients with disabling back or leg pain, or significant limitation of function including job related activities should be referred within 2 to 6 weeks to a trained spinal care specialist such as a physical therapist, chiropractor, osteopathic physician, or physician who specializes in musculoskeletal medicine. EO (G2) 
Referral for MRI and Possible Surgical Opinion for Radiculopathy*
If the patient has radiculopathy (leg-dominant pain) that persists after 6 weeks of conservative treatment, consider referral for MRI. If clinical and imaging findings correlate, consider referral to a spinal surgeon. CS (G8) + 
EO (GDG) 
Laboratory Testing
If cancer or infection is suspected, order the appropriate blood tests. In the absence 
of red flags, no laboratory tests are recommended. EO (G2) 
Psychosocial Risk Factors
Primary care evaluation should include assessment for psychosocial risk factors (‘yellow flags’) and a detailed review if there is no improvement. (See Appendix 
A for summary of yellow flags and companion documents, “Clinical Assessment 
for Psychosocial Yellow Flags” and “What can be done to help somebody who is at risk?”). Psychosocial risk factors (yellow flags) include fear, financial problems, anger, depression, job dissatisfaction, family problems, or stress. SR (G2, G4)  10

Recommendation Evidence Source 
(see legend on P.6) 
Reassessment of Patients Whose Symptoms Fail to Resolve
Reassess patients whose symptoms are not resolving. Follow-up in 1 week if 
pain is severe and has not subsided. Follow-up in 3 weeks if moderate pain is not improving. Follow-up in 6 weeks if not substantially recovered. If serious pathology (red flag) is identified, consider further appropriate management. Identify psychosocial risk factors (yellow flags) and address appropriately. (See Appendix A  for definitions of red and yellow flags and companion 
documents “Clinical Assessment for Psychosocial Yellow Flags” and “What can be done to help somebody who is at risk?” for chronicity and increased disability). G (G2, G4) 
Information and Reassurance
Educate the patient and describe the typically benign, long-term course of low back pain. 
Provide education materials that are consistent with your verbal advice to 
reduce fear and anxiety, and emphasize active self-management. (See the companion documents – “What You Should Know About Acute Low Back” and “Acute Low Back Pain - So Your Back Hurts ... Learn what works, what doesn’t and how to help yourself”) Other methods for providing self-care education, such as e-mail discussion groups and videos, are not well studied, but may also be beneficial. (See http://www.ihe.ca/research/lbpvideo/) SR (G1) + 
EO (GDG) 
Advice to Stay Active
Patients should be advised to stay active and continue their usual activity, 
including work, within the limits permitted by the pain. Physical exercise is recommended. 
Patients should limit/pace any activity or exercise that causes spread of 
symptoms (peripheralization). Self-treating with an exercise program not specifically designed for the patient may aggravate symptoms. SR (G1, G2, G4) 
Return to Work
Encourage early return to work. 
Refer workers with low back pain beyond 6 weeks to a comprehensive return-to-
work rehabilitation program. Effective programs are typically multidisciplinary and involve case management, education about keeping active, psychological, or behavioural treatment, and participation in an exercise program. 
Working despite some residual discomfort poses no threat and will not harm 
patients. SR (G1, G2)  11

Recommendation Evidence Source 
(see legend on P.6) 
Heat or Cold Packs
Superficial heat (application of heating pads or heated blankets) is 
recommended for the short term relief of acute low back pain. Clinical experience supports a role for superficial cold packs and alternating heat and cold as per patient preference. Heat or cold should not be applied directly to the skin, and not for longer than 15 to 20 minutes. Use with care if lack of protective sensation. SR (G1) + EO (GDG) 
Analgesia
Prescribe medication, if necessary, for pain relief preferably to be taken at regular 
intervals. First choice acetaminophen; second choice NSAIDs. 
Only consider adding a short course of muscle relaxant (benzodiazepines, 
cyclobenzaprine, or antispasticity drugs) on its own, or added to NSAIDs, if acetaminophen or NSAIDs have failed to reduce pain. 
Serious adverse effects of NSAIDs include gastrointestinal complications (e.g. 
bleeding, perforation and increased blood pressure). Drowsiness, dizziness, and dependency are common adverse effects of muscle relaxants. (See Medication Table in Appendix B.) SR (G1, G2b, G4, 
G7)+ EO (GDG) 
Spinal Manipulation
Patients who are not improving may benefit from referral for spinal manipulation 
provided by a trained spinal care specialist such as a physical therapist, chiropractor, osteopathic physician, or physician who specializes in musculoskeletal medicine. 
Risk of serious complication after spinal manipulation is low (estimated risk: Cauda 
Equina Syndrome less than 1 in one million). Current guidelines contraindicate manipulation in patients with severe or progressive neurological deficit. SR (G1, G4)
 Multidisciplinary Treatment Programs For Subacute Low Back Pain*
For subacute low back pain (duration 4 to 8 weeks), intensive interdisciplinary 
rehabilitation (defined as an intervention that includes a physician consultation coordinated with a psychological, physical therapy, social, or vocational intervention) is moderately effective. 
Functional restoration with a cognitive-behavioral component reduces work 
absenteeism due to subacute low back pain in occupational settings. SR (G1)  12

Recommendation Evidence Source 
(see legend on P.6) 
Bed Rest
Do not prescribe bed rest as a treatment. 
If the patient must rest, bed rest should be limited to no more than 2 days. 
Prolonged bed rest for more than 4 days is not recommended for acute low back problems. Bed rest for longer than two days increases the amount of sick leave compared to early resumption of normal activity in acute low back pain. 
There is evidence that prolonged bed rest is harmful. SR (G2, G4, G7) 
Diagnostic Imaging
For acute low back pain (no red flags), diagnostic imaging tests, including 
X-ray, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are not indicated. 
In the absence of red flags, routine use of X-rays is not justified due to the risk 
of high doses of radiation and lack of specificity. SR (G1, G4, G8) 
Traction
Do not use traction. Traction has been associated with significant adverse events. 
Passive treatment modalities such as traction should be avoided as mono-
therapy and not routinely used because they may increase the risk of illness behaviour and chronicity. 
The following adverse effects from traction were reported: reduced muscle tone, 
bone demineralization, and thrombophlebitis. SR (G1, G4, G7) 
Therapeutic Ultrasound *
Do not use therapeutic ultrasound for acute or subacute low back pain. RCT (G1) + SR 
(IHE database) 
Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS)
TENS is not recommended for the treatment of acute low back pain. SR (G1, G4)

Systemic Steroids*
Systemic corticosteroids (intramuscular injection) are not effective for the 
treatment of patients with acute low back pain and a negative result on a straight-leg-raise test. RCT (G1)
 Epidural Steroids In The Absence Of Radiculopathy
Do not use epidural steroid injections for acute low back pain without radiculopathy. SR (G4)
? Epidural Steroids In The Presence Of Radiculopathy* 
It may be helpful to use epidural steroid injections for patients with radicular pain for longer than 6 weeks who have not responded to first line treatments. 
Fluoroscopy improves/verifies accuracy. Even in the most experienced 
hands, epidural injections can be misplaced. 
Adverse effects are infrequent and include headache, fever, subdural 
penetration and more rarely epidural abscess and ventilatory depression. SR (G4) + 
EO (GDG) 
Narcotic Analgesics (Opioids)*? 
There is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of opioids in the treatment 
of acute low back pain. However clinical experience suggests the use of opioids may be necessary to relieve severe musculoskeletal pain. If used, opioids are preferable for only short term intervention. Ongoing need for opioids is an indication for reassessment. 
In general, opioids and compound analgesics have a substantially increased 
risk of side effects compared with acetaminophen alone. SR (G1, G2b, G7) 
+ EO (GDG) 
? Therapeutic Exercise 
There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against any specific kind 
of exercise, or the frequency/intensity of training. Clinical experience suggests that supervised or monitored therapeutic exercise may be useful following an individualized assessment by a spine care specialist. For patients whose pain is exacerbated by physical activity and exercise, refer to a physical therapist, chiropractor, osteopathic physician, or physician who specializes in musculoskeletal medicine for therapeutic exercise recommendations. 
Patients should discontinue any activity or exercise that causes spread of 
symptoms (peripheralization). Self-treating with an exercise program not specifically designed for the patient may aggravate symptoms. SR (G2,G4) + SR

Diagnostic Tests
In chronic low back pain, X-rays of the lumbar spine are very poor indicators 
of serious pathology. Hence, in the absence of clinical red flags spinal X-rays are not encouraged. More specific and appropriate diagnostic imaging should be performed on the basis of the pathology being sought (e.g. DEXA scan for bone density, bone scan for tumours and inflammatory diseases). However, lumbar spine X-rays may be required for correlation prior to more sophisticated diagnostic imaging, for example prior to an MRI scan. In this case, the views should be limited to standing AP and lateral in order to achieve better assessment of stability and stenosis. Oblique views are not generally recommended. CT scans are best limited to suspected fractures or contraindication to MRI. 
In the absence of red flags, radiculopathy, or neurogenic claudication, MRI 
scanning is generally of limited value. 
Oblique view X-rays are not recommended; they add only minimal information in a 
small percentage of cases, and more than double the patient’ s exposure to radiation. EO (GDG)  15

(see legend on P.6) 
Laboratory Testing
If cancer or infection is suspected, order the appropriate blood tests. In the absence 
of red flags, no laboratory tests are recommended. EO (GDG) 
Physical Exercise
Patients should be encouraged to initiate gentle exercise and to gradually increase the exercise level within their pain tolerance. 
Sophisticated equipment is not necessary. Low cost alternatives include 
unsupervised walking and group exercise programs, such as those offered by chronic disease management programs. The peer support of group exercise is likely to result in better outcomes, giving patients improved confidence and empowering them to manage with less medical intervention. 
When exercise exacerbates the patient’s pain, the exercise program should be 
assessed by a qualified physical therapist or exercise specialist. 
If exercise persistently exacerbates their pain, patients should be further assessed 
by a physician to determine if further investigation, medication, treatment, or consultation is required. 
Some studies reported mild negative reactions to exercise programs, such as 
increased low back pain and muscle soreness in some patients. SR (G6) + 
EO (GDG) 
Therapeutic Exercise
A client-specific, graded, active therapeutic exercise program is recommended. EO (GDG) 
Therapeutic Aquatic Exercise*
Therapeutic aquatic exercise is recommended for chronic low back pain. EO (GDG) 
Yoga Therapy*
There is some evidence that Viniyoga and Iyengar types of yoga can be 
helpful in the treatment of chronic low back pain. 
No evidence was found to support recommending other types of yoga. It is important to find an instructor who has experience in working with 
individuals who have LBP to avoid further injury. EO (GDG)  16

Active Rehabilitation
An active rehabilitation program includes: 
• Education about back pain principles 
• Self-management programming (see Self-Management Programs 
recommendation) 
• Gradual resumption of normal activities (including work and physical exercise) as tolerated 
• Therapeutic exercise (see Therapeutic Exercise recommendation ) EO (GDG) 
Self-Management Programs
Where available, refer to a structured community-based self-management 
group program for patients who are interested in learning pain coping skills. These programs are offered through chronic disease management and chronic pain programs. Self-management programs focus on teaching core skills such as self monitoring of symptoms to determine likely causal factors in pain exacerbations or ameliorations, activity pacing, relaxation techniques, communication skills, and modification of negative ‘self talk’  or 
catastrophizing. These programs use goal setting and ‘homework assignments’ to encourage participants’ self confidence in their ability to successfully manage their pain and increase their day-to-day functioning. Most community-based programs also include exercise and activity programming which are also recommended. 
Where structured group programs are not available, refer to a trained 
professional for individual self-management counselling. G (G6) 
Massage Therapy
Massage therapy is recommended as an adjunct to an overall active treatment program. SR (G6) 
Acupuncture
Acupuncture is recommended as a stand-alone therapy or as an adjunct to an 
overall active treatment program. 
No serious adverse events were reported in the trials. The incidence of minor 
adverse events was 5% in the acupuncture group. SR (G6)  17

(see legend on P.6) 
Acetaminophen and Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs* 
(NSAIDs) 
Acetaminophen and NSAIDs are recommended. No one NSAID is more 
effective than another. 
A proton pump inhibitor (PPI) should be considered for patients over 45 years 
of age when offering treatment with an oral NSAID/COX-2 inhibitor. 
NSAIDs are associated with mild to moderately severe side effects such 
as: abdominal pain, bleeding, diarrhea, edema, dry mouth, rash, dizziness, headache, tiredness. There is no clear difference between different types of NSAIDs. (See Medication Table in Appendix B.) SR (G6) + 
EO (GDG)
 Muscle Relaxants     
Some muscle relaxants (e.g. cyclobenzaprine) may be appropriate in selected patients for symptomatic relief of pain and muscle spasm. 
Caution must be exercised with managing side effects, particularly 
drowsiness, and also with patient selection, given the abuse potential for this 
class of drugs. (See Medication Table in Appendix B.) SR (G6) 
Antidepressants
Tricyclic antidepressants have a small to moderate effect for chronic low back 
pain at much lower doses than might be used for depression. 
Possible side-effects include drowsiness and anticholinergic effects. (See 
Medication Table in Appendix B.) SR (G6) + EO 
(GDG) 
Opioids
Long-term use of weak opioids, like codeine, should only follow an unsuccessful trial of non-opioid analgesics. In severe chronic pain, opioids are worth careful consideration. Long acting opioids can establish a steady state blood and tissue level that may minimize the patient’s experience of increased pain from medication withdrawal experienced with short acting opioids. 
Careful attention to incremental changes in pain intensity, function, and side effects 
is required to achieve optimal benefit. Because little is known about the long-term effects of opioid therapy, it should be monitored carefully. 
Opioid side-effects (including headache, nausea, somnolence, constipation, dry 
mouth, and dizziness) should be high in the differential diagnosis of new complaints. 
A history of addiction is a relative contraindication. Consultation with an addictions 
specialist may be helpful in these cases. 
Consult the Canadian Guideline for Safe and Effective Use of Opioids for Chronic Non-
Cancer Pain endorsed by the CPSA.

Herbal Medicine*
The following herbal medicines can be considered as treatment options for 
acute exacerbations of chronic low back pain: 
• An aqueous extract of Harpagophytumprocumbens (also called Devil’ s 
Claw, grapple plant, wood spider) at a standardized daily dosage of 50 
mg harpagoside, 
• A combination of extract of Salix daphnoides and Salix purpurea (also called purple willow, red willow) at a standardized dosage of 240 mg salicin/day and 
• A plaster of Capsicum frutescens (also called bird pepper, hot pepper, red chili, spur pepper, Tabasco pepper) 
Devil’ s Claw was associated with the following adverse events: repeated 
coughs, tachycardia, and gastrointestinal upset. Use of Capsicum frutescens plaster was associated with inflammatory contact eczema, urtcaria, minute haemorragic spots, vesiculation or dermatitis, sensation of warmth locally and pruritis. Patients should be advised to read the product ingredients to ensure they are getting the correct amount and correct product mentioned in the recommendation. It is important to be aware that a product could list on the label different extracts of the same active ingredient (e.g. Devil’ s Claw and wood spider). Devil’ s Claw, Salix and Capsicum frutescens are currently regulated by Health 
Canada. (See http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/dhp-mps/prodnatur/applications/licen-prod/lnhpd-bdpsnh-eng.php) EO (GDG) 
Behavioural Therapy/Progressive Muscle Relaxation
Where group programs are not available, consider referral for individual 
cognitive behavioural treatment provided by psychologist or other qualified provider. SR (G6) 
Multidisciplinary Treatment Program
Referral to a multidisciplinary chronic pain program is appropriate for patients who are significantly affected by chronic pain and who have failed to improve with adequate trials of first line treatment. Get to know the multidisciplinary chronic pain program in your referral area and use it for selected cases of chronic low back pain. SR (G6)  19

 Injection Therapy*
The following injection therapies may be beneficial for carefully selected 
patients (see Appendix C) with a clinical diagnosis of pain originating from 
the lumbar facet joints: 
• Intra-articular facet joint blocks 
• Medial branch blocks (studies show benefit for up to 6 weeks, and 
sometimes longer) 
• Medial branch neurotomy (studies demonstrate pain relief lasting longer than 3 months) 
The clinical diagnosis of facet joint pain lacks specificity and may be best determined by a trained spinal care specialist. The most commonly reported adverse events are: 
• Facet joint interventions: haematoma, steroid side effects, accidental dural puncture and infection. 
• Radiofrequency denervation: increased pain (usually temporary) due to neuritis, and cutaneous dysaesthesias. EO (GDG)
 Epidural Steroid Injections
For patients with leg pain, epidural steroid injections can be effective in providing short-term and occasional long-term pain relief. Fluoroscopy improves/verifies accuracy. Even in the most experienced hands, epidural injections can be misplaced. Transient minor complications include: headache, nausea, pruritis, increased pain of sciatic distribution, and puncture of the dura. SR (G6) + EO (GDG) 
Referral for Surgical Opinion on Spinal Fusion*
Consider referral for an opinion on spinal fusion for patients who: 
• Have completed an optimal package of care including a combined physical and psychological treatment program (usually 6 months of care); and 
• Still have severe low back pain for which the patient would consider surgery, particularly if related to spinal stenosis with leg pain. 
Offer anyone with significant psychological distress appropriate treatment for this before referral for an opinion on spinal fusion. 
Refer the patient to a specialist spinal surgical service if spinal fusion is being 
considered. Give due consideration to the possible risks in that patient. Counsel the patient that surgery may not be an option in his/her case. EO (GDG) 
Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs)*
Do not offer SSRIs for treating chronic low back pain. They may, however, be indicated for co-morbid depression. EO (GDG) 
Motorized Traction*
Do not use motorized traction for chronic low back pain. EO (GDG)  20

(adapted from G2, G4, G6,  
G7, G8, EO (GDG))  Definitions 
Emergency - referral within hours 
Urgent - referral within 24 - 48 hours 
Soon - referral within weeks 
Depending on the clinical situation, consider communicating with the specialist consultant to 
determine the urgency and timelines for referral. 
While patient is waiting to be seen by specialist: general advice is analgesia, rest and activity 
avoidance. Advise patient tests are needed to clarify the diagnosis but that results may be inconclusive. 
•  Cauda Equina Syndrome  (sudden onset of new urinary retention, fecal incontinence, 
saddle(perineal) anesthesia, radicular (leg) pain often bilateral, loss of voluntary rectal sphincter contraction)- EMERGENCY 
 referral to ER 
•  Severe unremitting  (non-mechanical) worsening of pain (at night and pain when 
laying down), consider infection or tumor – URGENT referral to ER for pain control 
– will need prompt investigation 
•  Significant trauma – consider fractures – check for instability and refer URGENTLY  
to spinal surgery, if indicated 
•  Weight loss, fever, history of cancer or HIV  – consider infection or tumor – refer 
URGENTLY for MRI Scan and to spinal surgery, if indicated 
•  Use of IV drugs or steroids – consider infection or compression fracture – URGENT  
investigation required. In case of suspected infection, consider blood work (CBC, ESR and CRP). If blood work is positive, proceed to MRI, if available. In case of suspected compression fracture, proceed to standing AP and lateral X-rays. Risk factors for compression fractures include: severe onset of pain with minor trauma in patients ≥50 years of age (higher risk &gt;65 years of age), history of prolonged corticosteroids intake, or structural deformity. 
•  Widespread neurological signs  – consider tumor or neurological disease – investigate 
further and refer SOON if indicated 
•  Patient over 50, but particularly over 65, with first episode of severe back pain. If other risk factors for malignancy are present (history of cancer/carcinoma in the last 15 years, unexplained weight loss, failure of conservative care (4 weeks)), investigate further, refer SOON as indicated.  23

  Appendix C Injection Therapies 
Injection 
Therapies 
(Adapted from: 
EO(GDG)) Injections therapies, including Prolotherapy, Facet  Joint Blocks, Medial Branch Blocks and 
Neurotomy are areas of active research and the clinical factors that predict their optimum use remain undetermined at present. Nonetheless, clinically, there appears to be reason to support their use in carefully selected patients. At present they are recommended only for patients selected by a clinician with training and experience in evaluating the physical examination findings that the receiving physician has agreed are predictive of successful intervention. The evaluating clinician may be another physician with an interest in these treatment modalities, or a similarly qualified physiotherapist, chiropractor. This requires a degree of local co-operation to establish the appropriate referral networks, which is not feasible in all settings. 
Physical examination findings predictive of facet joint origin for low back pain: While published research suggests a significant degree of inter-examiner variability in 
interpreting physical examination findings, the following are considered by the authors to be suggestive of a facet joint origin for low back pain. Within the limitations noted above, such patients may be considered for referral for facet joint blocks as a confirmatory test: 
• Pain is often of rapid onset. 
• Pain is unilateral or bilateral at or above the belt-line. If radiation to the leg is present it tends to be to the buttocks or lateral thigh and rarely below the knee. 
• Pain tends to be worse with low back extension, and may be relieved with flexion or sitting. 
• Pain may be provoked with palpation over the paravertebral tissues in the area of the facet joints lateral to the midline, and often under several layers of muscle that may also be pain generators. 
• Pain may be provoked by a “Facet Joint Loading Maneuvers” on physical examination, for example: while standing with feet pointing ahead at shoulder distance apart, the patient is asked to look over one shoulder, followed by trunk rotation to the same side, then lumbar extension. The resulting lumbar extension in combination with side-bending and rotation will cause facet joint loading on the same side. The examiner may need to help stabilize the patient to prevent a loss of balance.  26

 Low Back Pain Appendix D Glossary Low Back Pain 
Interferential 
current therapy The superficial application of a medium-frequency alternating current modulated to produce low frequencies up to 150 Hz. It is thought to increase blood flow to tissues and provide pain relief and is considered more comfortable for patients than transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation. 
Intramuscular stimulation Uses very thin needles to 'dry needle' affected areas without the injection of any substance. IMS differs from acupuncture in its application because needle insertion is indicated by physical signs as opposed to the predetermined meridians of acupuncture. IMS is based on known scientific, neurophysiological principles. 
Low-level laser therapy The superficial application of lasers at wavelengths between 632 and 904 nm to the skin in order to apply electromagnetic energy to soft tissue. Optimal treatment parameters (wavelength, dosage, dose-intensity, and type of laser) are uncertain. 
Lumbar provocation discography Procedure that is used to characterize the pathoanatomy and architecture of the intervertebral disc and to determine if the intervertebral disc is a source of chronic low back pain. 
Lumbar supports External devices designed to reduce spinal mobility. 
Massage Soft tissue manipulation using the hands or a mechanical device through a variety of specific methods. The pressure and intensity used in different massage techniques vary widely. 
Motorized traction An intervention involving drawing or pulling in order to stretch the lumbar spine. Various methods are used, usually involving a harness around the lower rib cage and the iliac crest, with the pulling action done by using free weights and a pulley, motorized equipment, inversion techniques, or an overhead harness. 
MRI Magnetic resonance imaging; an imaging technique used to image internal structures of the body, particularly the soft tissues without use of radiation. 
Multidisciplinary therapy (multidisciplinary treatment programs) See Interdisciplinary rehabilitation. 
Nonspecific low back pain Pain occurring primarily in the back with no signs of a serious underlying condition (such as cancer, infection, or cauda equina syndrome), spinal stenosis or radiculopathy, or another specific spinal cause (such as vertebral compression fracture or ankylosing spondylitis). Degenerative changes on lumbar imaging are usually considered nonspecific, as they correlate poorly with symptoms.  28 
 Low Back Pain Appendix D Glossary Low Back Pain 
Osteopathic 
physician The training of osteopathic physicians incorporates the diagnosis, treatment, prevention and rehabilitation of musculoskeletal conditions. Osteopathic manual therapy, including manipulation, can be an important part of treatment. 
Physiotherapy provided operant conditioning Operant conditioning is defined as a time contingent, graduated increase in activity including goal setting and the education and reinforcement of positive pain behaviours with the ultimate aim of decreasing disability and increasing function. 
Prevention of occurrence of low back pain Reduction of the incidence (first-time onset) of low back pain or the risk of new cases appearing, i.e. primary prevention. 
Prevention of recurrence of low back pain Reduction of the occurrence of a new episode of low back pain after a symptom-free period in patients who have previously experienced low back pain, i.e., secondary prevention. 
Progressive (muscle) relaxation A technique which involves the deliberate tensing and relaxation of muscles, in order to facilitate the recognition and release of muscle tension. 
Prolotherapy Injections of irritant solutions to strengthen lumbosacral ligaments. 
Proton pump inhibitor A type of drug that reduces the production of acid in the stomach, and is used to treat indigestion and stomach ulcers. 
Radiculopathy Dysfunction of a nerve root associated with pain, sensory impairment, weakness, or diminished deep tendon reflexes in a nerve root distribution. The most common symptom of lumbar radiculopathy is sciatica. Sciatica is defined as pain radiating down the leg below the knee in the distribution of the sciatic nerve, suggesting nerve root compromise due to mechanical pressure or inflammation. 
Red flags Clinical (i.e. physical) features that may alert to the presence of serious but relatively uncommon conditions or diseases requiring evaluation. Such conditions include tumours, infection, fractures, and neurological damage/ disease. 
Short-wave diathermy Therapeutic elevation of the temperature of deep tissues by application of short-wave electromagnetic radiation with a frequency range from 10–100 MHz. 
Spa therapy An intervention involving several interventions, including mineral water bathing, usually with heated water, and other interventions such as massage and exercise, typically while staying at a spa resort. 
Spinal care specialist A physical therapist, chiropractor, osteopathic physician, or physician who specializes in musculoskeletal medicine.  29 
 Low Back PainAppendix D Glossary Low Back Pain 
Spinal fusion A procedure that involves fusing together two or more vertebrae in 
the spine using either bone grafts or metal rods 
Spinal manipulative therapy Application of high-velocity, low-amplitude manual thrusts to the spinal joints slightly beyond the passive range of joint motion. 
Spinal mobilization Application of manual force to the spinal joints within the passive range of joint motion that does not involve a thrust. 
TENS Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation; use of a small, battery-operated device to provide continuous electrical impulses via surface electrodes, with the goal of providing symptomatic relief by modifying pain perception. 
Therapeutic aquatic exercise Active exercise in warm water; such as aqua-aerobics and aqua-jogging. 
Therapeutic ultrasound The use of, externally applied sound waves to generate heat within specific parts of the body. 
Touch therapies Touch therapies are defined as energy based complementary therapies including healing touch, therapeutic touch, and Reiki. 
Yellow flags Psychosocial and sociological factors that increase the risk of developing or perpetuating long-term disability and work loss associated with low back pain. 
Yoga An intervention distinguished from traditional exercise therapy by the use of specific body positions, breathing techniques, and an emphasis on mental focus. Many styles of yoga are practiced, each emphasizing different postures and techniques. Iyengar yoga: A type of hatha yoga; make use of a variety of props so that perfect alignment is obtained regardless of physical limitations. 
Viniyoga: A type of hatha yoga customized by the practitioner for 
each individual. 
Other types of hatha yoga include: Ashtanga, Kripalu, Bikram, 
Anusara.  30 
 
 
   
 
 Low Back PainAppendix E Evidence Source Low Back Pain 
The Evidence Source provides information on the “seed” guideline(s) that were used to de -
velop the Alberta guideline recommendations and the design of the studies referenced by the 
seed guideline(s) in support of their recommendations. 
The following evidence sources were considered: 
• Systematic review (SR): as cited by the seed guideline(s) or identified from a 
supplementary literature search (IHE Database) required by the Ambassador Guideline Development Group (GDG). The literature search spanned from January 1996 to August 2007 for the first edition of this guideline and from January 2002 to December 2010 for the second edition. 
• Randomized controlled trial (RCT): as cited by the seed guideline(s); 
• Case series (CS): as cited by the seed guideline(s); 
• Guideline (G): as cited by the seed guideline(s); 
• Expert opinion (EO) as cited by the seed guideline(s): when no evidence was provided by the “seed” guideline(s) in support of the recommendation; 
• EO (GDG): after examining the individual studies cited by the seed guideline(s) or other reference guidelines, or additional SRs identified by a supplementary literature search spanning from January 1996 to December 2010 (see above), a new recommendation was drafted based on the collective EO of the Ambassador GDG. 
For evidence cited by the seed guideline(s), only the highest level of evidence was listed. For example, when the evidence cited by a seed guideline was from SRs and studies of other design (i.e. RCT, CS, or G) only SR is listed as the source. When no SR was referenced in the seed guideline, the evidence source was indicated in the following order: RCT, CS, G, EO. The same classification for the evidence source was applied when multiple seed guidelines were used to inform one recommendation. 
Each recommendation in the Alberta guideline came from one or more seed guidelines or was 
created by the GDG, based on their collective professional opinion and an analysis of relevant 
evidence.   Low Back PainAppendix F
