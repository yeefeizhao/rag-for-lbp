Description: The American College of Physicians (ACP) and
American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) developed thisguideline to provide clinical recommendations on nonpharmaco-logicandpharmacologicmanagementofacutepainfromnon–lowback,musculoskeletalinjuriesinadultsintheoutpatientsetting.Theguidance is based on current best available evidence about bene-ﬁts and harms, taken in the context of costs and patient values andpreferences.Thisguidelinedoesnotaddressnoninvasivetreatmentoflowbackpain,whichiscoveredbyaseparateACPguidelinethathas also been endorsed by AAFP.
Methods: Thisguidelineisbasedonasystematicevidencereview
on the comparative efﬁcacy and safety of nonpharmacologic andpharmacologic management of acute pain from non–low back,musculoskeletalinjuriesinadultsintheoutpatientsettingandasys-tematicreviewonthepredictorsofprolongedopioiduse.Weeval-uatedthefollowingclinicaloutcomesusingtheGRADE(GradingofRecommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) sys-tem: pain (at ≤2 hours and at 1 to 7 days), physical function, symp-tom relief, treatment satisfaction, and adverse events.
Target Audience and Patient Population: The target audi-
ence is all clinicians, and the target patient population is adultswith acute pain from non–low back, musculoskeletal injuries.
Recommendation 1: ACP and AAFP recommend that clinicians
treat patients with acute pain from non–low back, musculoskeletalinjuries with topical nonsteroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs (NSAIDs)with or without menthol gel as ﬁrst-line therapy to reduce or relievesymptoms, including pain; improve physical function; and improve
the patient's treatment satisfaction (Grade: strong recommendation;moderate-certainty evidence).
Recommendation 2a: ACP and AAFP suggest that clinicians
treat patients with acute pain from non–low back, musculoskeletal
injuries with oral NSAIDs to reduce or relieve symptoms, includ-ing pain, and to improve physical function, or with oral acetamin-ophen to reduce pain (Grade: conditional recommendation;moderate-certainty evidence).
Recommendation 2b: ACP and AAFP suggest that clinicians
treat patients with acute pain from non–low back, musculoskeletalinjuries with speciﬁc acupressure to reduce pain and improvephysical function, or with transcutaneous electrical nerve stimula-tion to reduce pain (Grade: conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence).
Recommendation 3: ACP and AAFP suggest against clinicians
treating patients with acute pain from non–low back, musculosk-eletal injuries with opioids, including tramadol (Grade: condi-tional recommendation; low-certainty evidence).

Musculoskeletal injuries are common and are most
frequently treated in outpatient settings. In 2010,
they accounted for more than 65 million health carevisits in the United States and 4 of 5 injuries that weretreated in a physician's ofﬁce were musculoskeletal (1) .
The estimated annual cost of treating musculoskeletalinjuries was $176.1 billion in 2010 (1) .See also:

Downloaded from https://annals.org by Yi-Fei Zhao on 07/01/2024. Acute musculoskeletal pain lasts less than 4 weeks
and includes strains and sprains, soft tissue injuries,whiplash, and various other conditions ranging fromnonsurgicalfracturestocontusions(2).Numeroustreat-ment options exist, including nonpharmacologic andpharmacologic interventions (nonopioid and opioid)(3–6). In the United States, approximately one ﬁfth ofpatients presenting with pain in the outpatient settingreceive an opioid prescription (7) and opioid prescrip-tions for acute musculoskeletal injuries, such as anklesprains, are common (8, 9). As of 2015, 2 million personshad an opioid use disorder involving prescription opioids(10), although prescribing rates have decreased in recentyears.
GUIDELINE FOCUS AND TARGETPOPULATION
The purpose of this guideline from the American
College of Physicians (ACP) and American Academy ofFamily Physicians (AAFP) is to present clinical recom-mendations on nonpharmacologic and pharmacologicmanagement of acute, non–low back, musculoskeletalinjuries in adults in outpatient settings based on thebest available evidence of the beneﬁts and harms oftreatmentandconsiderationofcostsandpatientvaluesand preferences. This guideline does not address non-invasive treatment of low back pain, which is coveredby a separate ACP guideline that was endorsed byAAFP (6).
The target audience for this guideline is all clini-
cians, and the target patient population is adults withacute pain from non–low back, musculoskeletal injuries.
METHODS
This guideline was jointly developed by ACP's Clin-
ical Guidelines Committee (CGC) and representativesfrom AAFP according to ACP's guideline developmentprocess, details of which can be found in the methodspapers (11, 12). This guideline is based on 2 systematicevidence reviews: a network meta-analysis on the com-parative efﬁcacy and safety of nonpharmacologic andpharmacologictreatmentsforacutemusculoskeletalin-juries (2) and a systematic review on the predictors ofprolonged opioid use (13). Both were done by an evi-dence review team at McMaster University and fundedby the National Safety Council (2, 13), which had norole in the development, review, or approval of thisguideline or the 2 systematic evidence reviews.
Systematic Evidence Reviews
The accompanying systematic evidence reviews (2,
13) and the Appendix (available at Annals.org) provide
details and methods. Reviewers searched several data-bases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and refer-ence lists from included trials and guidelines. They se-lected studies published between database inceptionand 2 January 2020 that assessed adults aged 18 yearsor older with acute musculoskeletal pain in the outpa-tientsetting.Acutepainwasdeﬁnedaslastinglessthan4 weeks, and studies assessing the treatment of lowback pain were excluded.Main Outcomes
The network meta-analysis evaluated the following
outcomes: pain relief (at ≤2 hours and at 1 to 7 days);physical function; symptom relief; treatment satisfac-tion; and gastrointestinal (GI), dermatologic, and neu-rologic adverse events. Pain relief and function werereported as mean score differences on a 10-cm visualanalogue scale (VAS) using a minimally important dif-ferenceof1cm,whereassymptomrelief,treatmentsat-isfaction, and adverse events were reported as dichot-omous outcomes. Deﬁnitions of treatment satisfactionand symptom relief varied across studies and are sum-marized in detail in the supplement of the networkmeta-analysis (2). Treatment satisfaction was typicallydeﬁnedasthepatient'soverallassessmentoftreatmentsatisfaction or efﬁcacy (for example, very satisﬁed orsatisﬁed vs. very unsatisﬁed or unsatisﬁed, or good toexcellent vs. otherwise). Symptom relief was commonlydeﬁned as reaching full resolution of symptoms (for ex-ample, no pain, symptom-free, or full relief) or as amarked response to treatment (for example, ≥50% re-duction in pain score). A second review identiﬁed riskfactors for prolonged opioid use after a prescription totreat acute musculoskeletal pain (13).
Values and Preferences
The CGC searched several databases (Trip, Episte-
monikos, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Tri-als, and PubMed) to identify systematic reviews on val-uesandpreferencesforthemanagementofacutepain.The development of this guideline also included per-spectives, values, and preferences of 2 CGC memberswho represent the public and the CGC Public Panel,who provided comments on the guideline.
Costs
The CGC searched for fair prices of the included
interventions via Healthcare Bluebook. If no fair pricewas publicly available, costs were sourced from theMedicare Physician Fee Schedule (national average,health care professional, and nonfacility payment).
Evidence to Recommendations
UsingGRADE(GradingofRecommendationsAssess-
ment, Development and Evaluation) methodology (14),the CGC based this guideline on an assessment of thebeneﬁtsandharmsoftheinterventionsandconsiderationof costs and patient values and preferences ( Figure 1 ).
The tables in Supplement 1 (available at Annals.org) illus-
trate the GRADE evidence-to-decision framework sup-porting the recommendations. When evaluating the evi-dence on beneﬁts and harms, the CGC reviewed resultsfrom both the direct evidence and the network meta-analysis and used the highest-certainty evidence that wasavailable regardless of whether it was derived from a di-rect or network estimate.
Peer Review
The guideline underwent a peer review process
through the journal and was posted online for com-mentsfromACPRegentsandACPGovernors,whorep-resent internal medicine and its subspecialty physicianmembers at the national and international levels. TheCLINICAL GUIDELINE Clinical Guideline on Management of Non–Low Back, Musculoskeletal Pain

SUMMARY OF THE EVIDENCE
The network meta-analysis included 207 trials com-
prising 32 959 patients; the median of mean patientages was 34 years (interquartile range, 28 to 39 years).Causes of acute pain varied: 48% of studies included amix of musculoskeletal injuries, 29% enrolled patientswith sprains, 6% enrolled those with whiplash, 5% en-rolled those with muscle strains, and the remaining tri-als included various other injuries ranging from nonsur-gical fractures to contusions (2). Twenty-nine percent ofstudies enrolled persons with isolated ankle injuries,26% various injuries, 11% neck injuries, 9% upper- andlower-limb injuries, and 7% isolated upper-limb inju-ries; 7% did not specify a location, and the remainingstudies enrolled those with isolated injuries to the ham-string muscle, knee, lower limb, hip, elbow, chest, orribs. The median average pain score for patients atbaseline was 6.49 cm on a 10-cm VAS (2). The system-atic review on predictors of prolonged use included 13observational studies with 13 263 393 participants, in-cluding those with work injuries, ankle sprains, lowback pain, or several acute pain complaints. Deﬁnitionsof prolonged use varied across studies.
Beneﬁts of Nonpharmacologic and
Pharmacologic Treatments Versus Placebo
Pain Relief at Less Than 2 Hours
Evidence was gathered from 28 RCTs with 4464
patients (2).
Nonpharmacologic Treatments. Moderate-certaintyev-
idence showed that on a 10-cm VAS, massage therapy re-
duced pain at less than 2 hours (weighted mean differ-ence [WMD], /H110020.70 cm [95% CI, /H110021.27 to /H110020.13 cm]).
Low-certainty evidence showed that speciﬁc acupressure(WMD, /H110021.59 cm [CI, /H110022.52 to /H110020.66 cm]), joint manipu-
lation therapy (WMD, /H110021.75 cm [CI, /H110022.68 to /H110020.81 cm]),
and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS)(WMD, /H110021.94 cm [CI, /H110022.90 to /H110020.98 cm]) reduced pain
at less than 2 hours compared with placebo. Low-certainty evidence showed no statistically signiﬁcant dif-ference in pain at less than 2 hours between nonspeciﬁcacupressure and placebo.
Pharmacologic Treatments. High-certainty evidence
showedthat on a 10-cm VAS, acetaminophen plus opi-
oids reduced pain at less than 2 hours (WMD, /H110020.50
cm [CI, /H110021.00 to /H110020.01 cm]), although the effect was
small and based on a single study. Moderate-certaintyevidence showed that the following interventions alsoreduced pain at less than 2 hours compared with pla-cebo: acetaminophen alone (WMD, /H110021.03 cm [CI,
/H110021.82 to /H110020.24 cm]), acetaminophen plus oral diclofe-
nac (WMD, /H110021.11 cm [CI, /H110022.00 to /H110020.21 cm]), oral
nonsteroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (WMD,/H110020.93 cm [CI, /H110021.49 to /H110020.37 cm]), topical NSAIDs
(WMD, /H110021.02 cm [CI, /H110021.64 to /H110020.39 cm]), and topical
NSAIDs plus menthol gel (WMD, /H110021.68 cm [CI, /H110023.09
to/H110020.27 cm]). Low-certainty evidence showed that a
single dose of transbuccal fentanyl (WMD, /H110023.52 cm
[CI,/H110024.99 to /H110022.04 cm]) reduced pain at less than 2
hours compared with placebo; however, the direct ev-idence was based on a small, single-center study ( n=
60) that included mostly patients with severe pain (sus-pected fractures). Low-certainty evidence also showedthat acetaminophen plus ibuprofen plus codeine(WMD, /H110021.36 cm [CI, /H110022.49 to /H110020.23 cm]) reduced
pain at less than 2 hours.

Low-certainty evidence indicated that thefollowing combination treatments did not show statisti-cally signiﬁcant pain reduction at less than 2 hourscompared with placebo: acetaminophen plus ibupro-fen and ibuprofen plus cyclobenzaprine.
Pain Relief at 1 to 7 Days
Evidence was gathered from 69 RCTs with 10 829
patients (2).
Nonpharmacologic Treatments. Moderate-certaintyev-
idenceshowed that on a 10-cm VAS, speciﬁc acupres-
sure decreased pain (WMD, /H110022.09 cm [CI, /H110022.85 to
/H110021.33 cm]) and supervised rehabilitation increased
pain at 1 to 7 days (WMD, 1.06 [CI, 0.74 to 1.38 cm])compared with placebo. Low-certainty evidenceshowed that TENS (WMD, /H110021.18 cm [ /H110022.09 to /H110020.28
cm]) reduced pain at 1 to 7 days compared with pla-cebo. The following interventions did not show statisti-cally signiﬁcant pain reduction at 1 to 7 days comparedwith placebo: ultrasound therapy (moderate-certaintyevidence) and nonspeciﬁc acupressure, exercise, andlaser therapy (low-certainty evidence).
Pharmacologic Treatments. High-certainty evidence
showed that on a 10-cm VAS, acetaminophen plus opi-oids reduced pain at 1 to 7 days (WMD, /H110021.71 cm [CI,
/H110022.97 to /H110020.46 cm]). Moderate-certainty evidence
showed that the following interventions reduced painat 1 to 7 days compared with placebo: acetaminophenalone (WMD, /H110021.07 cm [CI, /H110021.89 to /H110020.24 cm]), oral
NSAIDs(WMD, /H110020.99cm[CI, /H110021.46to /H110020.52cm]),and
topical NSAIDs (WMD, /H110021.08 cm [CI, /H110021.40 to /H110020.75
cm]). Low-certainty evidence showed that acetamino-phen plus chlorzoxazone (WMD, /H110022.92 cm [CI, /H110025.41
to/H110020.43 cm]) also reduced pain at 1 to 7 days com-
pared with placebo.
The following treatments did not show statistically
signiﬁcant pain reduction at 1 to 7 days compared withplacebo: acetaminophen plus oral diclofenac, topicalNSAIDs plus menthol gel, and glucosamine (moderate-certainty evidence) and ibuprofen plus cycloben-zaprine, acetaminophen plus ibuprofen, cycloben-zaprine, and menthol gel (low-certainty evidence).
Physical Function
Evidence was gathered from 31 RCTs with 3549
patients (2).
Nonpharmacologic Treatments. Moderate-certaintyev-

signiﬁcant improvement in function compared withplacebo.
Treatment Satisfaction
Evidence was gathered from 17 studies with
10 390 patients (2).
Nonpharmacologic Treatments. Low-certaintyevidence
showed that speciﬁc and nonspeciﬁc acupressure andmobilization did not improve treatment satisfactioncompared with placebo.
Pharmacologic Treatments. High-certainty evidence
showed that topical NSAIDs provided more treatmentsatisfaction than placebo (OR, 5.20 [CI, 2.03 to 13.33]).The following interventions did not improve treatmentsatisfaction compared with placebo: oral NSAIDs(moderate-certainty evidence), acetaminophen aloneor plus oral diclofenac (moderate-certainty evidence),and ibuprofen plus cyclobenzaprine (low-certaintyevidence).
Symptom Relief
Evidence was gathered from 26 RCTs with 4067
patients (2).
Nonpharmacologic Treatments. Moderate-certaintyev-
idence showed that laser therapy improved symptomrelief (OR, 32.08 [CI, 6.55 to 157.2]), and low-certaintyevidence showed that mobilization improved symptomrelief (OR, 7.99 [CI, 1.29 to 49.41]). Low-certainty evi-dence showed that speciﬁc and nonspeciﬁc acupres-sure, TENS, and education did not have a statisticallysigniﬁcant effect on symptom relief.
Pharmacologic Treatments. High-certainty evidence
showed that acetaminophen plus opioids (OR, 1.44 [CI,1.03 to 2.03]) increased the likelihood of symptom re-lief compared with placebo. Moderate-certainty evi-denceshowedthatacetaminophenplusoraldiclofenac(OR,3.72[CI,1.02to13.52]),oralNSAIDs(OR,3.10[CI,1.39 to 6.91]), and topical NSAIDs (OR, 6.39 [CI, 3.48 to11.75])alsoimprovedsymptomrelief.Low-certaintyev-idence showed an improvement in symptom relief withtopical NSAIDs plus menthol gel (OR, 13.34 [CI, 3.30 to53.92]).

Moderate-certainty evidence showed thatacetaminophen plus oral diclofenac, oral NSAIDs, andtopical NSAIDs were among the most effective interven-tions for symptom relief.
Harms of Nonpharmacologic and Pharmacologic
Treatment
The systematic review pooled evidence from in-
cluded RCTs on dermatologic, GI, and neurologic ad-verse events.
Dermatologic Adverse Events
Thirty-nine studies comprising 7235 patients re-
ported dermatologic adverse events (2). The followingspeciﬁc adverse events were reported: application siteor local reactions, burning or hot-cold sensation, der-matitis, dry skin, edema, erythema, inﬂammation, irrita-tion,itching,lipothymia,pain,perspiration,pruritus,py-rexia, rash, and urticaria. Dermatologic adverse eventsdid not differ signiﬁcantly between any interventionand placebo.
GI Adverse Events
Forty-ﬁve studies comprising 7070 patients re-
ported GI adverse events (2). The following speciﬁc ad-verseeventswerereported:abdominalpainorcramps,bleeding,constipation,diarrhea,distension,drymouth,dyspepsia, epigastric pain or discomfort, ﬂatulence,gastritis,gastroenteritis,heartburn,indigestion,nausea,salivation, ulcer, and vomiting. Moderate-certainty evi-dence showed that transbuccal fentanyl (OR, 59.38 [CI,6.21 to 567.71]), acetaminophen plus opioids (OR, 5.63[CI, 2.84 to 11.16]), and oral NSAIDs (OR, 1.77 [CI, 1.33to 2.35]) increased risk for GI adverse events.
The following interventions did not show a statisti-
cally signiﬁcant increase in GI adverse events com-pared with placebo: laser therapy, topical NSAIDs, andtramadol (moderate-certainty evidence) and speciﬁcand nonspeciﬁc acupressure, joint manipulation, mobi-lization, exercise, supervised rehabilitation, TENS, cy-clobenzaprine, ibuprofen plus cyclobenzaprine, andacetaminophen alone or with chlorzoxazone (low-certainty evidence).
Neurologic Adverse Events
Thirty-eight studies comprising 6245 patients re-
ported neurologic adverse events (2). The followingspeciﬁc adverse events were reported: agitation, anxi-ety, blurred vision, confusion, dizziness, drowsiness,dysphoria, fatigue, headache, insomnia, lightheaded-ness, malaise, nerve palsies, nervousness, paresthesia,sedation, sleepiness, somnolence, tiredness, and ver-
tigo. High-certainty evidence showed that acetamino-phen plus opioids (OR, 3.53 [CI, 1.92 to 6.49]) in-creased neurologic adverse events more than placebo.Moderate-certainty evidence showed an increase inneurologic adverse events with tramadol (OR, 6.72 [CI,1.24 to 36.39]) and transbuccal fentanyl (OR, 5.73 [CI,1.20 to 27.47]), and low-certainty evidence showed anincrease with ibuprofen plus cyclobenzaprine (OR, 4.91[CI, 1.45 to 16.61]).
The following did not show a statistically signiﬁcant
increase in neurologic adverse events compared withplacebo: oral NSAIDs, laser therapy, and phenyramidol(moderate-certainty evidence) and speciﬁc and non-speciﬁc acupressure, exercise, mobilization, joint ma-nipulation, supervised rehabilitation, TENS, cycloben-zaprine, and topical NSAIDs (low-certainty evidence).
Comparative Harms of Nonpharmacologic and
Pharmacologic Treatments
Interventions that showed statistically signiﬁcant
harm compared with placebo and at least 1 other inter-vention were considered to be “among the most harm-ful” interventions. For neurologic adverse events, acet-aminophen plus opioids (high-certainty evidence) andtramadol alone (moderate-certainty evidence) wereamong the most harmful. For GI adverse events, acet-aminophenplusopioidsandtransbuccalfentanylalonewereamongthemostharmfulinterventions(moderate-certainty evidence).
Opioid Use–Related Harms: Predictors of
Prolonged Opioid Use
The evidence review team did a separate system-
atic review for predictors of prolonged opioid use aftera prescription to treat acute musculoskeletal pain (13).The overall prevalence of prolonged opioid use forlow-risk populations (that is, not receiving wage re-placement beneﬁts and having low representation ofsubstance use disorder) was 6% (CI, 4% to 8%).Moderate-certainty evidence showed an associationbetween prolonged opioid use and greater physicalcomorbidity (absolute risk increase [ARI], 0.9% [CI,0.1% to 1.7%]), age (ARI for every 10-year increase,1.1% [CI, 0.7% to 1.5%]), and past or present substanceuse disorder (ARI, 10.5% [4.2% to 19.8%]). Low-certainty evidence from studies that could not bepooled showed that prolonged opioid use was associ-ated with prescriptions lasting more than 7 days (ARIranged from 2% to 9%) and higher morphine milligramequivalents per day (ARI ranged from 2% to 13%).

COSTS
The evidence-to-decision table ( Supplement 1 ) re-
ports the costs of nonpharmacologic and pharmaco-logic treatments, and we limited this information tointerventions that showed a statistically signiﬁcant dif-ference for 1 or more outcomes.
INCONCLUSIVE AREAS OF EVIDENCE
Head-to-head comparisons to show superiority of
one intervention over another were lacking (2).
MULTIPLE CHRONIC CONDITIONS :CLINICAL
CONSIDERATIONS
Persons with more chronic conditions have a
higher probability of receiving opioids for prolongedperiods (13).
RECOMMENDATIONS
Figure 2 summarizes the recommendations and
clinical considerations.
Recommendation 1: ACP and AAFP recommend
that clinicians treat patients with acute pain from non–low
back, musculoskeletal injuries with topical NSAIDs with orwithout menthol gel as ﬁrst-line therapy to reduce or re-lieve symptoms, including pain; improve physical function;and improve the patient's treatment satisfaction (Grade:strong recommendation; moderate-certainty evidence).
Topical NSAIDs were the only intervention that im-
proved all outcomes in patients with acute pain fromnon–low back, musculoskeletal injuries. They wereamong the most effective interventions for treatmentsatisfaction (high-certainty evidence) and for pain re-ductionatlessthan2hoursandat1to7days;function;and symptom relief, which was generally deﬁned asmarked or full symptom resolution (moderate-certaintyevidence). Furthermore, topical NSAIDs were not asso-ciated with a statistically signiﬁcant increase in risk foradverse effects (low- to high-certainty evidence). Topi-cal NSAIDs plus menthol gel also improved pain at lessthan 2 hours (moderate-certainty evidence) and symp-tomrelief(low-certaintyevidence).Althoughthereisnoevidence that the combination provides additionalbeneﬁtovertopicalNSAIDsalone,harmsareunlikelytoincrease, and offering the combination therapy as an-other treatment option is reasonable. Because hetero-geneity in the presentation of acute pain is consider-able, topical NSAIDs may not always be appropriate
ﬁrst-line therapy, such as in cases of severe injury.
Recommendation 2a: ACP and AAFP suggest that
clinicians treat patients with acute pain from non–lowback, musculoskeletal injuries with oral NSAIDs to re-duce or relieve symptoms, including pain, and to im-prove physical function, or with oral acetaminophen toreduce pain (Grade: conditional recommendation;moderate-certainty evidence).
Recommendation 2b: ACP and AAFP suggest
that clinicians treat patients with acute pain from non–low back, musculoskeletal injuries with speciﬁcacupressure to reduce pain and improve physicalfunction, or with transcutaneous electrical nerve stim-ulation to reduce pain (Grade: conditional recom-mendation; low-certainty evidence).
Moderate-certainty evidence showed that oral
NSAIDs reduced pain at less than 2 hours and at 1 to 7daysaftertreatmentandwereassociatedwithagreaterlikelihood of symptom relief (generally deﬁned asmarked or complete symptom resolution) in patientswith acute pain from non–low back, musculoskeletal in-juries. There was also moderate-certainty evidence thatacetaminophen reduced pain at less than 2 hours andat 1 to 7 days. Oral NSAIDs were associated with in-creased risk for GI adverse events (moderate-certaintyevidence), including but not limited to GI bleeding, ab-dominal or stomach pain, constipation, diarrhea, dys-pepsia, nausea, and vomiting. The costs of oral NSAIDs
and acetaminophen did not differ substantially. Clini-cians should assess patients' risk factors (GI and renal)and treatment preferences in choosing between oralNSAIDs and acetaminophen.
Speciﬁc acupressure improved pain at 1 to 7 days
and function (moderate-certainty evidence), but onlylow-certainty evidence indicated that speciﬁc acupres-sure improved pain at less than 2 hours. Low-certaintyevidence suggested that TENS improved pain at lessthan 2 hours and at 1 to 7 days. Of note, deﬁnitions ofacupressure varied across trials and are summarized inthe accompanying network meta-analysis (2). The CGCcould not determine the cost of TENS or speciﬁc acu-pressure and therefore did not use cost considerationsto recommend one over the other.
The CGC recommended only interventions that im-
proved at least 2 outcomes, with the exception of acet-aminophen plus oral diclofenac because the CGCjudged that combination therapy offered no beneﬁtover single therapy and because the harms noted forsingle-therapy oral NSAIDs would apply to this combi-nation. Interventions that improved only 1 outcomewere massage therapy (moderate-certainty evidence),acetaminophen plus ibuprofen plus codeine (low-certainty evidence), and transbuccal fentanyl (low-certainty evidence) for pain at less than 2 hours; acet-aminophen plus chlorzoxazone and ibuprofen pluscyclobenzaprine for pain at 1 to 7 days after treatment(low-certainty evidence); and laser therapy for symp-tom relief (low-certainty evidence).

cluding tramadol (Grade: conditional recommendation;
low-certainty evidence).
High-certainty evidence showed that acetaminophen
plus opioids reduced pain at 1 to 7 days and improved
symptom relief; it also reduced pain at less than 2 hours,
but this effect was small and not clinically important. On
the other hand, none of the other 4 opioid interventions
(transbuccal fentanyl, tramadol, and acetaminophen plus
ibuprofen plus codeine or oxycodone) were associated
with improvements in more than 1 outcome. Moreover,
moderate- to high-certainty evidence indicated that opi-
oid interventions were associated with large increases in
risk for neurologic and GI adverse effects.
Evidence from observational studies also indicated
that a substantial proportion of patients who are pre-
scribed opioids for acute pain continue using prescrip-
tion opioids over the long term (27% among high-risk
populations and 6% among the general population).
Low-certainty evidence showed that longer prescribing
periods (&gt;7 days vs. 1 to 3 days) and higher morphine
milligram equivalents per day were predictors of risk
for prolonged use. The Public Panel and nonphysician
CGC members indicated that they would not select any
of the opioids because the harms outweigh the bene-
ﬁts. Combination therapies with opioids also cost more
than similar interventions without opioids, and many ef-
fective nonopioid alternatives exist for the manage-
mentofacutepain.Therefore,exceptincasesofsevere
injury or intolerance of ﬁrst-line therapies, clinicians
should avoid prescribing these therapies because they
are associated with substantial potential harms with lit-
tle or no beneﬁt and are associated with longer-term
addiction and overdose.

APPENDIX :DETAILED METHODS
A team at McMaster University conducted the sup-
porting evidence review. Details of the ACP guideline
development process can be found in ACP's methods
paper (11). Disclosure of interests and management of
any conﬂicts can be found at www.acponline.org/clinical
_information/guidelines/guidelines/conﬂicts_cgc.htm.
Key Questions Addressed
Theaccompanyingsystematicevidencereviewand
network meta-analysis (2) addressed the following key
question: In adult patients with acute (&lt;4 weeks), non–
low back, musculoskeletal pain in the outpatientsetting, what are the effectiveness and comparative ef-
fectiveness (beneﬁts and harms, both short-term and
long-term) of nonpharmacologic treatments, nonopi-
oid pharmacologic treatments, and opioid treatments?
An additional review (13) also addressed the fol-
lowing question: What factors are associated with pro-
longedopioiduseafterprescriptiontotreatacutemus-
culoskeletal pain in adults?
Search Strategy
Reviewers searched several databases (MEDLINE,
Embase, CINAHL, PEDro, and CENTRAL) for studies and
systematic reviews published from inception through
February 2018.
Quality Assessment
Reviewers assessed risk of bias as described in the
evidence reviews (2, 13).
Population Studied
The population studied was adults with acute pain
from non–low back, musculoskeletal injuries.
Interventions Evaluated
Interventions included both pharmacologic and
nonpharmacologic treatments for acute pain from non–
low back, musculoskeletal injuries.
Comparators
Interventions were compared versus placebo and
versus each other.
Outcomes
Outcomes were pain (at 15 minutes to 2 hours, 1 to
7 days, and 3 weeks to 6 months); function; symptom
relief; patient satisfaction; and GI, dermatologic, and
neurologic adverse events.
Target Audience
The target audience is all clinicians.
Target Patient Population
The target patient population is adults with acute
pain from non–low back, musculoskeletal injuries.
Public and Patient Involvement
The development of this guideline also included
perspectives, values, and preferences of 2 nonphysi-
cian CGC members who represent the public and a
7-member CGC Public Panel.
Peer Review
The supporting evidence review and guideline
each underwent a peer review process through the
journal. The guideline was posted online for comments
from ACP Regents and ACP Governors, who represent
internal medicine and its subspecialty physician mem-
bers at the national and international levels. It was also
reviewed by members of AAFP's Commission on
Health of the Public and Science.
