Also called: Hip arthroplasty, Hip prosthesis
Summary
Hip replacement is surgery for people with severe hip damage. The most common cause of damage is
osteoarthritis
. Osteoarthritis causes pain, swelling, and reduced motion in your joints. It can interfere with your daily activities. If other treatments such as physical therapy, pain medicines, and exercise haven't helped, hip replacement surgery might be an option for you.
During a hip replacement operation, the surgeon removes damaged cartilage and bone from your hip joint and replaces them with new, man-made parts.
A hip replacement can:
Relieve pain
Help your hip joint work better
Improve walking and other movements
The most common problem after surgery is hip dislocation. Because a man-made hip is smaller than the original joint, the ball can come out of its socket. The surgery can also cause blood clots and infections. With a hip replacement, you might need to avoid certain activities, such as jogging and high-impact sports.
