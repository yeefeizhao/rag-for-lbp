 Low Back Pain Clinical Care Standard
Quality statements
1 Initial clinical assessment 
The assessment of a patient with a new presentation of low back pain symptoms, with or 
without leg pain or other neurological symptoms, focuses on screening for specific and/or 
serious pathology and consideration of psychosocial factors. It includes a targeted history 
and physical examination, with a focused neurological examination when appropriate. 
Arrangements are made for follow-up based on an evidence-based low back pain pathway.
2 Psychosocial assessment 
Early in each new presentation, a patient with low back pain, with or without leg pain or other 
neurological symptoms, is screened and assessed for psychosocial factors that may affect their 
recovery. This includes assessing their understanding of, and concerns about, diagnosis and 
pain, and the impact of pain on their life. The assessment is repeated at subsequent visits to 
measure progress.
3 Reserve imaging for suspected serious pathology
Expectations of imaging and its limited role in diagnosing low back pain are discussed with a 
patient. Early and appropriate referral for imaging occurs when there are signs or symptoms 
of specific and/or serious pathology. The likelihood and significance of incidental findings are 
reported and discussed with the patient. 
4 Patient education and advice 
A patient with low back pain is provided with information about their condition and receives 
targeted advice to increase their understanding, and address their concerns and expectations. 
The potential benefits, risks and costs of medicines and other treatment options are discussed, 
and the patient is supported to ask questions and share in decisions about their care.
5 Encourage self-management and physical activity
A patient with low back pain is encouraged to stay active and continue, or return to, usual 
activity, including work, as soon as possible or feasible. Self-management strategies are 
discussed. The patient and clinician develop a plan together that includes practical advice to 
maximise function, and limit the impact of pain and other symptoms on daily life. The plan 
addresses individual needs and preferences.
6 Physical and/or psychological interventions
A patient with low back pain is offered physical and/or psychological interventions based 
on their clinical and psychosocial assessment findings. Therapy is targeted at overcoming 
identified barriers to recovery. 
7  Judicious use of pain medicines
A patient is advised that the goal of pain medicines is to enable physical activity, not to 
eliminate pain. If a medicine is prescribed, it is in accordance with the current Therapeutic 
Guidelines , with ongoing review of benefit and clear stopping goals. Anticonvulsants, 
benzodiazepines and antidepressants are avoided, because their risks often outweigh potential 
benefits, and there is evidence of limited effectiveness. Opioid analgesics are considered only in 
carefully selected patients, at the lowest dose for the shortest duration possible. 
8 Review and referral 
A patient with persisting or worsening symptoms, signs or function is reassessed at an early 
stage to determine the barriers to improvement. Referral for a multidisciplinary approach is 
considered. Specialist medical or surgical review is indicated for severe or progressive back or 
leg pain that is unresponsive to other therapy, progressive neurological deficits, or other signs 
of specific and/or serious pathology. 
Low Back Pain Clinical Care Standard 2022  | 1 Indicators for local monitoring
The following indicators will support healthcare services to monitor how well they 
are implementing the care recommended in this clinical care standard and are 
intended to support local quality improvement activities.
1 Initial clinical assessment 
Indicator 1a : Evidence of a locally approved low back pain assessment protocol. The protocol 
should specify the:
	■Assessment pathway to identify specific and/or serious underlying pathology
	■Locally endorsed validated tool(s) to support the initial assessment 
	■Process to ensure that clinicians are trained in the assessment protocol and endorsed tools
	■Pathway for follow-up care
	■Process to assess adherence to the protocol. 
Indicator 1b : Proportion of patients with acute low back pain with the findings of both their 
initial clinical assessment and screening for specific and/or serious underlying pathology 
documented in their medical record. 
2 Psychosocial assessment 
Indicator 2a : Evidence of a locally approved policy to ensure that patients are screened for 
psychosocial factors early in each new presentation. The policy should specify the:
	■Process to ensure that clinicians are trained in biopsychosocial pain management and 
identification of psychosocial factors associated with delayed recovery
	■Locally endorsed risk assessment tools available to support clinicians to complete early 
psychosocial assessment 
	■Referral pathways to appropriate clinicians with experience in pain management, and 
psychological and/or physical therapies 
	■Process to assess adherence to the policy. 
3 Reserve imaging for suspected serious pathology
Indicator 3a : Evidence of a locally approved policy to ensure the appropriate use of imaging 
for low back pain. The policy should specify the: 
	■Appropriate indications for imaging a patient with low back pain 
	■Locally endorsed educational tools and resources that should be used to support 
discussions about appropriate imaging and interpretation of findings with patients 
	■Process to assess adherence to the policy.
Indicator 3b : Proportion of patients with a new episode of low back pain referred for imaging 
for whom an appropriate indication for imaging is documented in the medical record.

 4 Patient education and advice
Indicator 4a : Evidence of local arrangements to ensure that patients are provided with 
information, advice and reassurance. The local arrangements should specify: 
	■The information a patient with low back pain should receive about their condition
	■That a patient with low back pain is asked about their concerns related to their back pain 
and their expectations about management of their condition 
	■The process in place to assess whether a patient’s concerns related to their low back pain 
have been addressed during the consultation.
5 Encourage self-management and physical activity
Indicator 5a : Proportion of patients with low back pain who have documented discussions in 
their medical record about both self-management strategies and staying active by continuing 
usual activities.
6 Physical and/or psychological interventions
Indicator 6a : Proportion of patients with low back pain at risk of poor outcomes who were 
referred to physical and/or psychological clinical services.
Indicator 6b : Evidence of a locally approved policy that specifies the referral pathways to 
clinicians who provide appropriate physical and/or psychological therapies.
7 Judicious use of pain medicines
Indicator 7a : Proportion of patients with low back pain who received an opioid analgesic.
Indicator 7b : Proportion of patients with low back pain who received an anticonvulsant.
8 Review and referral 
Indicator 8a : Evidence of a locally approved policy that defines the process for review and 
referral of patients with low back pain. The policy should specify the:
	■Indications and timelines for when a patient with low back pain should be reassessed to 
reconsider their diagnosis and treatment plan
	■Referral pathways to appropriate healthcare providers and programs to support recovery
	■Mechanisms to facilitate effective communication between healthcare providers and 
the patient 
	■Process to monitor the effectiveness of the recommended treatment(s).

Low Back Pain Clinical Care Standard 2022  | 3 Clinical care standards 
Clinical care standards help support the delivery of evidence-based clinical care 
and promote shared decision making between patients, carers and clinicians. They 
aim to ensure that people receive best-practice care for a specific clinical condition 
or procedure, regardless of where they are treated in Australia. 
A clinical care standard contains a small number 
of quality statements that describe the level of 
clinical care expected for a specific clinical condition 
or procedure. Indicators are included for some 
quality statements to assist healthcare services to 
monitor how well they are implementing the care 
recommended in the clinical care standard.
A clinical care standard differs from a clinical 
practice guideline. Rather than describing all the 
components of care for a specific clinical condition 
or procedure, a clinical care standard focuses 
on key areas of care where the need for quality 
improvement is greatest. 
Clinical care standards aim to improve healthcare 
outcomes by describing key components of 
appropriate care, enabling:
	■Patients and the community to understand 
the care that is recommended and their 
healthcare choices
	■Clinicians to provide best-practice care
	■Healthcare services to monitor their performance 
and make improvements in the care 
they provide.Clinical care standards are developed by the 
Australian Commission on Safety and Quality 
in Health Care (the Commission), an Australian 
Government agency that leads and coordinates 
national improvements in the safety and quality of 
health care, based on the best available evidence. 
By working in partnership with the Australian 
Government, states and territories, the private 
sector, clinical experts, and consumers and carers, 
the Commission aims to ensure that the health 
system is better informed, supported and organised 
to deliver safe and high-quality care.

 About the Low Back Pain 
Clinical Care Standard
Context
Low back pain is a common form of back problem 
that affects most people at some point in their 
lives.1 As well as pain, it often leads to psychological 
distress and poorer quality of life2-4, and is a leading 
cause of disability worldwide.5 
In Australia, back problems are the number one 
cause of lost work productivity, early retirement and 
income poverty and a common reason for visiting 
emergency departments.6-12 In 2018–19, more money 
was spent on managing musculoskeletal disorders, 
including back problems, than any other category of 
disease, condition or injury in Australia.13
The Australian Atlas of Healthcare Variation  series  
has identified marked variation across Australia 
relevant to the care of low back pain, including in:
	■Computed tomography (CT) of the lumbar spine14
	■Opioid medicine use14,15
	■Lumbar spinal surgery.14-17
The Second Australian Atlas of Healthcare Variation  
(second Atlas) identified a need for comprehensive 
Australian guidance on the early management of 
low back pain, based on the National Institute for 
Health and Care Excellence guideline Low Back Pain 
and Sciatica in Over 16s: Assessment and management , 
and other relevant high-quality Australian and 
international evidence.16 The second Atlas recommended that the Australian 
guidance support appropriate early management, 
and ensure that patients are informed about and 
understand the range of treatment options available 
for low back pain, their risks and their likelihood 
of benefit.16 
Improved uptake of guideline recommendations 
for management of low back pain has been shown 
to result in better patient outcomes, such as in the 
extent and rate of recovery and a reduced need for 
ongoing care.18,19 It could also lead to more judicious 
use of imaging; lead to more appropriate use of 
opioids, other medicines and invasive therapies; 
and ultimately mean that more patients receive 
high-value care.9,20-22
This clinical care standard describes the key 
components of care that patients should receive 
when they have low back pain, with or without 
leg pain. 
Goals
	■To improve the early assessment, management, 
review and appropriate referral of patients with 
low back pain
	■To reduce the use of investigations and 
treatments that may be ineffective or 
unnecessary in managing low back pain.
Low Back Pain Clinical Care Standard 2022  | 5 Scope
This clinical care standard relates to the care that 
should be received by patients aged 16 years 
and over who present with low back pain, with 
or without leg pain. It covers the early clinical 
assessment, management, and review and referral 
of people with low back pain symptoms who 
present with a new acute episode. 
Although this standard does not cover the ongoing 
management of chronic low back pain, it does 
include the early management of patients with 
an acute episode, recurrence or exacerbation of 
chronic low back pain; such patients may progress 
more quickly to referral and further assessment. 
See Figure 1  for an overview of the scope of care 
described in this clinical care standard.
Healthcare settings
This clinical care standard applies to all healthcare 
settings where such care is provided, especially:
	■Primary healthcare services
	■Emergency departments.
The clinical care standard is of particular 
relevance to:
	■General practitioners
	■Allied health providers, including 
physiotherapists, pharmacists, psychologists, 
chiropractors, occupational therapists, 
osteopaths and paramedics 
	■Emergency physicians
	■Nurses and nurse practitioners.
It may also be relevant in other specialist services 
that provide care within the scope of this standard.
Not all quality statements in this clinical care 
standard will be applicable to every healthcare 
service or clinical unit. Healthcare services 
should consider their individual circumstances in 
determining how to apply each statement. 
Implementation should consider the context in 
which care is provided, local variation and the 
quality improvement priorities of the individual 
healthcare service. What is not covered
This clinical care standard does not cover:
	■Delivery of surgical interventions or their 
indications for use (for example, fusion and disc 
replacement, discectomy, laminectomy)
	■Ongoing management of low back pain persisting 
longer than 12 weeks, beyond the initial 
management of an acute exacerbation (although 
many of the principles of care described may still 
be relevant)9
	■Diagnosis or treatment of specific causes of low 
back pain, such as
 −inflammatory conditions (for example, axial 
spondyloarthritis)
 −infections (for example, discitis, osteomyelitis, 
epidural abscess)
 −fracture
 −neoplasm
 −metabolic bone disease (for example, 
osteoporotic fracture, Paget’s disease)
 −non-spinal causes of back pain
 −degenerative spinal disorders.

About the Low Back Pain Clinical Care Standard Terminology
Term How it is used in this document
Low back pain Symptoms of pain located between the lower rib margins and the buttock creases. 
These symptoms are commonly accompanied by pain in one or both legs, and some 
people have associated neurological symptoms in the lower limbs.23
‘Low back pain’ is used in this document to describe pain that does not have a 
diagnosed cause, but is not considered to be associated with specific or serious 
pathology, based on either clinical assessment or investigations. This has been 
described in the literature as ‘non-specific’, ‘not specified’, ‘undiagnosed’, ‘mechanical’ 
or ‘musculoskeletal’ low back pain. 
Low back pain may be acute or chronic, referring to the duration of symptoms.
Leg pain Pain that radiates into one or both legs; the terms ‘radicular pain’ and ‘sciatica’ are 
both used in international guidelines.
Clinician Any healthcare provider, including registered and non-registered practitioners, 
who provide direct clinical care to patients, including doctors, nurses, paramedics, 
pharmacists, Aboriginal health practitioners and physiotherapists.
Healthcare 
servicesHealthcare services are delivered in a wide range of settings, and vary in size and 
organisational structure from single healthcare providers to complex organisations. 
Where ‘healthcare services’ is used in this standard, it refers to those responsible for 
leading and governing the service.
Specific and/or 
serious pathologyRecognised pathological causes of low back pain symptoms – for example, vertebral 
fracture, malignancy, infection or cauda equina syndrome. 
Note: The term ‘specific and/or serious pathology’ is used in preference to 
‘red flags’.
The term ‘red flags’ is commonly used to refer to history or clinical findings that 
are believed to increase the likelihood of a serious diagnosis. However, nearly 
all commonly recommended individual red flags are uninformative and do not 
substantially change pre-test probabilities of a serious pathology, hence the term ‘red 
flags’ has not been used.23 
Psychosocial 
factors that may 
affect recoveryFactors that are associated with an increased risk of developing disability in people 
presenting with low back pain. The term ‘yellow flags’ is commonly used in the 
literature, but is not used in this clinical care standard.

About the Low Back Pain Clinical Care Standard How to use this clinical care standard
The quality statements describe the expected 
standard for key components of patient care. 
The standard explains what each quality 
statement means:
	■For patients , so they know what care may be 
offered by their healthcare system
	■For clinicians , to support decisions about 
appropriate care
	■For healthcare services , to inform them of the 
policies, procedures and organisational factors 
that can enable the delivery of high-quality care. 
General principles of care 
This clinical care standard should be implemented 
as part of an overall approach to safety and quality, 
incorporating the following principles that are the 
foundation for achieving safe and high-quality care: 
	■Person-centred care and shared decision making
	■Informed consent
	■Cultural safety for Aboriginal and Torres Strait 
Islander people
	■Equity of care for people from diverse 
backgrounds. 
When applying the information contained in a 
clinical care standard, clinicians are advised to 
use their clinical judgement and to consider the 
individual patient’s circumstances, in consultation 
with the patient or their support people. 
For more information and additional Commission 
resources, see Appendix A . Measurement for 
quality improvement 
Measurement is a key component of quality 
improvement processes. The Commission has 
developed a set of indicators to support clinicians 
and healthcare services to monitor how well they 
are implementing the care recommended in this 
clinical care standard. The indicators are intended 
to support local quality improvement activities. No 
benchmarks are set for these indicators.
The indicators are listed with the relevant quality 
statements. The definitions required to collect and 
calculate indicator data are available online: meteor.
aihw.gov.au/content/755790 . More information 
about indicators and other quality improvement 
measures is provided in  Appendix B .
Information on other quality measures, including 
patient-reported outcome measures and patient 
experience measures, is in Appendix C . 
Meeting the requirements 
of national standards 
and accreditation
Implementing this clinical care standard as part of a 
quality improvement activity can help: 
	■Acute healthcare services meet actions within 
the National Safety and Quality Health Service 
(NSQHS) Standards36
	■Primary care services meet actions within 
the National Safety and Quality Primary and 
Community Healthcare Standards (Primary and 
Community Healthcare Standards).37

Healthcare Standards is in Appendix D . 
Low Back Pain Clinical Care Standard 2022  | 9 Background: Low back pain
About 1 in 6 Australians report having back 
problems, which include a range of musculoskeletal 
conditions related to the back.3 Low back pain 
is the most common form of back problem and 
contributes significantly to the burden of back 
problems and musculoskeletal pain in Australia 
and globally.3,5,38 This burden is increasing and is 
expected to continue to increase with the ageing 
population.1,3,5,38 Back problems are the second 
most common reason Australians seek care from 
their general practitioner7, and a leading cause of 
presentation to emergency departments in Australia 
and throughout the world.6,39
Low back pain refers to pain felt in the lower part of 
the spine (lumbar spine) located between the 12th 
rib and the inferior buttock crease.40 It is commonly 
accompanied by pain in one or both legs.23
Most people will have low back pain at some 
point in their life35,38 and more commonly during 
middle or older age.1,3,6,7,9-11,41 Not all people who 
experience low back pain will seek care42-44 as new 
episodes are typically brief and resolve quickly 
on their own.45 For people who do consult a 
healthcare provider, most improve rapidly with 
primary care management within the first six 
weeks of presentation, and without the need for 
further investigation, referral or presentation to the 
emergency department for care.8,9,24,40,46,47 After six 
weeks, recovery is slower, but most people can still 
achieve minimal pain and disability at one year – 
particularly if they present early in the acute episode 
for care.8 
Nonetheless, recurrence is common and is 
responsible for much of the burden of low back 
pain.48,49 About one-quarter of people who initially 
recover from an acute episode have additional 
episodes within a year.49 For a small proportion of 
patients, low back pain can become a persistent or 
chronic condition that recurs episodically or remains 
present but with exacerbations.43 Once this occurs, 
management can be more challenging, with slower 
time to recovery.8,9,23,47-50There is broad international consensus on the best 
ways to manage low back pain. Early appropriate 
management may reduce the risk of recurrence 
and progression to persistent or chronic low 
back pain.4,8,47-49,51,52 Guideline recommendations 
include: 
	■Risk stratification to identify patients who 
may be at risk of a poor outcome, using a 
biopsychosocial model
	■Initial management in primary care with non-
invasive treatments that focus on improving 
function and addressing psychosocial factors46 
through self-management, including physical and 
psychological therapies 
	■Limiting the use of medicines, even commonly 
used analgesics such as non-steroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and paracetamol.  
For several reasons, many people do not receive 
guideline-recommended care.46,53 A recent 
systematic review of 195,000 patients across seven 
countries, including Australia, found that overuse 
of imaging and opioid medicines, and underuse of 
advice and information, were common in patients 
presenting with low back pain to primary healthcare 
providers and emergency departments. Specifically:
	■Imaging was received by one-quarter of patients 
with low back pain in primary care, and one-third 
of patients in emergency departments
	■Less than half overall received appropriate 
medicines; one-third of patients in primary care 
and up to two-thirds of patients in emergency 
departments received opioids
	■Only 1 in 5 patients in primary care received 
advice and information from their healthcare 
provider that aligned with guideline 
recommendations.54 
A Canadian study also found that many patients 
managed in primary care did not receive adequate 
treatment before referral to a surgeon. The authors 
suggested that patients without adequate 
initial treatment may be at risk of developing 
persistent or worsening back pain while awaiting 
surgical assessment.21 
10 | Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care
 Biopsychosocial assessment 
and management
Screening for serious pathology is universally 
endorsed in guidelines (such as for malignancy, 
vertebral fracture, infection or inflammatory 
disorders).9 However, such pathology comprises 
less than 1% of cases in primary care.23,55 Use of 
a biopsychosocial model to inform assessment 
and management of low back pain without 
a specific nociceptive source is consistently 
recommended.24,26,27,46 Improved education and 
training in this model for assessing and managing 
low back pain are crucial to reducing unnecessary 
investigations and treatment, and improving 
patient outcomes.56
Imaging
Although methods such as magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI), CT and X-ray can be used to image 
the spine, few indications for imaging of low back 
pain are supported by guidelines. The routine use of 
imaging is discouraged unless alerting features are 
present and serious pathology is suspected, or it is 
likely to change management, because findings are 
often poorly correlated with symptoms.34 Incidental 
findings can also lead to unnecessary worry for 
patients, and trigger additional tests and treatment 
that are of little clinical value.40,46,56
To support the appropriate use of imaging in people 
with low back pain, as part of Australia’s Choosing 
Wisely initiative, five peak professional societies and 
clinical colleges recommend that imaging should not 
be performed if there are no indicators of a serious 
underlying cause for low back pain.57
For patients with low back pain who require 
imaging, the choice of method is guided by the 
suspected pathology.34 MRI – delivered in a specialist 
setting – is generally preferred because it has a 
better sensitivity and superior safety profile.24,34,58 
Although CT and X-ray have a limited role, they may 
be used in the presence of alerting features and 
after considering the risks and benefits, if MRI is 
contraindicated or unavailable, or if early referral to 
a specialist is not possible.34,41,44,59Concerns about the possible overuse of imaging of 
the lumbar spine have been expressed for some 
time. The first Australian Atlas of Healthcare Variation  
reported that, in 2013–14, the rate of Medicare 
Benefits Schedule–subsidised services for CT 
imaging of the lumbar spine was 11.8 times higher in 
the area with the highest rate than in the area with 
the lowest rate.14 Although the Atlas data do not 
allow assessment of the appropriateness of imaging 
requests, there is a clear anomaly between the rate 
of CT imaging and the prevalence of serious causes 
for low back pain. As the likelihood of diagnosing 
serious disease is low, the variation suggests 
that some people are receiving imaging that is 
inappropriate and of little or no diagnostic benefit, 
exposing people to unnecessary radiation.55
Education and 
self‑management
Guidelines recommend education that supports 
self-management, and resumption of normal 
activities and exercise.46 Active strategies that 
address psychosocial factors are recommended 
instead of passive approaches such as bed 
rest and pain medicines, which are linked with 
worsening disability.46,56
Educating patients about addressing lifestyle factors 
that may exacerbate symptoms is an important 
part of treatment. Smoking, physical inactivity 
and obesity are each associated with low back 
pain.34 Lifestyle changes can reduce low back pain 
symptoms; for example, a 5% reduction in body 
weight has been shown to reduce the symptoms of 
low back pain.60 
Barriers to evidence-based management include 
misconceptions among both the general public 
and clinicians about the causes and prognosis 
for low back pain, and the effectiveness of 
different treatments.56 Consistent messaging and 
reassurance from all clinicians involved in a patient’s 
care are important to dispel myths and support 
shared decision making. Checking the patient’s 
understanding of the advice and whether they feel 
reassured is essential. 
Low health literacy is a risk factor for poor health 
outcomes.61 Chronic, disabling low back pain 
disproportionately affects people with low income 
and limited education.23 Awareness of how patients’ 
health literacy levels influence their ability to seek, 
understand and apply health information can 
assist clinicians to tailor patient education and 
communication to support self-management.
Low Back Pain Clinical Care Standard 2022  | 11 Pharmacological interventions
Guidelines recommend pharmacological therapy 
as second-line therapy for low back pain after 
self-management and physical or psychological 
strategies to improve function.46 Yet a variety of 
medicines are commonly used for low back pain, 
some of which have little evidence of effectiveness. 
If medicines are needed, NSAIDS are recommended 
as first-line treatment for people at low risk of harm 
from NSAID use.3,47,62 Although opioid analgesics 
relieve severe acute pain, they are high-risk 
medicines that can cause significant harm, including 
death, and are not significantly more effective than 
other commonly used medicines, such as NSAIDs, 
for managing low back pain.63 When an opioid 
analgesic is considered appropriate after careful 
assessment of risks and benefits, immediate-release 
formulations for short-term use are recommended, 
at the lowest effective dose and for the shortest 
duration possible.3,15,24,47,62,64
The Third Australian Atlas of Healthcare Variation  
identified that the rate of opioid analgesics 
dispensed per 100,000 people nationally increased 
by 5% between 2013 and 2017.15 Concerns 
about inappropriate prescribing and misuse of 
opioid medicines have prompted a number of 
national responses in Australia to support harm 
minimisation15, including Australia’s response to 
the World Health Organization Global Patient 
Safety Challenge: Medication without Harm65 and 
development of the Opioid Analgesic Stewardship 
in Acute Pain Clinical Care Standard , supported by 
Australia’s Therapeutic Goods Administration.66Surgery
The first, second and fourth editions of the 
Australian Atlas of Healthcare Variation  identified 
marked differences in hospitalisation rates for 
lumbar spine surgery in people aged 18 years 
and over.14,16,17 Further analysis of the reasons 
for this variation is required; however, potential 
contributing factors suggested in the atlases 
included uncertainty about adherence to guideline 
recommendations for the early management of low 
back pain in primary care, and a lack of access to 
models of care encouraging self-management and a 
multidisciplinary approach. Better use of guidelines, 
including the assessment and management of 
psychosocial factors and optimal use of non-surgical 
treatment options, may prevent deterioration in 
pain and function for patients with low back pain, 
while improving access to care for patients most 
likely to benefit from surgery.21,67 For example, this 
may include spinal decompression for people with 
low back pain and leg pain for whom non-surgical 
treatment has not improved pain or function.24
Implementation
There are several challenges to implementing 
evidence-based recommendations for low back pain 
in clinical practice.68,69 Reported barriers include:
	■Current models of healthcare reimbursement
	■Short consultation times in primary care 
	■Low awareness or uptake of clinical guidelines
	■Physician misconceptions about best care69
	■Fear of litigation if serious pathology is missed 
	■Patient expectations46 
	■Long wait times23
	■Lack of access to, and availability of, support 
services for self-management23
	■Lack of access to, and availability of, specialised 
effective interventions.23
Implementing this clinical care standard and 
integration with other efforts to improve the 
management of low back pain across the health 
sector will be vital to addressing some of these 
issues and achieving better outcomes.

Background: Low back pain 1Quality statement 1 – 
Initial clinical assessment
The assessment of a patient with a new presentation of low back pain 
symptoms, with or without leg pain or other neurological symptoms, 
focuses on screening for specific and/or serious pathology and 
consideration of psychosocial factors. It includes a targeted history 
and physical examination, with a focused neurological examination 
when appropriate. Arrangements are made for follow-up based on an 
evidence -based low back pain pathway.
Purpose
To ensure that a patient’s management is informed by an appropriate history and 
physical examination to screen for serious pathology, and assess pain, physical abilities 
and function.24,40 
What the quality statement means
  ■For patients
If you see a clinician about your low back pain, they will ask:
	■About your pain
	■How it is affecting your daily activities
	■How it is making you feel
	■About your previous health issues and background. 
This will help them to understand your needs and goals for your care.40 Your clinician will 
examine you and check for signs of serious health issues, and may refer you for further 
tests or investigations if necessary. However, even though back pain can feel bad and 
interfere with your life, serious causes are very rare (less than 5% of cases).23 
If a serious underlying problem is unlikely, low back pain can be treated with simple 
measures because the pain will get better on its own over time. It is often not possible or 
necessary to identify an exact cause for low back pain, and it can still be treated even if the 
cause is not known.34 If you have leg pain, this can be nerve-related pain – commonly called 
‘radicular pain’, ‘sciatica’ or ‘referred’ pain – which starts somewhere in your back but is felt 
in your legs.11 For most people, this is managed the same way as low back pain. 
You and your clinician should discuss what follow-up you may need. You may need further 
visits to check on your symptoms and wellbeing, and to adjust your treatment if necessary. 
See your clinician urgently if new symptoms appear, such as problems with controlling 
urine or bowel movements, or numbness or weakness in your legs, back or genitals.
Low Back Pain Clinical Care Standard 2022  | 13
   ■For clinicians
Early assessment should include a targeted history of symptoms, including attention to 
the pain, past history, functional capacity and alerting features for specific and/or serious 
pathology (see  Table 1 ).9 Consider differential diagnoses – for example, nephritis, colitis, hip 
osteoarthritis and aortic dissection.
Physical examination should include a postural assessment, bony and soft tissue palpation 
for tenderness and tone, and movement assessment for range and associated pain. 
A physical examination supports diagnosis and can help to build the patient’s confidence in 
the therapeutic relationship.9,22,28,29,31 
Consider using an evidence-based low back pain pathway that guides the appropriate 
assessment of patients who present with low back pain symptoms. The pathway should 
incorporate screening for specific and/or serious pathology. It should allow the use 
of validated tools, such as the Brief Pain Inventory (short form)70 or the Clinically 
Organized Relevant Exam (CORE) Back Tool71, to aid assessment and monitoring of the 
patient’s progress.40 It should also allow referral to specialist clinicians, when needed, 
for management.
For acute leg pain without severe or progressive motor weakness, initial management 
should be the same as for acute low back pain.9,34 
For patients with low back pain symptoms and/or leg symptoms where there is clinical 
suspicion of neurological impairment, include a focused neurological examination with 
straight leg raise, deep tendon reflexes, and strength and sensation testing.72 
Arrange appropriate investigation or intervention if alerting features of specific and/or 
serious underlying pathology are identified. The presence of multiple alerting features is 
associated with a greater likelihood of serious pathology compared with the presence of 
a single alerting feature.34 Emergency assessment or referral is indicated for clinical signs 
of spinal nerve root compression or spinal cord compression with rapidly progressive 
neurological signs or symptoms33, suspected spinal infection or cauda equina syndrome, 
spinal tumour, trauma or fracture. *,9 
Determine the most likely diagnosis †,11,72, document the assessment findings and 
communicate them to the patient. Arrange follow-up for monitoring or further 
assessment. Reassess at subsequent visits to check for symptom progression or any new 
concerning features that need urgent investigation or specialist assessment (refer to 
Quality statement 8 –  Review and referral ).35,40 
*  See Queensland Health Spine (Orthopaedics)  for a list of common traumatic spine injuries that require 
urgent referral to emergency and should not be referred for elective/fracture clinic categorisation.33
† Likely diagnoses include11,72:
	■Serious spinal disease (less than 1% of cases in primary care)
	■Radicular pain or neurogenic claudication (5–10% of cases in primary care)
	■Non-specific low back pain (90–95% of cases in primary care).

■For healthcare services
Ensure the use of an evidence-based low back pain pathway that guides appropriate assessment, investigation, referral, management and counselling of patients who present with low back pain symptoms, based on their history and physical examination. The pathway should incorporate screening for specific and/or serious pathology, allow the use of validated tools to aid assessment early in an episode of low back pain and monitoring at subsequent visits
40, and allow referral to specialists if needed – for example:
■Brief Pain Inventory (short form)70
■Clinically Organized Relevant Exam (CORE) Back Tool .71
Ensure that clinicians have current training in the clinical assessment of back pain and, when relevant, in the use of validated tools.

tipsFor a patient with low back pain
Explain to the patient that low back pain can be effectively managed even when the cause is not known – for example:
‘We’ve done a good assessment here today and there is no indication that your back pain is associated with a serious underlying condition. While the pain can be severe the good news is that most acute episodes of low back pain settle within a couple of weeks. In the meantime, there are a lot of things you can do to help reduce and manage your low back pain.’
For a patient with low back pain with leg pain 
Explain how low back pain and leg pain may be related and what can be done – for example:
‘The pain going down your leg suggests the pain may be coming from a nerve in your spine. This is called radicular pain or sciatica. Radicular pain is thought to involve irritation or compression of one or more nerves in your spine. This can get better over time.’

Quality statement 1 2Quality statement 2 – 
Psychosocial assessment
Early in each new presentation, a patient with low back pain, with or 
without leg pain or other neurological symptoms, is screened and assessed 
for psychosocial factors that may affect their recovery. This includes 
assessing their understanding of, and concerns about, diagnosis and 
pain, and the impact of pain on their life. The assessment is repeated at 
subsequent visits to measure progress.
Purpose
To identify a patient’s risk of impaired functional outcome related to psychosocial factors, 
and determine the complexity of support they may need to self-manage76 their condition 
and prevent progression to chronic pain.9,22 
What the quality statement means
  ■For patients
It can be harder to recover from back pain if there are other issues that are influencing your 
experience of pain. These might include:
	■Your general mood
	■Your understanding about what is causing your pain and what you can do about it
	■Other factors in your life such as financial, family or work issues that may be causing 
you distress40 
	■The impact the pain is having on your life (such as sleep).
Your clinician may ask you about such issues to understand how they relate to your pain.40 
They may use questionnaires to help understand how your pain is affecting your life, and 
to help identify the best treatment and support for you. For example, you might not be able 
to change factors causing distress, but you can learn ways to reduce their impact on you, 
which can also help with your pain. This is why it is important to identify and understand 
what is influencing your pain and what can be done to help with your recovery.
Low Back Pain Clinical Care Standard 2022  | 19
   ■For clinicians
Certain psychosocial factors and emotional responses to pain are associated with delayed 
recovery9,22,24,28,29, and their presence indicates the need for further assessment and 
appropriate intervention (see Box 1 ).34 Use a biopsychosocial approach that considers the 
relationship between the patient’s beliefs and pain behaviours to manage the patient.9 
Consider using risk assessment tools early in each new episode (first or second visit) of low 
back pain (see the clinician practice points). These tools can help to identify a patient‘s risk 
of poor functional outcome or long-term pain and disability, and reduce the time involved 
in assessment and investigation.9,24,28,77 Examples include:
	■STarT Back Screening Tool78
	■Örebro Musculoskeletal Pain Screening Questionnaire (10-item version).79-81
Repeat risk assessment at subsequent visits to measure progress. 
Listen to the patient, and validate that their thoughts and feelings are understandable, and 
the pain they are experiencing is real.77 Explore the patient’s reasons for presenting and 
perception of their pain, and identify harmful misconceptions, including fear-avoidance 
behaviour.34,35 Motivational interviewing techniques can help to explore and dispel 
misconceptions in a non-threatening way.76
Box 1: Psychosocial factors associated with delayed recovery
Factors associated with delayed recovery from low back pain include:
	■Belief that pain and activity are harmful 
	■‘Sickness behaviours’ (such as extended rest) 
	■Low or negative moods, or social withdrawal 
	■Mental health comorbidities or trauma history
	■Treatment that does not fit with best practice, but remains the focus of the 
patient’s requests 
	■Problems with the compensation system 
	■Previous history of back pain, time off work or other claims 
	■Problems at work or poor job satisfaction 
	■Financial hardship
	■Overprotective family or lack of social support.

Provide clinicians with training and skills to support them in managing patients with low 
back pain, including biopsychosocial pain management. 
Provide access to assessment tools that include screening for psychosocial barriers to 
recovery in patients with low back pain, such as the STarT Back Screening Tool, or the short

practice  
pointsAssessment tools such as the STarT Back and Örebro 
questionnaires help to identify psychosocial risks for poor 
clinical outcomes. If there is insufficient time during the 
consultation to do this:
	■Advise the patient that pain affects both the body and 
the mind, and that some simple questionnaires can help 
identify their concerns and aid their treatment provider in 
developing the best treatment and support for them. 
	■Provide them with an assessment tool and ask them 
to complete it and bring it for further discussion at the 
next consultation
	■Direct them to websites such as MyBackPain75 or 
PainHealth81 to complete the risk assessment online and 
receive tailored information to support self-management, 
and to inform discussion at a subsequent consultation.
The same information may be gained by direct questioning 
when taking a patient history. Some simple questions you can 
use to identify psychosocial issues include the following40: 
	■Do you think your pain will improve or become worse?
 −What to listen for : A belief that the back pain is damaging 
or potentially severely disabling
	■Do you think you would benefit from activity, movement 
or exercise?
 −What to listen for : Fear and avoidance of activity or 
movement-related pain
	■How are you coping emotionally with your back pain?
 −What to listen for : Signs of low mood, distress or 
withdrawal from social interaction
	■What treatments or activities do you think will help 
you recover?
 −What to listen for : Expectations of passive treatment, 
rather than expectations that active participation 
will help
	■Are you worried that something has been missed?
 −What to listen for : Concerns that there is serious 
pathology that has been missed.

tipsInform the patient of the effect that pain can have on the 
body and the mind – for example:
‘The experience of pain affects both body and mind, so 
treatments targeted at both factors can reduce pain 
and disability more than medical care alone.56 Back pain 
does not usually mean your back is badly damaged. 
It means it is sensitised. The brain acts as an amplifier: 
the more you worry and think about your pain, the 
worse it can get.’

Quality statement 2 3Quality statement 3 – 
Reserve imaging for suspected 
serious pathology
*  Through the Choosing Wisely  initiative, five of Australia’s peak health professional colleges, societies and 
associations recommend that clinicians should not request imaging if there are no indicators of a serious 
cause for low back pain.Expectations of imaging and its limited role in diagnosing low back pain are 
discussed with a patient. Early and appropriate referral for imaging occurs 
when there are signs or symptoms of specific and/or serious pathology. 
The likelihood and significance of incidental findings are reported and 
discussed with the patient. 
Purpose
To manage patient expectations and avoid unnecessary investigations, exposure to 
radiation and unnecessary distress.82 To confirm or rule out a suspected diagnosis for 
patients with alerting features for serious underlying pathology.40 
What the quality statement means 
  ■For patients
In most cases of low back pain, an imaging test such as an X-ray, a CT (computed 
tomography) scan or MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) is not necessary. These tests are 
usually only needed when your clinician needs to rule out a serious cause for your back 
pain. It is important to remember that more than 95% of low back pain cases do not have 
serious underlying causes. 
Your clinician will talk to you about the role of imaging in your situation. Unless there is a 
good reason, it is best to avoid scans because they are unlikely to find the reason for your 
pain or change how it is treated. Scans can often show changes that are normal for your 
age and may not be causing your pain, such as:
	■Disc degeneration
	■Facet joint changes
	■Disc bulges
	■Disc protrusions. 
Changes such as these are also found on the scans of people who do not have low 
back pain. Knowing about these changes may worry you and can lead to further tests, 
consultations or treatments that do not help your back pain. Scans can also be expensive 
and inconvenient, and some can expose you to radiation.
  ■For clinicians
A patient without alerting features for serious underlying pathology may not receive any 
clinical benefit from diagnostic imaging (see Table 1  in Quality statement 1). *,28,40 Explain 
that investigations are rarely helpful or indicated for low back pain. Explain that imaging 
Low Back Pain Clinical Care Standard 2022  | 23
 outside recommendations can create unnecessary concerns and that incidental findings 
with no clinical significance can lead to unnecessary tests (see Table 2 ).
Early imaging is appropriate for a patient with alerting features for specific and/or serious 
underlying pathology (see Table 1 ); consider specialist involvement to obtain guidance 
and appropriate imaging studies.9,28,40,82 MRI is generally preferred because it offers better 
sensitivity and a superior safety profile. However, it is not covered by the Medicare Benefits 
Schedule if requested by a general practitioner, a physiotherapist or a chiropractor.83 CT 
has a limited role but in the presence of alerting features may be considered in some cases, 
such as when MRI is unavailable or contraindicated, or early consultation with a specialist is 
not available.59 Figure 2  outlines appropriate imaging decisions.
Ensure that sufficient detail is included on the radiological referral, such as the provisional 
diagnosis and the clinical question being asked, to ensure appropriate imaging and 
reporting (see Box 2 ), and discuss any risks of radiation exposure with the patient.
Ensure that the patient understands the radiological findings. When no serious pathology 
is found, discuss the report in the context of history, examination and other investigations. 
Patient interpretations of imaging findings can lead to unnecessary distress and fear-
avoidance behaviour.34,35 Advise the patient that findings such as disc degeneration; facet 
joint arthritis; and disc bulges, fissures and protrusions are very common in people without 
pain and are usually a normal feature of ageing (see Table 2 ).76 Epidemiological reporting 
of imaging findings may help patients understand the probability and significance of 
incidental findings.
The need for imaging should be reassessed for patients with changing or worsening 
symptoms.28 Patients with unchanged symptoms should not undergo repeated imaging 
unless a diagnosis that was not considered on previous imaging is being contemplated.15,28

	■Clinical question being addressed – A clear diagnostic question will help 
focus the radiologist’s interpretation of results.85
	■Provisional diagnosis – A provisional diagnosis on the request can help 
guide the protocol for imaging investigation. This will help to determine 
what conditions are being ruled in and ruled out.86
	■Relevant clinical details and family history – Can give clues as to the most 
likely diagnosis and area to focus on.86

  ■For healthcare services
Ensure that policies, processes and pathways are in place for appropriate assessment of 
low back pain, with or without leg pain, that describe indications for imaging patients with 
alerting features for serious underlying pathology and when imaging is not needed.40 
Support clinicians to provide advice about the limited role of imaging and make information 
resources – such as those produced by the Commission  and NPS MedicineWise88 
– available to provide to patients. 
Ensure that systems are in place to monitor the appropriateness of imaging requests for 
low back pain as part of quality improvement processes. Consider use of a template for 
reporting of imaging results that includes epidemiological reporting of common imaging 
findings to help clinicians and patients understand the probability and significance of 
incidental findings.

tipsFor a patient with acute low back pain
Explain to the patient why imaging is not recommended – 
for example:
‘Imaging is used mainly to rule out anything serious, but 
otherwise it is not very good for identifying the cause of 
your pain. From what I can see, I’m not concerned that 
you have any of the serious causes of low back pain, so 
there is no need for any scans at this stage. In fact, imaging 
shows up changes that occur normally with age, even in 
people without back pain, so the findings are often not 
very helpful.’ 
For a patient with new‑onset low back pain 
with radicular pain 
Explain to the patient why imaging is not recommended – 
for example:
‘Because a lot of people with radicular pain improve 
rapidly, there is no need for us to do a scan right now. 
If we need to, we can reconsider this at our next review. 
We would only use imaging if your pain continues or gets 
worse, or if there are signs of pressure on the nerves 
in your back that might indicate the need for further 
investigation and referral.’

Low Back Pain Clinical Care Standard 2022  | 27 4Quality statement 4 – 
Patient education and advice
A patient with low back pain is provided with information about their 
condition and receives targeted advice to increase their understanding, 
and address their concerns and expectations. The potential benefits, 
risks and costs of medicines and other treatment options are discussed, 
and the patient is supported to ask questions and share in decisions about 
their care.
Purpose
To educate patients about the nature of low back pain, provide reassurance that they 
do not have a serious disease and reinforce helpful beliefs about pain to achieve 
meaningful goals.11 
To ensure that patients have the opportunity to participate in shared decision making, 
based on an informed understanding of each treatment option, and its potential benefits, 
risks and costs.
What the quality statement means
  ■For patients
One of the best ways to manage low back pain is to learn about the condition, what to 
expect and how to manage it.40,75 Ask questions to make sure you receive the care that is 
right for you (see Box 3  for examples of the types of questions you could ask). Your clinician 
will offer you information and help you understand more about back pain.40 They may 
provide you with fact sheets and direct you to useful resources. Information will be 
provided in a format and language you can understand. 
There are many different treatments for low back pain. In most cases, simple, cost-effective 
measures will give you the most benefit. Your clinician will help you to consider the best 
treatment for your back pain, considering the evidence, and the potential benefits, risks 
and costs, so that you can share in decisions about your care.9,22,24,28 
28 | Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care
 Box 3: Five questions to ask your doctor or other healthcare 
provider before you get any test, treatment or procedure
1. Do I really need this test, treatment or procedure?
Tests may help you and your doctor or other healthcare provider determine the 
cause of the problem. Treatments, such as medicines, and procedures may help 
to treat it.
2. What are the risks?
Will there be side effects of the test or treatment? What are the chances of 
getting results that aren’t accurate? Could that lead to more testing, additional 
treatments or another procedure?
3. Are there simpler, safer options?
Are there alternative options to treatment that could work? Lifestyle changes, 
such as eating healthier foods or exercising more, can be safe and 
effective options.
4. What happens if I don’t do anything?
Ask if your condition might get worse – or better – if you don’t have the test, 
treatment or procedure right away.
5. What are the costs?
Costs can be financial, emotional or a cost of your time. Where there is a cost to 
the community, is the cost reasonable or is there a cheaper alternative?

  ■For clinicians
Recognise and validate the patient’s experience of pain. Reassure patients about the benign 
nature of low back pain, the low risk of serious underlying disease and the likelihood 
of recurrence.24,26,40 Provide educational materials that are consistent with your verbal 
advice to reinforce key messages29,34,35, taking into consideration the patient’s culture and 
health literacy. Address any unhelpful beliefs and thoughts identified in the psychosocial 
assessment that may affect how the patient manages their symptoms, including anxiety or 
fear about their condition.28,34,35,40 Use motivational interviewing techniques to help explore 
and dispel misconceptions in a non-threatening way.76 Check for understanding and 
whether the patient feels reassured. Repeat education at subsequent visits.40
Discuss the patient’s expectations about management of their condition, and address any 
misconceptions about tests and interventions. Explain the evidence for treatment options, 
so the patient can understand why some strategies are, or are not, being recommended.35 
Inform patients about the potential benefits, risks and costs of any treatment 
being considered.22 
  ■For healthcare services
Ensure that clinicians have the knowledge, information and relevant training to provide 
information about the nature of low back pain and to support shared decision making. 
Ensure that patient educational materials are available – including on the potential benefits, 
risks and costs of treatment options – to support the patient to be engaged in their care 
and to participate in decision-making.

Clinician 
practice  
pointsProviding education, reassurance and information about 
back pain is critical to ensuring appropriate care and patient 
self-management. This is particularly so for patients with 
psychosocial factors that may delay recovery. 
In addition to verbal discussion, direct the patient to websites 
such as MyBackPain75 or PainHealth81 and reinforce that the 
first step to feeling better is to understand back pain, what 
the patient can do, and when and where to seek more help.
Nurses and allied health providers in any setting can educate 
patients, and assist with developing and monitoring individual 
management plans and management goals.35
Clinician 
communication 
tipsReassure the patient about the nature of low back pain – for 
example:
‘Most acute low back pain does not indicate serious disease 
or long-term disability.’9 
‘Most people with acute low back pain will feel much better 
or will have recovered within two weeks.’ 
‘Because it recovers so well on its own, a lot of the 
treatments out there don’t help.’11 
‘It’s important to understand what you can do to help 
manage your pain.’
‘It is common for back pain to return. Let’s talk about what 
you can do to help prevent that.’
‘If you do get another episode of back pain, it is likely that it 
will follow a similar course and settle quickly.’25 
Although the aim of providing this advice is to reassure the 
patient, it is important to check whether the patient accepts 
the advice and feels reassured, particularly for patients from 
low socioeconomic backgrounds, who speak English as a 
second language, who have low health literacy or who are 
in distress.

Quality statement 4 5Quality statement 5 – 
Encourage self-management 
and physical activity
A patient with low back pain is encouraged to stay active and continue, or 
return to, usual activity, including work, as soon as possible or feasible. 
Self-management strategies are discussed. The patient and clinician 
develop a plan together that includes practical advice to maximise function, 
and limit the impact of pain and other symptoms on daily life. The plan 
addresses individual needs and preferences.
Purpose
To involve patients in the management of their pain, and encourage self-confidence to stay 
active, avoid bed rest and continue or quickly return to usual activities, including work.46,82 
What the quality statement means
  ■For patients
Do not wait for all the pain to be gone before you start moving.90 Staying active and 
continuing daily activities as normally as possible (including work) leads to the most rapid 
and complete recovery.11 Your clinician will encourage you to stay active and continue or 
quickly get back to normal activities, including exercise and work, wherever possible.91 
If your pain is worse after activity and persists, you may be advised to take things a little 
easier at first and gradually build up over a few days or weeks.90 Avoid long periods of bed 
rest, which can slow down recovery.34,91 Try to remain at work, or get back to work as soon 
as possible. 
Your clinician will suggest ways for you to manage your pain and can develop a 
self-management plan with you, so you know what to do. Things that you do yourself  to 
control your pain (like pacing yourself when carrying out physical activity) are more likely 
to help than treatments that are done to you (like medicines, massage or surgery). Refer to 
the patient information sheet How to manage your back pain  for things that you can do.
You will be encouraged to set treatment goals.91 Your clinician can also discuss monitoring 
your symptoms; pacing (or spreading out) activity into small, regular periods40; relaxation 
techniques; and exercise routines and activities.82 If activities or treatments in your 
self-management plan make your pain worse, talk to your clinician about other strategies 
you can try.
Continue with physical activity even after your back pain has improved, because this is 
important for preventing future episodes.40 
Low Back Pain Clinical Care Standard 2022  | 31
   ■For clinicians
Explain the importance of maintaining or quickly returning to normal activities, 
including physical activity and a graded return to work * and/or other meaningful activity 
(see  Box 4 ).9,24-26,29,34 Listen to the patient, and validate that their thoughts and feelings 
are understandable, and the pain they are experiencing is real (see Quality statement 2 
– Psychosocial assessment ).77 Discuss strategies to support the patient to continue 
to engage or quickly re-engage socially. Prolonged bed rest is harmful and should 
be discouraged.34 
Consider the impact of lifestyle factors that are associated with occurrence of low back pain 
episodes, such as smoking and obesity.34
Encourage patients to take control of their condition by following advice about ways to self-
manage their back pain symptoms.14 Assess the patient’s confidence and ability to engage 
in self-management, particularly for patients with a history of recurrent back pain and 
identified psychosocial risk factors. Where potential barriers appear to exist for the patient 
to undertake self-management and active strategies, discuss strategies to overcome them. 
Self-management will differ for each patient depending on their history, pain severity and 
confidence to undertake self-management. A self-management plan may vary from brief 
advice to a more detailed management plan, according to the needs of the patient, and 
may include:
	■Prioritising active management strategies (such as physical activity, social connection, 
healthy sleep habits and use of heat) over passive strategies (such as pain medicines, 
activity avoidance and massage)28,35 
	■Gradually increasing activity levels by using pacing to prevent overexertion followed 
by inactivity †,35
	■Supporting the patient to set SMART (specific, measurable, achievable, realistic and 
time-bound) goals that are important to them.35 
If physical activity causes the patient’s symptoms to spread (pain or other symptoms 
radiating to the leg), activity limitation but not cessation may be required.29,40

Quality statement 5 Box 4: Advice to stay active for people with acute low 
back pain
Indication
Staying active, instead of resting in bed, is recommended for a low back pain 
episode. It can improve pain relief and the ability to perform everyday activities 
(functional state), reduce sick leave and enable people to continue or return 
to work.
Precautions
Patients can be advised to reduce, alter or modify certain painful activities 
(for example, lifting) for a few days, as certain activities may exacerbate back pain. 
Patients need to be reassured that an exacerbation of pain is not an indication of 
damage, and fluctuations in pain can be expected during recovery from acute low 
back pain. Patients should feel confident to continue or get back to their normal 
everyday activities in days to weeks.
Description
Staying active means continuing with normal daily activities as much as possible, 
including going to work. It also means trying to reduce long periods of inactivity. 
No specific exercise(s) is needed at this stage.
People with low back pain who remain active, even when in pain, do better in the 
long term. In fact, it appears that the longer a person stays in bed because of low 
back pain, the worse their ability to work or return to work becomes.
Tips and challenges
Patients should be advised that it is important not to wait for all pain to be gone 
before they start moving. Having a strategy whereby they either reduce or alter 
certain painful activities (for example, lifting) for a few days, and then gradually 
build up these activities again can be recommended.
Patients often fear that pain is a sign of deterioration and/or further damage. 
They are often anxious about returning to physical work or activities that are high 
impact or involve bending, twisting or lifting. Patients may need to be reassured 
that the back is strong and, although they may need to reduce, alter or modify how 
they do these activities, they can still do them. They may also need reassurance 
that the pain is likely to subside and that ongoing pain is not an indication of 
further damage.

recurrent low back pain by continuing physical activity and 
participating in regular exercise.29,40
Clinician 
communication 
tipsThere is often confusion about what ‘staying active’ means. 
It means different things to different patients. Staying active 
does not mean undertaking any particular activity, and does 
not mean resting.90 
Explain to the patient why staying active is important – 
for example:
‘The pain does not mean you are undergoing serious 
damage. Remember that your back is strong. Movements 
may be painful at first, like an ankle sprain, but they will 
get better as you gradually get active again. It is likely that 
you will experience some pain with activity, but that does 
not mean that your back is getting worse or that your spine 
is damaged.’34 
Advise the patient on the importance of continuing or 
returning to work – for example: 
‘Staying at or getting back to work as you are able, even 
part-time at first, will also help you recover. By working 
together with your employer and healthcare team, you are 
more likely to recover and avoid the problems associated 
with taking a lot of time off work.’

Quality statement 5 6Quality statement 6 – 
Physical and/or 
psychological interventions
A patient with low back pain is offered physical and/or psychological 
interventions based on their clinical and psychosocial assessment findings. 
Therapy is targeted at overcoming identified barriers to recovery.
Purpose
To help reduce pain; prevent chronic pain; restore and maintain physical activity and 
function; minimise disability, stress or anxiety; address psychosocial factors that contribute 
to pain; and reduce the need for medicines or surgery.34,35,40 
What the quality statement means
  ■For patients
Your clinician will offer information and support based on your individual needs, values 
and preferences, and discuss your goals for improved function and mobility.40 For many 
people with new back pain, additional therapies are not necessary because the pain will 
improve naturally as you follow the advice of your clinician about physical activity and 
self-management. To avoid ongoing issues, treatments that target both the mind and the 
body will be considered because they are more likely to help with reducing your pain and 
improving your function long term.56 
You may be referred to other clinicians for physical therapy, psychological pain 
management support or a combined treatment approach. Although hands-on therapies 
may be offered, the overall goal should be to support you to manage your symptoms 
independently in the longer term. There are many types of clinicians who can help you to 
set achievable movement and exercise goals, and show you how to pace your activities. 
For some people with repeated episodes, a psychologist or counsellor can also help you 
to understand your pain and how it affects your body, thoughts and behaviours, and 
help you to develop effective coping strategies. Your general practitioner may be able to 
advise about options for receiving Medicare rebates for these services, if you meet the 
criteria. You should always receive strategies that support you to manage your symptoms 
independently in the longer term.
  ■For clinicians
Use the findings from the psychosocial assessment (see Quality statement 2 –  
Psychosocial assessment ) to determine the complexity and intensity of support the patient 
may need.24 
For patients with few psychosocial risk factors, who are likely to improve quickly, consider 
simpler and less intensive support such as reassurance, guidance on self-management 
and advice to keep active (see Box 4  in Quality statement 5).24 Offer a review at one to two 
weeks to assess recovery and the need for further physical or psychological interventions.47 
Low Back Pain Clinical Care Standard 2022  | 35
 For patients at higher risk of a poor outcome, consider early referral for physical and/
or psychological therapies.9,24,35 A patient with moderate to high levels of distress who 
has difficulty overcoming fear of movement or changing their beliefs or behaviours may 
require more specific psychological interventions, such as cognitive behavioural therapy, 
progressive relaxation or mindfulness-based stress reduction.11,24,26,27,35,46 A cognitive 
behavioural approach can help the patient to develop adaptive coping strategies to 
self-manage their pain.9 Where possible, refer patients to a clinician who has experience 
in pain management and understands the biopsychosocial factors that influence it.35 
Assess and resolve any concerns the patient may have about such a referral.25 
For patients with an acute exacerbation of persistent or chronic low back pain, advise 
that physical activity and exercise therapy can help to relieve pain and improve function 
(see Box 5 ), and check adherence to, and effectiveness of, any previous physical and 
psychological treatments.9,23,25,26,29,34,35,90
Since the evidence does not show that one form of exercise is superior, exercise should be 
individualised to the patient’s activity preferences, beliefs and functional impairment. *,34 
The effects of treatment should be documented, with attention to objective and functional 
improvements.92 Advise the patient they may be eligible for Medicare rebates as part of a 
GP Management Plan and Team Care Arrangements.93 
Physical therapies (such as heat wraps and massage)26 may also help to improve function 
and mobility26,28,30, but only as part of a treatment package including physical activity, with 
or without psychological therapy, and only for a short period of time.23,24,40 
Box 5: Practice points for recommending exercise for patients
	■Exercise programs should be individualised, taking into account 
the patient’s physical activity preferences, beliefs and specific 
functional impairments
	■Exercise programs should include stretching, strengthening and aerobic 
exercises that are functionally oriented
	■Starting with gentle movements is the first step. These might include water-
based walking, land-based walking, gentle swimming and floor stretches 
that encourage the spine to move in its normal planes. Activity should 
be graded by the duration of time spent exercising, rather than the 
pain experienced
	■As the patient’s tolerance to activity over longer periods increases, 
the mode, frequency and/or intensity of activity can be progressed
	■Functional exercises can be introduced to encourage activation of large 
muscle groups (for example, squats, lunges, step-ups)
	■Exercise that patients enjoy (for example, yoga, Pilates, walking, cycling) can 
be gradually introduced (for example, start at 15–20 minutes duration and 
then increase)
	■In the later stages of rehabilitation, more dynamic and higher-load exercises 
can be performed.

pointsPsychological techniques are an important component of 
acute and chronic pain management. For patients with 
acute low back pain, brief assessment may be adequate. 
Psychological intervention can assist with treatment 
adherence and reduced analgesic use.35 For patients 
with chronic low back pain, a comprehensive assessment 
of psychosocial impact and contributors is required. 
Psychological intervention is a first-line management 
strategy that may improve function, quality of life, treatment 
adherence and mood.35 
There are a range of physical and psychological therapies, 
but not all are effective or relevant for low back pain. 
For example, electrotherapies such as ultrasound and laser 
are often not effective. If your patient has not responded 
to a therapy, clarify what treatment they received and what 
it entailed.
Low Back Pain Clinical Care Standard 2022  | 37 Clinician 
communication 
tipsSensitive and motivational communication builds health 
literacy about low back pain and empowers patients to 
take an active role in their care, rather than relying on 
passive treatments.
Explain that experience of pain affects both body and mind, 
and so treatments targeted at both factors can reduce pain 
and disability more than medical care alone.56 
When referring a patient for psychological intervention, 
emphasise that the use of psychological techniques does 
not mean that they have a suspected psychological illness, 
or that their pain is not real or not being taken seriously. 
Instead, describe pain as a complex problem that requires a 
multidimensional approach. This is particularly important for 
patients with chronic pain.35

Quality statement 6 7Quality statement 7 – 
Judicious use of pain medicines 
A patient is advised that the goal of pain medicines is to enable physical 
activity, not to eliminate pain. If a medicine is prescribed, it is in accordance 
with the current Therapeutic Guidelines , with ongoing review of benefit and 
clear stopping goals. Anticonvulsants, benzodiazepines and antidepressants 
are avoided, because their risks often outweigh potential benefits, and 
there is evidence of limited effectiveness. Opioid analgesics are considered 
only in carefully selected patients, at the lowest dose for the shortest 
duration possible.
Purpose
To ensure that medicines are used effectively and safely for patients with low back pain to 
avoid unnecessary side effects and the risk of dependence.24,82 
What the quality statement means
  ■For patients
The aim of taking medicines is to reduce pain enough to help you stay active, rather than to 
completely stop the pain. Medicines are only one part of pain management. They are most 
effective in the short term to help get you moving and support you while you learn active 
self-management strategies. It is important to remain physically active and continue with 
physical activity and self-management strategies after you start any medicine.40 
When suggesting a medicine, your clinician will consider your symptoms, any other 
conditions you may have, other medicines you take and your treatment preferences. 
They will explain:
	■What the medicine is for
	■How much to take
	■How long to take it for
	■The expected benefits and risks, including possible side effects. 
Ask questions to decide if the medicines being suggested are right for you, and to make 
sure you understand how to use them.
Medicines that are generally not recommended for low back pain include benzodiazepines 
(sometimes prescribed as muscle relaxants), anticonvulsants (also used to treat epilepsy) 
and antidepressants. This is because these medicines are not very effective for low back 
pain and can have significant side effects.82 
Opioid analgesics should only be used short term at the lowest dose that helps your 
symptoms and as recommended by your clinician. Do not use these for long periods 
because they can cause significant side effects and can be addictive.35
Low Back Pain Clinical Care Standard 2022  | 39
   ■For clinicians
Explain that the goal of pain medicines is to reduce pain to support continuation of 
usual activities, including physical activity and work, rather than to eliminate pain.34 
Offer information on how pain medicines may be combined with physical activity and 
self-management strategies to help the patient improve their function and mobility.40 
If a pain medicine is being considered:
	■Discuss the patient’s individual expectations, preferences, comorbidities, needs and 
treatment goals40,53 
	■Review the patient’s current medicines, including use of over-the-counter medicines, and 
previously prescribed medicines used to manage pain
	■Provide information about the risks and benefits associated with specific pain 
medicines40, including the potential for dependency and how to manage side effects35,53 
	■Prescribe the lowest effective dose for the shortest possible time in line with current 
Therapeutic Guidelines *,34,35
	■Establish and document clear stopping goals34,35 
	■Encourage the patient to continue other self-management strategies after they start 
the medicine40 
	■Review early and frequently to assess and monitor the effectiveness of the treatment, 
adverse effects, misuse and functional gains.
Evidence has shown that anticonvulsants (pregabalin and gabapentin), tricyclic 
antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and benzodiazepines have no or 
limited effectiveness in reducing low back pain or disability, and have significant risks.94,95
Opioid analgesics have limited evidence of short-term effectiveness. In addition to 
side effects such as constipation and somnolence, they carry the risk of overdose and 
dependency, and can prolong the time to recovery.82,94,96 If opioid analgesics are used for 
severe acute pain – for example, in patients who present to the emergency department – 
prescribe immediate-release formulations on a limited trial basis for a defined duration, 
as part of an overall pain management strategy that takes into account the patient’s 
opioid status. †,34 Before prescribing an opioid analgesic, it is essential that the patient and 
anyone involved in their care understand how to use these medicines safely35, including 
their correct storage and disposal (see Opioid Analgesic Stewardship in Acute Pain Clinical 
Care Standard ).66

Quality statement 7   ■For healthcare services
Ensure that systems, processes and resources are in place to support clinicians to 
provide information to patients about their treatment. Ensure that patients have 
access to medicines advice, including information on the risks and benefits of pain 
medicines.40 Provide clinicians with access to current Therapeutic Guidelines  and monitor 
appropriate adherence. 
Policies should limit prescribing of opioid analgesics for low back pain to immediate-release 
formulations for a limited duration. Ensure that information is provided to manage patient 
expectations about ongoing opioid analgesic treatment. In the emergency department 
setting, durations of therapy should be explained to the patient. This information should 
also be included in the discharge summary, along with a description of the advice and the 
limited dose and quantity given to the patient, with the goal of avoiding prolonged use, 
in accordance with the Opioid Analgesic Stewardship in Acute Pain Clinical Care Standard , 
(see Quality statement 9 – Transfer of care).

practice  
pointsEnsure that first-line management strategies such as patient 
education and supported self-management have been 
implemented before considering pain medicines.34 
Take a medication history that includes over-the-counter 
medicines. Ask the patient if any medicines being used are 
helping their pain. If the medicines are helping, check if the 
patient is taking them appropriately or experiencing any side 
effects (such as stomach pain associated with non-steroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs), and for contraindications. 
If the patient has used a prescription pain medicine 
previously, ask about their response to the medicine 
and whether they experienced breakthrough pain. This 
information can be used to determine a starting dose, or 
prevent the use of previously unhelpful therapy.34,35

tipsFor patients with acute low back pain
Advise the patient on immediate and follow-up actions – 
for example:
‘For now, I suggest you stay as active as you can and 
try things like heat wraps to help with the pain. We can 
reassess whether you need medicines to help manage 
your pain at our next review. How do you feel about 
that approach?’
For a patient with new‑onset low back pain 
with leg pain (without neurological signs) 
Advise the patient on your recommendations and approach 
– for example:
‘I recommend you try some gentle exercise to keep 
you from stiffening up, and we will monitor your 
progress closely.’
‘If we need to, we could try a short course of 
anti-inflammatory medicines (like ibuprofen) afterwards. 
This may help a little bit with low back pain, but has not 
been tested for leg pain. These medicines also have 
potential side effects and may not be suitable for everyone.’ 
‘Most of the medicines used for managing low back pain 
(including drugs for nerve pain and opioid analgesics) do 
not have strong evidence that they are effective. All of 
these medicines have potential significant side effects, so it 
would be best not to use them routinely. If we need to use 
them, we need to do so very carefully and on a short-term 
trial basis only.’ 
‘If the pain becomes unbearable, we can discuss other 
options. How would you feel about that approach?’
For patients with an acute exacerbation of 
persistent low back pain
Inform the patient of the latest research on non-drug options 
for low back pain – for example:
‘Nowadays, non-drug options are preferred over pain 
medicines to manage persistent low back pain. Non-drug 
options like exercise programs and psychological 
approaches are effective for managing pain, and have 
fewer risks and side effects. How would you feel if we 
started on one of those approaches? How would you feel 
if we tried to replace some of the medicines you are taking 
with one of those approaches? We can review how it is 
going and discuss your medicine options within the next 
2–4 weeks.’

Quality statement 7 8Quality statement 8 – 
Review and referral 
A patient with persisting or worsening symptoms, signs or function is 
reassessed at an early stage to determine the barriers to improvement. 
Referral for a multidisciplinary approach is considered. Specialist medical or 
surgical review is indicated for severe or progressive back or leg pain that 
is unresponsive to other therapy, progressive neurological deficits, or other 
signs of specific and/or serious pathology.
Purpose
To ensure that review and referral for a patient with persisting or worsening low back pain 
are tailored to the patient’s clinical needs, with the goal of identifying specific and serious 
diagnoses or progression, while preventing chronic pain and related long-term problems.9,34 
What the quality statement means
  ■For patients
Let your clinician know if your pain continues to be a problem, if your symptoms get worse 
or if new symptoms appear. Your clinician can monitor your symptoms and wellbeing, 
and adjust your treatment if needed. You may be referred to another clinician or team of 
clinicians who can help you with your goals for achieving physical activity and mobility, and 
help you to understand your pain and how to reduce its impact on your body, mental state 
and behaviours.
In some instances, your clinician may refer you to a specialist spine service, a pain service 
or a physician (such as a rheumatologist, a spine surgeon, or a pain or rehabilitation 
physician). These specialists can assess your condition, provide advice and discuss other 
specialised treatment options. 
Your clinician will also refer you to a spine surgeon if they suspect a serious condition for 
which surgery is appropriate, or if you have any nerve compression that is getting worse. 
  ■For clinicians
If the patient’s pain is persisting or worsening on review, assess if the lack of improvement 
relates to progression of their condition, or physical, functional or psychosocial factors.34 
Review the initial assessment and current management program, including psychosocial 
factors that may delay recovery, medicines and adherence to self-management strategies, 
and adjust the treatment plan accordingly. Any treatments trialled should be assessed for 
efficacy, and ineffective treatments should be discontinued rather than accumulated.26 
Discuss ongoing compensation or legal actions that may affect a patient’s response to 
treatment, because there is an association between compensation-related factors and 
poorer physical and psychological function.98 
For a patient with disabling low back or leg pain, or significantly limited function on review 
at 2–6 weeks29, consider referral to a healthcare provider with expertise in using evidence-
based approaches to support functional improvement9,29,34,72 (see Quality statement 6 –  
Physical and/or psychological interventions ). 
Low Back Pain Clinical Care Standard 2022  | 43
 A multidisciplinary team approach should be used to address both physical and 
psychosocial barriers to recovery when required. This should include a mechanism for 
regular shared communication between healthcare providers and ensuring that consistent 
information is provided to a patient receiving care from multiple clinicians.9,29,34 
Referral to a multidisciplinary chronic pain management program or clinician with 
appropriate expertise should be considered for patients with recurrent or persistent low 
back pain, or any patient who has not recovered from the acute episode by 12 weeks.9 
These services can provide more intensive treatment to support resumption of pre-back 
pain activities. They have improved function and self-management as the main objectives, 
and allow ongoing regular review of the patient so that care can be modified according to 
the patient’s condition.9,28,34,62,99 
Earlier referral or review may be warranted for patients with an acute exacerbation 
of chronic back pain, or when it is clear that pain is persisting or worsening despite 
appropriate early intervention.9,72 
Any new concerning features (for example, serious pathologies, neurological deficits) 
require urgent investigation or specialist assessment (see Table 1  in Quality statement 1). * 
Patients with severe or progressively deteriorating neurological signs and symptoms should 
be immediately referred for urgent imaging and surgical review (see Box 6  for essential 
history to be included in the referral).34,46 
Box 6: Essential history to include in a referral for urgent 
imaging and surgical review
	■Presence and duration of neurological signs and symptoms
	■Presence or absence of concerning features
	■Age (at onset) under 16 years and over 50 years with new-onset pain
	■Motor deficit (such as foot weakness)
	■Recent significant trauma
	■Unexplained weight loss
	■Previous history of malignancy (however long ago)
	■History of intravenous drug use
	■Previous longstanding steroid use
	■Recent serious illness
	■Recent significant infection
	■Mechanism of injury
	■Functional status
	■Management to date (including previous spinal surgery and non-
operative management)
	■General medical history
	■Relevant imaging results (such as X-ray, CT, MRI).

Quality statement 8   ■For healthcare services
Ensure that systems, processes and resources are in place to support clinicians to 
monitor the symptoms, function and psychosocial wellbeing of patients with low back 
pain. Protocols should describe appropriate referral pathways and support timely access, 
including for patients with persisting and worsening pain with signs of serious pathology.
For services providing one component of multidisciplinary care, ensure that systems are 
in place to facilitate effective shared care across multiple healthcare providers, including 
mechanisms for regular communication among providers to facilitate the delivery of 
consistent information to the patient. 
At a healthcare service level, assess whether multidisciplinary pain clinics and specialised 
spinal surgical services are meeting the needs of their populations. Consider quality 
improvement activities to assess effectiveness and improve access to care.
Indicator for local monitoring
Indicator 8a : Evidence of a locally approved policy that defines the process for 
review and referral of patients with low back pain. The policy should specify the:
	■Indications and timelines for when a patient with low back pain should be 
reassessed to reconsider their diagnosis and treatment plan
	■Referral pathways to appropriate healthcare providers and programs to 
support recovery
	■Mechanisms to facilitate effective communication between healthcare providers 
and the patient 
	■Process to monitor the effectiveness of the recommended treatment(s).

Low Back Pain Clinical Care Standard 2022  | 45 Appendix A: 
General principles of care
This clinical care standard aligns with key 
principles that are the foundation for achieving 
safe, high-quality care. When implementing this 
clinical care standard, healthcare services should 
ensure that quality improvement activities support 
these principles.
Person‑centred care
Person-centred care  is health care that is respectful 
of, and responsive to, the preferences, needs and 
values of patients and consumers.36
Clinical care standards support the key principles of 
person-centred care, namely:
	■Treating patients with dignity and respect
	■Encouraging patient participation in decision-
making (see Shared decision making )
	■Communicating with patients about their clinical 
condition and treatment options
	■Providing patients with information in a format 
that they understand and encouraging them to 
participate in decision-making. 
Shared decision making
Shared decision making involves discussion 
and collaboration between a consumer and 
their clinician. It is about bringing together the 
consumer’s values, goals and preferences with 
the best available evidence about benefits, risks 
and uncertainties of treatment, to reach the most 
appropriate healthcare decisions for that person.Involving support people
The Australian Charter of Healthcare Rights  (second 
edition)100 describes the rights that consumers, or 
someone they care for, can expect when receiving 
health care.
Patients have the right to involve the people they 
want in planning and making decisions about their 
health care and treatment. This could be a family 
member, carer, friend or consumer advocate such 
as a social worker. Many healthcare services employ 
different types of liaison officers, such as Aboriginal 
and Torres Strait Islander liaison officers, who 
can provide patients with advocacy, information 
and support. 
This clinical care standard does not specifically 
refer to carers and family members, but statements 
that refer to clinicians’ discussions with patients 
about their care should be understood to include 
support people if this is what the patient wishes, or 
a substitute decision-maker if the person is unable 
to provide their consent.
Informed consent 
Informed consent is a person’s voluntary and 
informed decision about a healthcare treatment, 
procedure or intervention that is made with 
adequate knowledge and understanding of the 
benefits and risks, and the alternative options 
available. A fact sheet for clinicians on informed 
consent101 is available.
Action 2.04 in the National Safety and Quality 
Health Service (NSQHS) Standards requires health 
service organisations to ensure that informed 
consent processes comply with legislation and 
best practice.36 
46 | Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care
 Cultural safety and 
patient safety
Cultural safety is about overcoming the cultural 
power imbalances of places, people and policies 
to contribute to improvements in Aboriginal and 
Torres Strait Islander health.102 
The Cultural Respect Framework 2016–2026  commits 
the Australian Government and all states and 
territories to embed cultural respect principles in 
their health systems.103 The framework should be 
used to develop, implement and evaluate cultural 
awareness and cultural competency strategies.
Health consumers are safest when clinicians have 
considered power relations, cultural differences 
and patients’ rights. Part of this process requires 
clinicians to review their own beliefs and attitudes.104 The NSQHS Standards User Guide for Aboriginal 
and Torres Strait Islander Health  describes six 
specific actions that aim to help healthcare services 
improve the quality of care and health outcomes for 
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.36,104 
Action 1.09 of the National Safety and Quality 
Primary and Community Healthcare Standards 
outlines that the healthcare service identifies 
patient populations using its service who are at 
greater risk of avoidable differences in health 
outcomes, including:
	■Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people
	■People with disability
	■People from diverse backgrounds.
Low Back Pain Clinical Care Standard 2022  | 47 Appendix B: 
Indicators to support local monitoring
The Commission has developed a set of indicators 
to support clinicians and healthcare services in 
monitoring how well they implement the care 
described in this clinical care standard. The 
indicators are a tool to support local quality 
improvement activities. No benchmarks are set for 
any indicator.
The process to develop the indicators specified in 
this document comprised:
	■A review of existing Australian and 
international indicators
	■Prioritisation, review and refinement of the 
indicators with the topic working group.
Most data underlying these indicators are collected 
from local sources, through prospective data 
collection or retrospective chart audits, or review of 
policies and protocols. In this document, the indicator titles and hyperlinks 
to the specifications are included with the relevant 
quality statement under the heading ‘Indicator(s) for 
local monitoring’. Full specifications for the Low Back 
Pain Clinical Care Standard  indicators can be found 
in the Metadata Online Registry (METEOR): meteor.
aihw.gov.au/content/755790 .
METEOR is Australia’s web-based repository 
for national metadata standards for the health, 
community services and housing assistance sectors. 
Hosted by the Australian Institute of Health and 
Welfare, METEOR provides users with online access 
to a wide range of nationally endorsed data and 
indicator definitions.

 Appendix C: 
Measuring and monitoring 
patient experiences
Systematic, routine monitoring of patients’ 
experiences of, and outcomes from, health care 
is an important way to ensure that the patient’s 
perspective drives service improvements and 
person-centred care. This is the case in all 
healthcare services. 
Patient experience measures
While this clinical care standard does not include 
indicators specific to measuring patient experiences, 
the Commission strongly encourages healthcare 
services to use the Australian Hospital Patient 
Experience Question Set (AHPEQS). AHPEQS is a 
12-question generic patient experience survey that 
has been validated in both day-only and admitted 
hospital patients across many clinical settings. The 
instrument is available for download105 to both 
private and public sector healthcare services.Patient‑reported 
outcome measures
In Australia, patient-reported outcome measures 
(PROMs) are an emerging method of assessing 
the quality of health care. The Commission is 
leading a national work program to support the 
consistent and routine use of PROMs to drive 
quality improvement.
PROMs are standardised, validated questionnaires 
that patients complete, without any input from 
healthcare providers. They are often administered 
at least twice to an individual patient – at baseline 
and again after an intervention, or at regular 
intervals during a chronic illness. The information 
contributed by patients filling out PROMs 
questionnaires can be used to support and monitor 
the movement of health systems towards person-
centred, value-based health care.
PROMs are being used to evaluate healthcare 
effectiveness at different levels of the health system, 
from the individual level to service and system 
levels. There is growing interest across Australia 
and internationally in the routine interrogation 
of patient-reported outcome information for 
evaluation and decision-making activities at levels of 
the health system beyond the clinical consultation.
Low Back Pain Clinical Care Standard 2022  | 49 Appendix D: 
Integration with national safety 
and quality standards
Implementation of this clinical care standard will 
help healthcare services to meet requirements 
of the National Safety and Quality Health Service 
(NSQHS) Standards36, or the National Safety and 
Quality Primary and Community Healthcare 
(Primary and Community Healthcare) Standards, 
whichever is relevant to the service.37 
Both the NSQHS Standards and the Primary and 
Community Healthcare Standards aim to protect the 
public from harm and improve the quality of health 
service provision. They provide a quality assurance 
mechanism that tests whether relevant systems are 
in place to ensure that expected standards of safety 
and quality are met.
Within both the NSQHS Standards and the Primary 
and Community Healthcare Standards, the 
Clinical Governance Standard and the Partnering 
with Consumers Standard set the overarching 
requirements, or clinical governance framework, for 
the effective implementation of other standards.
National Safety and Quality 
Health Service Standards
Relevant actions
Under the Clinical Governance Standard, healthcare 
services are expected to: 
	■Support clinicians to use the best available 
evidence, including clinical care standards 
(Action 1.27b) 
	■Monitor and respond to unwarranted clinical 
variation (Action 1.28).
Implementation of the NSQHS Standards is 
mandated in all hospitals, day procedure services 
and public dental services across Australia. 
Healthcare services are expected to implement the 
NSQHS Standards in a way that is appropriate to the 
clinical services provided and their associated risks. 
Similar implementation strategies apply to multiple 
actions across the NSQHS Standards; identifying the 
links between actions will help healthcare services 
to ensure that their safety and quality systems 
are integrated, and reduce duplication of effort in implementing the eight NSQHS standards and 
clinical care standards.

Relevant actions 
Under the Clinical Governance Standard, healthcare 
services are expected to:
	■Support healthcare providers to use best-practice 
guidelines and available evidence, including 
clinical care standards such as the Low Back 
Pain Clinical Care Standard , where relevant 
(Action 1.20b) 
	■Monitor and respond to unwarranted clinical 
variation (Action 1.21).
Application of the Primary and Community 
Healthcare Standards is voluntary. They should 
only be applied where services are involved in 
the direct care of patients. The way in which an 
individual primary and/or community healthcare 
service implements the Primary and Community 
Healthcare Standards will depend on the size 
of the healthcare service, as well as the risks 
and complexity associated with the services it 
delivers. Further information about the Primary 
and Community Healthcare Standards is available 
on the Primary and Community Health Service 
Standards webpage .37

 Glossary
Term Definition
acute low back pain Lasts less than three months.
The term ‘acute’ indicates the duration of symptoms, and is not 
a diagnosis.9,24,35
biopsychosocial 
(also known as 
sociopsychobiomedical) 
frameworkA framework that helps clinicians understand the complexity of their patient’s 
pain experience, and lays a foundation for assessment and more effective 
pain management. The way a person processes nociceptive signals in their 
brain, and their resulting pain experience, depends on their developmental 
stage (for example, infancy, adolescence, adulthood), the social and cultural 
context (socio-), their emotional state (psycho-) and their biological health 
(-biomedical). A biopsychosocial approach considers the bidirectional 
relationship between these factors and the person’s pain experience to 
determine strengths, and areas that may need support during management.35 
chronic low back pain 
(also referred to as 
persistent pain)Low back pain that is present for more than three months.
The term ‘chronic’ indicates the duration of symptoms, and is not a diagnosis. 
Chronic low back pain may have a specific cause, or may be non-specific – 
that is, no cause has been identified.9,35 
clinician A trained health professional, including registered and non-registered 
practitioners, who provides direct clinical care to patients. Clinicians may 
provide care within a healthcare service as an employee, a contractor or a 
credentialed healthcare provider, or under other working arrangements. They 
include nurses, midwives, medical practitioners, allied health professionals, 
paramedics and other professions who provide health care, and students 
who provide health care under supervision.36
exercise therapy Various forms of physical exercise that are used to prevent or treat low 
back pain. The term ‘exercise therapy’ includes a wide range of different 
exercise types, environments and theoretical models. All types of exercise 
therapy engage the patient with a program of physical exercise that they 
are encouraged to perform regularly. Exercise therapy may be delivered 
by a range of healthcare professionals on a one-to-one basis or in a group 
environment. The focus may vary from exercise using specialist gym 
equipment to exercises conducted at home or in the outdoor environment.26 
mechanical back pain A term sometimes used to describe non-specific low back pain to highlight 
the exclusion of an underlying systemic inflammatory disease (for example, 
axial spondyloarthritis) or other serious pathology (for example, spinal 
infection, malignancy, fracture). It should not be used to infer a reliable 
relationship between symptoms and anatomical structures.9
multidisciplinary 
approachAn approach to chronic pain management that simultaneously addresses 
all biopsychosocial factors affecting the patient’s pain, and helps patients 
achieve their goals sooner compared with approaches that address only 
some contributors to the patient’s pain.35
Low Back Pain Clinical Care Standard 2022  | 51 Term Definition
neuropathic pain A type of pain that occurs following damage to the nervous system itself. 
The sensations associated with this type of pain are described as burning 
or shooting pains. The skin can be numb, tingling or extremely sensitive.106 
Neuropathic pain may be peripheral (peripheral nerve) or central (spinal cord 
or brain), depending on the location of the damage in the nervous system.35
nociceptive pain Pain caused by damage to body tissue and usually described as 
a sharp, aching or throbbing pain. It can be caused by a range of 
conditions or factors, including injury, surgery, arthritis, osteoporosis or 
musculoskeletal conditions.106 
opioids Medicines used to achieve analgesia by reducing transmission of nociceptive 
impulses (through effects at central nervous system mu-opioid receptors) 
and modulating the descending inhibitory pathways from the brain. 
Some opioids (for example, tramadol, tapentadol) also produce analgesia via 
non-opioid receptors.35
pacing Modification of behaviour to prevent overexertion, improve function, manage 
symptoms, and reduce recurrence of pain, inactivity and disability.35
pain An unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with, or 
resembling that associated with, actual or potential tissue damage.35
patient education Education about health literacy, competencies and adaptation of behaviour. 
Patient education should consist of reassurance facilitated by elements of 
cognitive behavioural therapy. Reassurance takes place during the interaction 
between the clinician and the patient, during which information, instruction 
or persuasions are exchanged to reduce patients’ worries and fears of 
illness, and recommendations are translated into action in daily life. Patient 
education is part of informed consent to treatment. It enhances expectations 
of management and improves adherence to treatment strategies.35
physical activity Movement of the body. It can be structured (for example, walking groups, 
exercise classes, gym or pool-based exercise) or unstructured, involving 
activities of daily living (for example, playing, working, mobilising, house 
chores, recreational activities). Physical activity can be aerobic (endurance), or 
focused on strengthening, flexibility, coordination or balance.35
See staying active
recurrent pain 
(also referred to as 
episodic pain)Pain that occurs episodically over three months or more. Each episode 
is similar in presentation – it may be recurrent acute nociceptive pain or 
episodes of a chronic pain condition.35 
See acute low back pain , chronic low back pain  and nociceptive pain
risk assessment 
(also referred to as 
risk stratification)A process that aims to improve the outcome by selecting treatments that may 
be more likely to work in certain groups of people. There are several methods 
of stratification, which are similar in outcome. The STarT Back risk assessment 
tool is an example of a validated tool for stratification by risk of ongoing 
functional impairment.82
self-management Methods a patient uses to limit the impact of pain on their daily lives, their 
mood and functions (for example, sleep), whether at home or at work.107 
52 | Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care
Glossary Term Definition
serious underlying 
pathologyExisting conditions that may be influencing pain, such as cancer, infection, 
trauma or inflammatory disease such as spondyloarthritis.82 
social connection Feeling close to, or belonging with, an individual or community. Social 
connection occurs when a person feels safe, seen, heard and valued. Its 
absence triggers threat pathways and worsens pain experience, negatively 
affects health and wellbeing, and is associated with increased mortality.35
staying active Continuing with normal daily activities as much as possible, including going to 
work. It also means avoiding sitting still for long periods. Staying active does 
not mean participating in any specific exercises.34,90
