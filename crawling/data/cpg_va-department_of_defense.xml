TREATMENT  OF LOW  BACK  PAIN  
Department of Veterans Affairs  
Department of Defense 
QUALIFYING STATEMENTS  
The Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of Defense guidelines are based upon the best 
information available at the time of publication. They are designed to provide information and assist  
decision making. They are not intended to define a standard of care and should not be construed as one. Neither should they be interpreted as prescribing an exclusive course of management.  
This Clinical Practice G uideline is based on a systematic review of both clinical and epidemiological 
evidence. Developed by a panel of multidisciplinary experts, it provides a clear explanation of the logical 
relationships between various  care options and health outcomes while rating both the quality of the 
evidence and the strength of the recommendation.  
Variations in practice will inevitably and appropriately occur when clinicians ta ke into account the needs of 
individual patients, available resources, and limitations unique  to an institution or type of practice. Every 
healthcare professional making use of these guidelines is responsible for evaluating the appropriateness of 
applying them in the setting of any particular clinical situation  with a patient -centered approach. 
These guidelines are not intended to represent Department of Veterans Affairs or TRICARE policy. Further, inclusion of recommendations for specific testing and/or therapeutic interventions within these guidelines 
does not guarantee coverage of civilian sector care. Additional information on current TRICARE benefits 
may be found at www.tricare.mil  by contacting your regional TRICARE Managed Care Support Contractor.

 125  VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Low Back Pain  
February 2022   Page 5 of 141 I.Introduction
The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and Department of Defense (DoD) Evidence -Based Practice Work 
Group (EBPWG) was established and first chartered in 2004, with a mission to advise the Health Executive 
Committee (HEC) “…  on the use of clinical and epidemiological evidence to improve the health of the 
population …” acr oss the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) and Military Health System (MHS), by 
facilitating the development of clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) for the VA and DoD populations .(1) 
Development and update of VA/DoD CPGs  is funded by VA Evidence Based Practice, Office of Quality  and 
Patient Safety. The  system -wide goal of evidence -based CPG s is to improve patient health and well- being.   
In 2017, the VA and DoD published a CPG for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Low Back Pain ( 2017 VA/ 
DoD LBP CPG), which was based on evidence reviewed on or after December 2006 to October  2016. 
Since the release of that CPG , a growing body of r esearch has expanded the evidence base  and 
understanding of low back pain (LBP). Consequently, the VA/DoD EBPWG initiated the update of the 
2017 VA/DoD LBP CPG in 2020. This updated CPG’s use of GRADE reflects a more rigorous application of 
the methodology than previous iterations. Consequently, the strength of some recommendations may have been modified due to the confidence in the quality of the supporting evidence (see  Evidence 
Quality and Recommendation Strength ). 
This CPG provide s an evidence -based framework for the diagnosis and treatment of  patients with acute, 
subacute, or chronic LBP  with or without neuro logical symptoms  with the aim of  improv ing clinical 
outcomes. Successful implementation of this CPG  will: 
•Assi
st provide rs in a ssess ing the patient’s condition and collaborat ing with the patient, family, and 
caregivers to determine optimal management of pa tient care
•Em
phasiz e the use of patient -centered care and shared decision making
•Mi
nimize preventable complications and morbidity
•Opt
imize individual health outcomes and quality of life  (QoL)
II.Background
A.Description of Low Back Pain
LBP has been defined as pain, muscle tension, or stiffness localized below the costal margin and above the 
inferior gluteal folds with or without leg symptoms. (2) Categorizations defined by duration vary but are 
often delineated as acute (less than four weeks), subacute (4 – 12 weeks), or chronic (more than 12 weeks) 
(see the g lossary in Appendix F  for additional definitions). Anatomical contributors to LBP may be present; 
however “non -specific” LBP , in which it is not possible to detect a discrete source, is common and occurs in 
up to 85% of cases .(3) LBP is influenced by the interplay of physical, psychological, social, lifestyle, co -
morbid health, and modifiable and non- modifiable health factors. The relative contribution and interaction 
of these factors is variable, fluctuating , and unique to each individual with LBP and is reflected in the 
individual’s pain, distress , and coping (behavioral) respons es which influence levels of disability. (4) Given
the potential for multifactorial contributors to the pain experience, patients with LBP  can range from low 
to high levels of complexity. VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Low Back Pain  
February 2022   Page 6 of 141 Conducting a history and physical examination is considered standard of care and a cornerstone of clinical 
decision making. History and physical examination should include assessm ent of signs and symptoms of 
serious underlying pathology. Signs and symptoms of  serious underlying pathology requiring additional 
diagnostic workup and prompt treatment are generally referred to as “red flags.” Table 1  lists red flags and 
serious spinal conditions warranting further investigation.

B.Epidemiology and Impact
a.General Population
LBP is one of the most frequently experienced medical  conditions  in the general population, with up to 
84% of adults in the United States ( U.S.) experiencing LBP at some point in their lives. (5) In 2016, of all 
diseases and injuries contributing to disability- adjusted life years in the U.S ., LBP was ranked fifth .(6) LBP is 
now the leading cause of disability worldwide. (7)  
In 2019 , approximately 39% of adults 18 years and older in the U.S. reported experiencing LBP in the last 
three months. (8) Additionally, w omen are more likely than men to experience LB P (40.6% versus 37.2 %, 
respectively). (8) More than two -thirds of pregnant women experience LBP , and symptoms typically 
increase with advancing pregnancy; however, pregnancy- related LBP is often self -limited in the post -
partum period and may require specialist care only when LBP persists beyond a reasonable period or if red 
flags are present. (9)  VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Low Back Pain  
February 2022   Page 7 of 141 In a study of U.S. healthcare costs from 1996 through 2016, spending related to LBP and neck pain was 
the highest out of 154 conditions. In 2016, the estimated spending related to LBP and neck pain was 
$134.5 billion. (10) 
LBP and neurogenic claudication can be caused by degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) which 
shows increasing prevalence wit h age (20% in &lt;40 years and 47.2% in &gt;60 years). (11) Patients with LSS 
are three times more likely to experience LBP than those without it. (11) 
LBP can be associated with lumbar radiculopathy, which has an estimated prevalence of 3% – 5% of the 
population.( 12) Degenerative disorders are considered the primary etiology.   
b.Veterans Affairs Population
The 2010 – 2014 National Health  Interview Surveys (NHIS) from the National Institutes of Health provided 
national prevalence estimates of U.S. Veterans with severe pain (including back pain). A sub- analysis of the 
survey published in 2017 showed that 33% of Veterans reported significant back pain in the prior three months. The back pain was axial in 20% of Veterans and had features of  lower extremity involvement in 
12%. Among Veterans with back pain, 22% reported it as severe and were more likely to have severe back pain compared to n on-Veterans. (13) An NHIS was completed again in 2015 – 2018 providing national 
prevalence estimates of U.S. Veterans with chronic pain (27.9%), but data specifically related to LBP was not reported. (14) 
c.Department of Defense Population
In the annual Medical Surveillance Monthly Report burden of disease issue, “other back problems” has 
been the category responsible for the most medical encounters fo r active duty U.S. Armed Service 
Members every year since 2011. In 2020, this category was the primary diagnosis for more than one  
million medical encounters affecting 213,331 Service Members. (15) 
During the years 2010 -2014, t he overall annual incidence of LBP was 12.0%  among active duty Service 
Members.  Of patients with LBP, 88.3% received a diagnosis of “non- specific LBP ,” but many received more 
than one diagnosis for LBP, including degenerative changes (14.1%), herniated disc (9.7%), and spinal stenosis (1.8%). A breakdown of the annual incidence of LBP by gender, service, race, and occupation is 
available  in Table 2 .(16)

III.Scope of this Guideline
This CPG is based on published clinical evidence and related information available through 
February 1, 2021. It is intended to provide general guidance on best evidence -based practices (see 
Appendix A  for additional information on the evidence review methodology). This CPG is not intended to 
serve as a standard of care .  
A.Guideline A udience
This CPG is intended for use by VA and DoD primary care providers (PCPs)  and others involved in the
healthcare team caring for patients with LBP and associate d conditions . Additionally, this CPG  is
intended for community- based clinicians involved i n the care of Service Members , beneficiaries,  or
Veterans with LBP .
B.Guideline Population
The patient population of interest for this CPG is adults (ages 18 years or older)  with acute, subacute, or 
chronic LBP with or without neurological symptoms, who are eligible for care in the VA or  DoD 
healthcare delivery systems  and those who receiv e care from community -based clinicians. It includes 
Veterans and Service Members as well as their dependents . Recommended interventions in this CPG are 
applicable regardless of care setting, unless otherwise indicated, for  any patient in the VA and DoD 
healthcare system .  
Management of LBP from visceral disorders, fracture, cancer, infection, inflammatory arthropathy, or 
other causes is beyond the scope of this CPG. Pregnant women are also excluded from the scope of this 
CPG.  
IV.Highlighted Features of this Guideline
A.Highlights in this Guideline Update
The current document is an update to the 2017 VA/DoD LBP CPG. A continued strength of this CPG is the
multidisciplinary stakeholder involvement from its inception, ensuring representation from the broad 
spectrum of clinicians engaged in the diagnosis and treatment of LBP.
The 2022 VA/DoD LBP CPG Work Group developed 12 key questions  (KQs)  which drove the systematic 
evidence review. Consistent with the 2017 VA/DoD LBP CPG, surgical interventions were excluded from  VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Low Back Pain  
February 2022   Page 9 of 141 the systematic ev idence review for t his CP G.  The KQ topics included t he p rogn ostic/clinica l impact o f 
differe
nt evaluation tools a nd ri sk factors  on LBP o utcome s. In a ddition to t he review of effectivene ss of  
clinicia
n-directed and self-directed phy sical  activit y and exe rcise, a KQ also assessed c linician -dire cted 
and self-directe d interventions f or behavioral health affecting the  outco me of LBP.  The impact o f 
assessment  and tr eatment of c oncom itant m ental health condition s, pa in cata strophizing , and 
p
sycho so
cial stre ssor s on LB P outcomes and the e ffectivene ss of  technology -based  modalities f or self -
management w ere also r eviewed.  
Other upda t
es include a n initial or e xpanded l iterature  search into c omplementary a nd integr ative he alth 
(CIH) a nd whole /holistic health approache s, ort ho-bio logic i njecti ons, bo tulinum t oxin i njecti ons, 
neuromodul
ation treatments, spinal c ord stimulation, t echnology- based m odalities, a nd pharmacologic 
interv

Finally
, the 2022 VA/DoD L BP CPG i ncludes t he 2017 r e commendation categorization table  (see 
Appe

D) for easier v isualiz ation o f similarit ies a nd differences b etween t he two versi ons of t he CP G. 
The 
2022 
VA/DoD LBP CPG used a m ore r igorous a ppli cation of t he methodology than previous iterations.

VI.Summary of Guideline Development Method ology
The methodology used in developing this CPG follows the Guideline for Guidelines , an internal document 
of the VA /DoD EBPWG updated in January 2019 that outlines procedures for developing  and submitting 
VA/DoD CPG s.(17) The Guideline for Guidelines  is available at  
http://www.healthquality.va.gov/policy/index.asp. This CPG  also aligns with  the National Academy of 
Medicine’s (NAM) principles of trustworthy CPG s (e.g., explanation of evidence quality and strength, the 
management of potential conflicts of interest [ COI], interdisciplinary stakeholder involvement, use of 
systematic review  (SR), and external review). (18) Appendix  A provides a detailed description of the CPG  
development methodology . 
A.Evidence Quality and Recommendation Strength
The Work Group used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation 
(GRADE) approach to craft each recommendation and determine its strength. Per GRADE approach,
recommendations must be evidence -based and cannot be made based on expert opinion alone. The VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Low Back Pain  
February 2022   Page 12 of 141 GRADE approach uses the following four domains to inform  the strength of each recommendation (see 
Determining Recommen dation Strength and Direction):( 19) 
•Confidence in the quality of the evidence
•Ba
lance of desirable and undesirable outcomes
•Pa
tient valu es and preferences
•Ot
her considerations , as appropriate, e.g.:
♦Resource use
♦Equity
♦Acceptability
♦Feasibility
♦Subgroup considerations
Using these four domains, the Work Group determined the relative strength of each recommendation 
(Strong  or Weak ). The strength of a recommendation is defined as the extent to which one can be 
confident that the desirable effects of an intervention outweigh its undesirable effects and is based on the framework above, which incorporates the four domains. (20) A Strong  recommendation generally indicates 
High  or Moderate  confidence in the quality of the available evidence, a clear difference in magnitude 
between the benefits and harms of an intervention, similar patient values and preferences, and 
understood influence of other implications (e.g., resource use, feasibility).  
In some instances , there is insufficient evidence on which to base a recommendation for or against a 
particular therapy, preventive measure, or other intervention . For example, the systematic evidence 
review may have found little or no relevant evidence, inconclusive evidence, or conflicting evidence  for the 
intervention. The manner in which this is expressed in the CPG  may vary. In such instances , the Work 
Group may include among its set of recommendations a statement of insufficient evidence for a n 
intervention that may be in common  practice even though it is not supported by clinical evidence, and 
particularly if there may be other risks of continuing its use (e.g., high opportunity cost, misallocation of 
resources). In other cases, the Work Group may decide  to not inclu de this type of statement  about an 
intervention. For example, the Work Group may remain silent where  there is an absence of evidence for a  
rarely used intervention. In other cases , an intervention may have a favorable balance of benefits and 
harms but may be a standard of care for which no recent evidence has been generated. 
Using these elements, the Work Group determines the strength and direction of each recommendation and formulates the recommendation with the general corresponding text (see Table 4).   VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Low Back Pain  
February 2022   Page 13 of 141 Table 4. Strength and Direction of Recommendations and General Corresponding Text  
Recommendation Strength and Direction General Corresponding Text 
Strong for We recommend … 
Weak for We suggest … 
Neither for nor against There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against … 
Weak against We suggest against … 
Strong against We recommend against … 
It is important to note that a re commendation’s strength (i.e., Strong  versus Weak ) is distinct from its 
clinical importance  (e.g., a Weak  recommendation is evidence -based and still important to clinical care ). 
The strength of each recommendation is shown in the Recommendations  section . 
This CPG’s use of GRADE  reflects a more rigorous application of the methodology  than previous 
iterations. For instance, the determination of the strength of the recommendation is more directly 
linked to the  confidence in the  quality of the evidence on outcomes that are critical to clinical decision  
making. The confidence in the quality of the evidence is assessed using an objective, systematic approach that is independent of the clinical topic of interest. Therefore, recommendations on topics for 
which it may be inherently more difficult to design and conduct rigorous studies (e.g., randomized 
controlled trials [ RCTs ]) are typically supported by lower quality evidence and, in turn, Weak 
recommendations. Recommendations on topics for which rigorous studies can be designed and 
conducted may more often be Strong recommendations. Per GRADE, if the quality of evidence differs 
across the relevant critical outcomes, the lowest quality of evidence for any of the critical outcomes determines the overall quality of the evidence for a recommendatio n.(21, 22) This stricter standard 
provides a consistent approach to determining recommendation strengths. For additional information 
on GRADE or CPG methodology, see  Appendix A . 
B.Categorization of 2017 Clinical Practice Guideline Recommendations
Evidence -based CPGs should be current. Except for an original version of a new CPG , this typically requires 
revision of a CPG’s previous versions based on new evidence or as scheduled subject to time -based 
expirations. (23) For example, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) has a process for 
monitoring the emergence of new evidence that could prompt an update of its recommendations, and it 
aims to review each topic at least every five years for either an update or reaffirmation .(24)  
Recommendation ca tegories were used to track  how the previous CPG’s recommendations could be  
reconciled . These categories  and their corresponding definitions  are similar to  those used by the National 
Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE, England). (25, 26) Table 5 lists these categories, which  are 
based on whether the evidence supporting a recommendation was systematically reviewed, the degree to 
which the previous CPG’s recommendation  was modified and whethe r a previous CPG’s recommendation 
is relevant in the updated CPG.  
Additional information regarding these categories and their definitions can be found in Recommendation  Categorization . The 2022 CPG recommendation categories  can be found in 
Recommendations . Appendix D outlines the 2017 VA/DoD LBP CPG’s recommendation c ategories .  VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Low Back Pain

C.Management of Potential or Actual Conflicts of Interest
Management of COIs  for the CPGs is conducted as described in the Guideline for Guidelines .(17) Further,
the Guideline for Guidelines  refers to details in the VHA Handbook 1004.07 Financial Relationships
between VHA Health Care Professionals and Industry (November 2014, issued by the VHA National Center 
for Ethics in Health Care), (27) as well as to disclosure statements  (i.e., the standard disclosure f orm that is
completed at least twice by CPG Work Group members and the guideline development team) .(17) The
disclosure form inquires  regarding  any relevant financial and intellectual interests or other relationships 
with, e.g., manufacturers of commercial products, providers of commercial services, or other commercial interests. The disclosure f orm also inquires  regarding  any other relationships or activities that could be 
perceived to have influenced, or that give the appearance of potentially influencing, a respondent’s
contributions to the CPG.  In addition, instances of potential or actual COIs  among the CPG Work Group and 
the guideline development team  were also subject to random web- based identification via standard 
electronic means (e.g., Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services Open Payments and/or ProPublica).
When an instance of potential or actual COI has  been reported, it is referred to the VA and DoD program 
offices and reviewed with the CPG Work Group Champions. The VA and DoD program offices and the CPG Work Group Champions determine whether, and if so, what, further action is appropriate (e.g., excusi ng 
Work Group members from selected relevant deliberations or removal from the Work Group). Early in the Work Group formation , a surgeon (AD) was identified to have a potential conflict related to development 
of a surgical implant. It was determined that mitigation was not possible and the individual was removed from the Work Group. Disclosure forms are on file with the VA Office of Quality and Patient Safety and are 
available upon request.   VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Low Back Pain  
February 2022   Page 15 of 141 D.Patient Perspective
When developing a CPG, consideration should be given to patient  perspectives and experiences, which
often  vary from those of providers .(21, 28) Focus groups can be used to help collect qualitative data on
patient perspective s and experiences . VA and DoD Leadership arranged a virtual patient focus group on
December 10, 2020. The focus group aimed to gain insights into  patients with LBP of potential relevance
and incorporate these into the CPG as appropriate. Topics discussed included the patients’ priorities, 
challenges they have experienced, information they have received regarding their care, and the impacts of 
their care on their lives.
The patient focus group comprised a  convenience sample of seven people . There were five males and 
two females. Four participants were Veterans who received care from the VA health system, and three 
participants received care from the DoD health system (two of which were active duty Service Members). The Work Group acknowledge s this convenience sample is not representative of all patients 
with LBP within the VA and DoD healthcare systems and, thus, findings are not generalizable and do not 
comprise evidence. For more information on the patient focus group methods and findings , see 
Appendix B . Patient  focus group participants were provided the opportunity to review the final draft and 
provide additional feedback.  
E.External  Peer  Review
The Work Group drafted, reviewed, and edited this CPG using an iterative process. For more information, 
see Drafting and Finalizing the Guideline . Once the Work Group completed  a near -final draft,  they 
identified experts  from the VA and DoD healthcare  systems  and outside organizations generally viewed as 
experts in the respective field to review th at draft. The draft  was sent to those experts  for a 14- business -
day review and comment  period . The Work Group considered a ll feedback from the peer reviewers  and 
modified the CPG where justified, in accordance with the evidence.  Detailed information on the external 
peer review can be provided by the V A Office of Quality and Patient Safety.   
F.Implementation
This CPG and algorithm are designed for adaptation by individual healthcare providers with consideration of unique patient considerations and preferences, local needs, and resources. The algorithm serves as a 
tool to prompt providers to consider key decision points in the care for a patient with LBP . Robust 
implementation is identified in  VA and DoD internal implementation plans  and policies. Additionally , 
implementation would entail wide dissemination through publication in the medical literature, online 
access, educational programs, and, ideally, electronic medical record programming in the form of clinical 
decision support tools at the point of care.  
VII.Approach  to Care  in Department  of Veterans  Affairs  and  
Department  of Defense
A.Patient-centered Care
Guideline recommendations are intended to consider patient needs and preferences. Guideline 
recommendations  represent a whole/holistic health approach to care that is  patient -centered, cul turally
appropriate, and available to people with limited literacy skills and physical, sensory, or learning  VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Low Back Pain  
February 2022   Page 16 of 141 disabilities.  VA/DoD CPGs encourage providers to use a  patient -centered , whole/holistic health  approach 
(i.e., individualized treatment based on patient needs, characteristics, and preferences) . This approach 
aims to treat the particular condition while also optimizing  the individual’s overall health and well -being.  
Regardless of the  care setting, all patients should have  access  to individualized  evidence -based care. 
Patient -centered care can  decrease patient anxiety, increase trust in clinicians, and improve treatment 
adherence. (29, 30) A whole/holistic health approach ( https://www.va.gov/wholehealth/ ) empowers and 
equips  individuals to meet their personal health and well -being goals. Good communication is essential 
and should be supported by evidence -based information tailo red to each patient’s needs. An 
empathetic and non- judgmental approach facilitates discussions sensitive to gender, culture, ethnicity, 
and other differences.  
B.Shared Decision Making
This CPG encourage s providers  to practice  shared decision making, which is a process in which providers 
and patients consider clinical evidence of benefits and risks as well as patient values and preferences to 
make decisions regarding the patient’s treatment .(31) Shared decision making  was emphasized in Crossing 
the Quality Chasm,  an Institute of Medicine (IOM) (now  NAM) report, in 2001,( 32) and is inherent within 
the whole/holistic health approach.  Providers  must be adept at presenting information to their patients 
regarding individual treatments, expected risks, expected o utcomes, and levels and/or setti ngs of care , 
especially where  there may be patient heterogeneity in  risks and benefits.  The VHA  and MHS  have 
embraced shared decision making. Providers  are encouraged to use shared decision making  to 
individualize treatment goals and plans based on patient capabilities, needs, and preferences.   
C.Patients with Co -occurring Conditions
Co-occurring conditions can modify the degree of risk, impact diagnosi s, influence patient and provider 
treatment priorities and clinical decisions, and affect the overall approach to the management of LBP.(33, 34) Many Veterans, Service Members, and their families have one or more  co-occurring 
conditions . Because LBP is sometimes accompanied by co-occurring conditions , it is often best to 
manage LBP collaboratively with other care providers. Some co -occurring conditions  may require early 
specialist consultation to determine  any necessary changes in treatment or to establish a common 
understanding of how care will be coordinated. This may entail refere nce to other VA/DoD CPGs  
(e.g.,  for use of opioids for chronic paina).

February 2022   Page 17 of 141 VIII.Algorithm
This CPG’s algorithm is designed to facilitate understanding of the clinical pathway and decision making 
process used in managing patients with  LBP. This algorithm format represents a simplified flow of the 
management of patients with LBP and helps foster efficient decision making by providers. It includes:  
•An 
ordered sequence of steps of care
•De
cisions to be considered 
•Re
commended decision criteria
•Ac
tions to be taken
The algorithm is a step -by-step decision tree. Standardized symbols are used to display each step, and 
arrows connect the numbered boxes indicating the order in which the steps should be followe d.(35) 
Sidebars provide more detailed information to assist in defining and interpreting elements in the boxes.

IX.Recommendations
The following  evidence -based clinical practice  recommendations were made  using a systematic approach 
considering four domains as per the GRADE approach (see Summary of Guideline Development 
Methodology ). These domains include:  confidence in the quality of the evidence, balance of desirable and 
undesirable outcomes (i.e., benefits and harms), patient values and preferences, and other implications 
(e.g., resourc e use, equity, acceptability).  
Recommendations for “patients with low back pain” encompass patient populations with acute, subacute,  
or chronic LBP with or without neurological symptoms . Recommendations specific to one or more LBP  
types include additional detail regarding the patient population.   VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Low Back Pain

Recommendation
1.For patients with low back pain, we recommend the history and physical examination include
evaluation for progressive or otherwise serious neurologic deficits and other red flags
(e.g.,  signs, symptoms, history) associated with serious underlying pathology (e.g., malignancy,
fracture, infection).b
(St
rong for  | Reviewed, Amended )
Discussion  
Evidence suggests that  clinicians should specifically identify the presence, duration, progression, and 
severity of neurologic symptoms about red flag  signs , symptoms , and history .  
An SR by Galliker et al. (2020) evaluated  10 individual studies with &gt;4,000 patients visiting an emergency 
department (ED) in which several red flags were associated  with moderate to large effect sizes for 
increase d risk of epidural abscess, vertebral fracture, cancers , and  serious spinal pathologies .(36) Red flag 
symptoms included, but were not limited to, new urinary retention and current anticoagulant treatment . 
Red flag signs included, but were not limited to,  saddle sensation disturbance, bladder/suprapubic fullness, 
abnormal neurologic exam, bowel/bladder sphincter disturbance, fever or other signs of infection, and hemoglobin &lt;100 g/L, and INR &gt; 1. For detect ion of epidural abscess, there was an increased risk in patients 
with a history of intravenous (IV) drug use and other infection sites (likelihood ratio [LR]+:13.7) , an 
indwelling vascular catheter (LR+: 15.7) , or a history of recent spine fracture (LR+: 9 .5). For detection of 
vertebral fracture, there was a large risk with a history of trauma with neurological findings on physical 
examination (LR+: 31.1). For detection of cancer -causing LBP , there was a large risk with a combination of 
a history of cancer and the clinical suspicion of cancer (LR+: 27.9).  
Rapidly progressive , severe neurologic deficits or LBP associated with a serious underlying condition 
(e.g.,  malignancy, fracture, infection, cauda equina syndrome [CES]) may necessitate additional diagnos tic 
workup and prompt treatment. (37) A small proportion of LBP may be caused by a specific identifiable 
underlying condition (e.g., malignancy: 0.7%, infection : 0.01%, vertebral compression fracture : 4%), (37) 
including the possibility of referred pain from a proximate organ system (e.g., pancreatitis, nephrolithiasis, aortic aneurysm, endocarditis).  
There was m oderate quality evidence supporting the utility of red flags to determine the likelihood of 
malignancy and fracture, (37) and low quality evidence that red flag s by themselves indicate a high risk for 
epidural abscess, vertebral fracture, and cancer. (36) Findings from the current systematic evidence review  
are consistent with the studies included in the 2017 VA/DoD LBP CPG , which were conducted in a greater 
variety of patient populations. (38-40) History of malignancy is associated with a higher risk of identifying 
serious underlying causes of LBP .(39) In patients with unexplained weight loss, failure to improve after one 
month, or age greater than 50 years, the likelihood of cancer as the cause of LBP increased to 
approximately 1.2%. (40) A nother study of nearly 700 patients suggested the following red flags indicated a 
higher ris k for vertebral fracture: older age (≥75 years  old),  recent trauma, os teoporosis,  s evere back pain 
b  Recommendations for “patients with low back pain” encompass patient populations with acute, subacute, or chronic LBP with 
or without neurological symptoms.   VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Low Back Pain  
February 2022   Page 27 of 141 score ≥7 out of 10, and thoracic pain. (38) The study also suggested the presence of multiple red flags 
increases the probability of fracture to between 42% and 90%. Deyo et al. (1988) reported a history of 
urinary retention indicating a higher risk of CES, a rare condition with an estimated prevalence  of 0.04% 
among patients presenting with LBP. In patients without urinary retention, the probability of CE S was 
approximately 0.01%. (40) 
Patient values and preferences were similar regarding evaluation of their LBP.  The patient focus group 
participants valued the use of shared decision making in which the provider actively  listened to their 
problems, carefully considered the underlying causes of their condition, and developed an individualized 
plan for their management . Most patients wish to have any ser ious underlying condition identified early 
and treated appropriately. While patients value a detailed and probing assessment for  red flags  to 
determine the need for further diagnostic evaluation, many patients  express frustration and believe that 
their evaluation is not complete without imaging studies (especially use of magnetic resonance imaging 
[MRI]) for determining the cause of their LBP.   
The Work Group systematically reviewed new  evidence related to this recommendation ( 36) and also 
considered the evidence put forth in the 2017 VA/DoD LBP CPG. (37-40) Therefore, this is a Reviewed, 
Amended recommendation. The Work Group’s confidence in the quality of the evidence was very low  for 
detection of serious spinal pathologies by history/symptoms or physical examination. The quality of  the 
body of evidence was limited by factors such as  retrospective study design, not using the same reference 
standard in all patients, and no clear blinding of assessors .(36) However, despite the very low quality of 
evidence for the critical outcome of interest  (diagnostic accuracy), the Work Group concluded this 
recommendation continued to  merit a Strong  for rating  considering  the high likelihood of catastrophic 
harms from a failure to identify a serious underlying condition that is causing LBP. The prevention of disability, morbidity , and mortality and the  life-preserving benefits of conducting  a history and physical 
examination to identify red flag s for serious underlying medical conditions  outweigh very small potential 
for harms to the patient (e.g., the likelihood of false -positive red flags leading to unnecessary additional 
diagnostic testing, inherent risks and increased costs with such tests, fear or anxiety that a patient may experience while undergoing such tests). Per GRADE guidelines: 15, which states, “A strong 
recomme ndation may be warranted . . . when low quality evidence suggests benefit in a life -threatening 
situation,” the Work Group determined  a Strong  recommendation is warranted. (19) Patient values and 
preferences were similar because patients prefer that their clinician carefully evaluate them for underlying causes of their clinical condition . The Work Group believes that  all clinicians must be familiar with red flags 
that warrant further evaluation and emphasize that here.  Conducting a history and physical examination 
including assessment of neurological deficits and red flags is generally feasible and accepted by the 
providers and patients alike. Thus, the Work Group decided upon a Strong for  recommendation.   VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Low Back Pain

Discussion  
Evidence suggests most patients with lumbar disc herniation and radiculopathy will improve with 
noninvasive management within four weeks .(41) Chou et al. (2009) found that imaging (e.g., radiographs, 
computed tomography [CT], MRI) did not significantly improve outcomes in patients for whom there was 
no pretest concern for serious underlying conditions. (42) L ittle additional  literature  has been published 
more recently . An SR by Galliker et al. (2020) of 10 diagnostic cohort studies attempted to gather evidence 
for red  flags predictive of serious spinal pathology. (36) Analyzed red flags included suspicion or history of 
cancer, IV drug use, indwelling vascular catheter, and other infection site s.(36) Unfortunately, this analysis 
yielded very low  quality evidence due to very serious limitations and s erious imprecision.  The Work Group 
noted  that the laboratory and imaging tests in question posed relatively little harm ; however, the re is 
enormous harm caused by failure to diagnose a serious pathology.  
Patient values and preferences are likely  very similar, as patients uniformly want to know about serious 
underlying pathology. Most patients wish to have any serious underlying condition identified early and 
treated appropriately. Identifying and treating serious pathology at an earlier stage is beneficial in terms 
of resource use and is acceptable and feasible to patients and providers.  
Although the quality of evidence related to this recommendation from the current systematic evidence 
review was very low, the Work Group was strongly persuaded by the potential harm mediated by withholding laboratory and imaging studies from patients with red flags. The recommendation was 
further bolstered by the moderate quality evidence used to support this recommendation in the 
2017 VA/DoD LBP CPG. (41, 42) 
The Work Group systematically reviewed evidence related to this recommendation (36) and considered 
the assessment of the evidence put forth in the 2017 VA/DoD LBP CPG. (41, 42) Therefore, this is a 
Reviewed, Amended recommendation. The Work Group’s confidence in the quality of the evidence was 
very low . The body of evidence had some limitations including patient selection limited to the emergent 
setting and lack of standard or precise means of diagnosis confirmation. However, despite the very low 
quality of evidence, the Work Group concluded this recommendation continued to  merit a Strong for

underlying condition that is causing LBP. The prevention of disability, morbidity, and mortality and the  
life-preserving benefits of conducting diagnostic imaging and appropriate laboratory testing when 
neurologic deficits are progressive or otherwise serious or when other red flags are present outweigh 
the very small potential for harms (e.g., increased time, resource use, and potential incidental findings).

Recommendation  
3.For patients with acute low back pain, without focal neurologic deficits or other red flags
(e.g.,  signs, symptoms, history), we recommend against routinely obtaining imaging studies or
performing invasive diagnostic tests.(Strong against  | Reviewed, New -replaced )
Discussion  
Since the 2017 VA/DoD LBP CPG, additional evidence has been published supporting the recommendation that  early imaging is associated with the potential of worse  clinical outcomes. Using a very large 
retrospective matched cohort (n= 405,965) to as sess patients presenting with non- specific pain of the 
lumbar spine, including lumbar sprain, strain, spondylosis, or disk degeneration, Jacobs et al. (2020) 
evaluated the downstream consequences of lumbar MRI performed within six weeks of symptom 
onset. (43) The study evaluated uncomplicated LBP  in a VA primary care clinic from June 1, 2015 , through 
June 30, 2016, and found MRI of the lumbar spine performed early after onset of LBP symptoms was 
associated with a higher probability of surgery, greater prescription opioid use, increased costs of care, and 
higher pain scores.  
In this study, the early MRI group was 13 times more likely to undergo lumbar surgery than the group not 
receiving an early scan (1.48% versus 0. 12%). (43) Further , early MRI was associated with greater opioid 
use and higher pain levels, which may further contribute to the opioid crisis occurring within the U.S. In addition, associated acute care costs were 1.4 times greater in the early lumbosacral -MRI group during the 
follow -up period ($8,082 v ersu s $5,560). It is worth noti ng that this study was performed at the VA, where 
providers are typically salaried and may not have the same financial incentives associated with traditional fee-for-service care. Alternatively, because VA providers receive malpractice coverage through the  federal 
government, they may not have  the same liability concerns as their non- governmental counterparts when 
considering ordering diagnostic tests.   
Similarly, Lemmers et al. (2019) demonstrated that in patients with LBP who did not have red flags, routi ne 
imaging led to increased costs, healthcare utilization, and absence from work. (44) They concluded that 
imaging did not provide health benefits and suggested medical imaging was often performed because of a 
clinician’s need for a diagnosis, to identify an anatomical defect,  to meet the expectations of patients, or 
for financial incentives. In total, the SR included six RCTs and eight observational studies, which included radiography, CT, and MRI. For both Jacobs et al. (2020)  (43) and Lemmers et al. (2019), (44) the quality of 
evidence was moderate with harms and burdens outweighing benefits.  
The Work Group felt there was likely large variation in values and preferences for patients experiencing 
LBP of less than six weeks. Patients experiencing LBP often wish to understand the source of their symptoms , and imaging has traditionally been used to reduce fears and/or concerns. During the patient 
focus group , four participants shared difficulties obtaining MRIs early in the diagnostic process, which they 
felt would have allowed providers to pinpoint the underlying causes of their LBP  sooner . Participants  VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Low Back Pain  
February 2022   Page 30 of 141 favored receiving advanced imaging, especially MRIs, early in the assessment process, as they believed 
imaging would have helped identify the cause of pain earlier.  
When patients inquire about imaging modalities for axial LBP of less  than six weeks duration, providers are 
encouraged to provide appropriate education on the limitations of these modalities. These  include the 
findings of potentially higher pain scores, greater prescription opioid use, and increased chance for 
surgery. In addition, discussion of evidence -based treatments for acute LBP known to provide clinical 
benefit should be performed. Furthermore, healthcare utilization costs have implications for  resource 
allocation, especially when the harms outweigh the benefits. Finally, some providers may not have access 
to advanced imaging or testing, and routine use may place an additional burden on the provider and 
healthcare system.   
The Work Group systematically reviewed evidence related to this recommendation ( 43, 44) and 
considered the assessment of the evidence put forth in the 2017 VA/DoD LBP CPG. (42, 45-47) Therefore, 
this is a Reviewed, New -replaced recommendation. When determining the strength of this 
recommendation, the Work Group considered the moderate confidence in the quality of available 
evidence, the potential for harms/burdens to outweigh the benefits, and the feasibility and resource 
constraints of routine imaging. Patient and provider preferences may vary, but patient education and 
discussion of treatment options are generally preferred over diagnostic imaging when red flags are not 
identified. Other implications include resource use, equity, and acceptability. There is a high cost 
associated w ith frequently imaging patients as well as the potential of providing information that may 
cause anxiety, such as descriptions of degenerative changes. Thus, the Work Group decided upon a Strong against  recommendation .

Discussion  
As noted in the 2017 VA/DoD LBP CPG, depression and anxiety are common among patients with chronic 
pain and are related to developing chronic LBP. (48, 49) Studies identified in the current systematic 
evidence review suggest assessing for psychosocial factors in patients with LBP can be helpful in treatment planning. (50-56) The STarT Back Screening Tool
e and the Orebro Musculoskeletal Pain Screening 
Ques tionnairef (OMPSQ) are screening instruments aimed at helping to  predict the risk of developing 
chronic pain, disability, and work absenteeism based on the presence of risk factors such as psychosocial 
factors. (57, 58) The STarT Back consists of nine questions regarding pain and psychosocial factors such as 
pain catastrophizing, worrying thoughts, and anhedonia while the OMPSQ consists of 25 items. Cut -off

February 2022   Page 31 of 141 scores divide patients into risk groups that help provider s recommend a treatment plan. An SR by Karran 
et al. (2017) suggested these instruments are excellent in predicting work absenteeism  outcomes and 
acceptable for disability  outcomes. (53) However, they are poor/non -informative at predicting pain 
outcomes at 3 – 12 month s follow -up.(53)  
Research suggests QoL and level of functioning for patients with LBP are relate d to psychosocial factors,  
but the strength of evidence was very low. One study of poor quality  among older adults  suggested that 
despite being in a  worse physical conditio n, those with a more positive outlook on their QoL  were more 
likely to improve after an invasive treatment. (56) Glatta cker et al. (2018) suggested baseline levels of pain 
catastrophizing and depression are associated with a patient’ s QoL at six month follow -up.(51) Løchting  et 
al. (2017) reported pain catastrophizing, illness perception, and psychological distress were related to QoL, 
functional status, and general health. (54) Tr inderup et al. (2018) suggested fear -avoidance beliefs about 
work were related to functional status. (55) 
There is some variability in pa tient and provider willingness to assess psychosocial factors related to LBP. 
Some patients are more biomedically focused and may question the relevance of psychosocial factors when seeking care. There can be a stigma related to assessing psychosocial factors as the patient may 
worry that the provider believes that the pain is “in their head” or “ not real.” From the provider's 
standpoint, assessing for psychosocial factors may  seem burdensome  (e.g., it requires additional time),  
and providers may be reluctant to change their practice to include an assessment measure such as the 
STarT Back tool. Consistent with the 2017 VA/DoD LBP CPG, this Work Group considered the benefits of screening for psychosocial factors to outweigh the burdens/harm.  
Providers interes ted in assessing psychosocial factors related to chronic pain in their clinical practice are 
encouraged to consider the following instruments utilized in studies from the current systematic evidence review.
  
• The most commonly used instrument for measuring pain catastrophizing is the Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS). (59) The PCS is a 13 -item self -report questionnaire assessing 
catastrophic thinking related to pain. The PCS has good psychometric properties and provides a total score as well as subscales of r umination,  magnification, and h elplessness.  
• The most commonly used  instrument for measuring pain self -efficacy is the Pain Self Efficacy 
Questionnaire (PSEQ). (60) The PSEQ is a 10 -item self -report questionnaire that assesses the 
confidence people hav e in performing various activities while in pain. The PSE Q has good 
psychometric prope rties and yields a total score.  
• The Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia (TSK) is a well -known instrument developed to measure the 
fear of movement related to chronic LBP. (61) The TSK is a 17 -item measure that has demonstrated 
good psychometric properties and yields a total score.  
The Work Group systematically reviewed evidence related this re commendation  (50-56) and considered 
the evidence put forth in the 2017 VA/DoD LBP CPG. (48, 49) Therefore, this is a Reviewed, New -replaced 
recommendation. Evidence from the current systematic evidence review , which included psycho social 
factors such as pain catastrophizing, fear avoidance, and pain self -efficacy,  is generally consistent with the 
2017 VA/DoD LBP CPG , which highlighted the relationship between mental health conditions , such as 
depression and anxiety, and the development or maintenance of chronic LBP.   VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Low Back Pain  
February 2022   Page 32 of 141 There is moderate strength  of evidence with higher quality studies for predictive screening instruments 
such as the STarT Back Tool and the OMPSQ compared to very low strength  of evidence for individual 
psychosocial fact ors. The body of evidence had some limitations including very serious limitations in study 
quality/risk of bias and serious imprecision of findings. M uch of the evidence supporting the use of the 
STarT Back was found in European studies; data from the U.S. was less compelling . For example, a large 
study (n= 1,701)  of moderate quality of evidence conducted in the U.S. did not demonstrate a  significant 
effect of STarT Back screening on patient outcomes of function, pain catastrophizing, pain self -efficacy , or 
healthcare utilization .(50) This suggests it may be difficult to implement these measures in clinical settings.   
The STarT Back Tool and the OMPSQ can help providers stratify risk for developing disability and failing to 
return to work. However, these instruments appear to be poor/non- informative predictors  of pain 
outcomes,  which was a critical outcome. The potential benefits of screening for psychosocial factors 
outweighed the potential harms of patients questioning the relevance of assessing for psychosocial 
factors . Patient values and preferences varied somewhat . Despite the very  low confidence in the quality of  
evidence, the Work Group determined it was important to assess for psychosocial factors and depression 
and anxiety as they are common among patients with chronic pain and contribute to a patient’s  overall 
level of suffering. Providers are encouraged to incorporate the findings into treatment planning  and 
consider behavioral health treatment approaches identified in this  CPG. Thus, the Work Group decided 
upon a Weak for  recommendation.  
Recommendatio n 
5.For patients with low back pain, with or without radicular symptoms, there is insufficient evidence 
to recommend for or against specific physical exam maneuvers to assist in the diagnosis of fa cet  orsacroiliac joint pain, or a lumbar/lumbo -sacral radiculopathy.
(Neither for nor against  | Reviewed, New -added)
Discussion  
Low quality and inconsistent evidence suggests performing relevant provocative tests may assist in the 
diagnosis of facet or sacroiliac joint pain or of lumbar/lumbosacral radiculopathy in patients with LBP with or without radicular symptoms. (62-66) However, there is high variability in diagnostic sensitivity 
and specificity.  
Maas et al. (2017) reported findings of an SR in which diagnostic facet joint block was used as a reference standard for detection of LBP originating from lumbar facet joints. (62) Two studies  within this 
SR found non- centralization of LBP had high sensitivity (100%) but very low specificity (11% – 17%) for 
detection of facet joint -mediated LBP. (67, 68) Additionally, two  other  studies  within the same SR  found 
traumatic onset of pain had low sensitivity (48% – 54%) and specificity (47% – 50%) for detection of 
facet joint -mediated LBP, (69, 70) and four studies using Revel’s criteria individually had highly variable 
sensitivity (15% – 100%) and specificity (13% – 86%) for detection of facet joint -mediated LBP. (70-73) 
When Revel’ s criteria were used as a combined criterion, specificity was less variable (66% – 91%) for 
detection of facet joint -mediated LBP.  
Mekhail et al. (2021) reported findings of their prospective diagnostic cohort study in which they used a 
diagnostic sacroiliac joint injection as a reference standard. (63) The Mekhail test, the Patrick test, and the  VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Low Back Pain  
February 2022   Page 33 of 141 Thigh Thrust test had variable sensitivity (53% – 82%) and specificity (27% – 49%) when used separately 
and high sensitivity (89% – 94%) and low specificity (14% – 29%) when used in combination for detection 
of sacroiliac joint -mediated pain. However, a recent SR by Saueressig et al. (2021),  which was not included 
in the systematic evidence review carried out as part of this CPG and did not influence the strength of the 
recommendation , reported that negative predictive value of sacroiliac  joint provocative test cluster is 92% ; 
however,  a positive result from this cluster of tests is only 35% predictive of sacroiliac  joint pain. (74)  
González Espinosa de Los Monteros et al. (2020) reported findings of their prospective diagnostic cohort study in which they used MRI findings as a reference standard for detection of lumbar and lumbosacral 
radiculopathy. (64) In their study, several neurological and nerve root tension tests, including the Straight 
Leg Raise test, the Bragard test, the Fajersztajn test, the Sicard test, the Passive Neck Flexion test, the Kernig test, the Slump test and the Dejerine’s triad, had variable rates (low -to-high) of sensitivity and 
specificity for detection of lumbar and lumbosacral radiculopathy.   
Tawa et al. (2019) reported findings of a retrospective diagnostic cohort study in which they used MRI as a reference standard for detection of lumbar/lumbosacral radiculopathy. (65) Another SR by Tawa et al. 
(2017) reported findings in which the source articles used MRI, CT, surgery, or a combination as the 
reference standard for  detection of lumbar/lumbosacral radiculopathy. (66) These studies reported that 
findings of neurological examination such as skin sensation, motor strength, tendon reflexes, or a combination of such tests, have acceptable, albeit variable rates of sensitivity and specificity. Further, they 
reported negative and positive likelihood ratios  (Self-Reported Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic 
Symptoms and Signs [S- LANSS] score  LR+: 1.87, -LR: 2.4; sensation LR+: 1.66, LR -: 1.37; strength LR +: 1.8, 
LR-: 1.76; reflexes LR+: 4, LR -: 1.8; Lowe limb neuro -dynamic tests [ LLNDTs ] LR+: 1.84, LR -: 2.71) that  are 
likely  to have utility in the clinical diagnosis of lumbar/lumbosacral radiculopathy .  
Evidence thus indicates some benefits of performing these physical examination tests and maneuvers , 
which slightly outweigh the burden and harms associated with performing them .(62-66). However, due to 
high variability in the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity in the body of literature examined as a who le, 
the Work Group decided upon a  Neither for nor against recommendation.  
There is some variability in patient preferences regarding this diagnostic approach. The patient focus 
group expressed frustration with lack of early evaluation (especially use of MRIs) for determining the cause of their LBP, but they also valued the use of a shared decision making approach in which the provider listened to their problems,  carefully considered the underlying causes of their condition, and 
developed an individualized plan for their management. Performing several of these diagnostic physical examinations and provocative tests can seem burdensome because it requires additional  time during 
clinical encounters, but  it can also be reassuring to the patient. In the referenced studies, these tests, 
especially the special provocative tests, were performed by trained clinicians.  However, the Work Group 
acknowledge s that most of these tests may not be commonly performed in primary care settings and 
may require additional training for primary care clinicians to perform them reliably. Unfortunately, there 
is no evidence to support the type and amount of training required, or how such trai ning may improve 
the reliability of these tests.
 If a healthcare facility has few providers with adequate training, this may 
limit patient access to this diagnostic approach. Performing provocative testing to elicit pain in patients 
who are seeking medical  attention for their LBP may not be universally well accepted. Performing  VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Low Back Pain

clinical encounters performed virtually.  
The Work Group systematically reviewe d evidence related to this recommendation. (62-66) Therefore, 
this is a Reviewed, New -added recommendation. The Work Group’s confidence in the quality of the 
evidence was very low. The body of evidence had some limitations including not all patients received a 
diagnostic reference standard, a disputable reference standard (e.g., MRI for diagnosi s of 
radiculopathy) , or the same diagnostic reference standard. Further, most studies did not report whether 
interpretation of the reference test was blinded to imaging findings. (62) The potential benefits of 
performing relevant physical examination tests (e.g., neurological examination of skin sensation, motor 
strength, tendon reflex testing ; special provocative testing such as the S traight Leg Raise  or Bragard  
tests for detection of lumbar/lumbosacral radiculopathy; Revel’s criteria for detection of facet joint -
mediated LBP ) slightly outweighed the potential harm of additional time burden to the clini cian or 
temporary exacerbation of patients’ pain. However, the Work Group was concerned about the potential 
of this recommendation to result in unintended consequences of increased healthcare utilization such 
as diagnostic testing , and its unclear impact on patient management and outcomes. Patient values and 
preferences varied somewhat  because  some patients prefer early diagnostic imaging, but others prefer 
their clinician carefully evaluate them for underlying causes of their clinical condition. Thus, the Work 
Group decided upon a Neither for nor against  recommendation.

Discussion  
Proponents of the biopsychosocial model of pain have supported a variety of structured education programs to treat LBP . Pain psychology and pain neuroscience education are pillars of these programs, but 
considerable differences in strategies and delivery methods warrant individual consideration of the evidence base for each education program captured in this review . Evidence for back school, clinician -
directed education with patient -led goal setting, and pain neuroscience education (PNE) was considered.  
An SR and meta -analysis by Straube et al. (2016) cited in the 2017 VA/DoD LBP CPG suggested no clinically 
meaningful benefit for intermediate and long -term pain, disability, and QoL with back school compared to 
no treatment. (75) More recent evidence aligns with these findings. When compared to no treatment or 
“standard medical care,” a Cochrane review and meta -analysis by Parreira et al. (2017) found back school 
conferred no statistically significant difference in pain at three months or beyond. A lthough a statistically 
significant difference in disability was seen at 3 – 6 months, the magnitude was not considered clinically

Disability Questionnaire [R MDQ] and Oswestry Disability Index [ODI]). (76) Other  outcomes  of interest , 
such as QoL, kinesiophobia, and catastrophization, were not reported in constituent studies of the review. 
In summary, evidence for back school has not established benefit on patient -centered outcomes. 
However, the quality of evidence was very low and further research is likely needed . 
Sparse evidence suggests  the possibility of  a small  benefit from clinician -directed education with patient -
led goal setting. A single RCT (n=75)  was captured in our systematic evidence review and resulted in 
improve d critical outcomes such as QoL (36-Item Short Form Surveyh [SF-36] MD : 19.5; minimum clinically 
important difference [ MCID ]: 10 points) ,(77) and pain (numeric rating scale [NRS] MD : 2.3; MCID : 2 
points) ,(78) both of whi ch achieved clinical relevan ce. Clinically significant changes were also seen in 
important outcomes , such as self -efficacy and kinesiophobia. Further, improvements in intermediate and 
long -term disability were seen despite falling short of clinical significance ( Quebec Back Pain Disability 
Scale [ QBDS ] MD: 12.9; MCID: 20 points ).(78, 79) Although these results could be viewed as promising, 
they are based on a single, small clinical trial uncorroborated by subsequent investigation. Additional studies with larger patient populations and similar findings would improve confidence in these results.  
An SR  and meta -analysis by Wood et al. (201 9) was unable to demonstrate important benefits with PNE 
alone or combined with other interventions such as PT.( 80) Based on this review, evidence for 
intermediate and long -term data is scant and shows no statistically significant benefit in long -term 
function or pain. Functional benefit was seen in the short -term (RMDQ MD : 3.94 at mean 32 days ; MCID : 5 
points );(78) however, the benefit did not achieve clinical significance and the follow -up period fell short of  
the Work Group’s pre -specified 12 week  threshold for the systematic evidence review. Ancillary evidence 
published after the Wood et al. (2018) review suggests benefit at three months  for important, patient -
centered outcomes such as pain catastrophizing and kinesiophobia ( PCSi MD: 10.6; MCID: 5.2; TSK MD: 
8.5; MCID: 4). (81) However, this  is based on a single, small RCT  (n=65) .(82) Hence , additional  studies with 
large patient populations are needed. Overall, the evidence base for PNE mirrors that of back school, with 
no demonstrable benefit and very low quality evidence. Consequently, in both cases, further research is 
likely to have significant impact on management recommendations.  
Patient preferences for structured education- based methods are likely to vary considerably.  Some p atients 
generally prefer pharmacotherapeutic strategies  while others place greater value on education or other 
non-pharmacologic interventions. Additionally,  the time -intensive nature of structured education 
programs could be repellent or prohibitive for some patients , while others will find the time well- spent if a 
better understanding of their condition enables them to better self -manage their symptoms . Resource 
utilization and acceptability could be problematic in some practice settings, stemming from time costs 
incurred by providers for both training and im plementation.

inconsistency, imprecision, and small sample sizes. (76, 79) The benefits of structured, education- based 
programs on outcomes such as disability, QoL, pain, kinesiophobia, and pain catastrophization slightly outweighed the potential harms for some programs, but not others. Additionally,  the clinical significance 
of these effects is disputable  in some cases , and most of the evidence showed no intermediate or long -

Recommendation  
7.For the self -management of low back pain, there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or
against technology- based modalities.j
(Ne
ither for nor against  | Reviewed, N ew-added)
Discussion  
The systematic evidence review identified four studies examining the use of technology- based modalities 
(mobile health [m Health ], online/web- based applications, Nintendo Wii, phone applications, and 
telephone -based) compared with usual  care in patients with LBP. (84-87) Du et al. (2020) reported that the 
number of eligible studies was small, and the  authors  did not compare the effects of e- Health based on 
self-management program with traditional face -to-face self -management because very few studies were 
available. (86) E- Health is the delivery of health resources via traditional internet which is called web 
health, and the other form of e -Health is the dissemination of health information using personal mobile 
phones which is known as m -Health. Amorim et al. (2019) reported that one potential limitation was that 
the interventions included several pragmatically delivered components such as he alth coaching activity 
trackers and mobile technology (IMPACT App). (84) There also was no follow -up contact with the control 
group except for weekly surveys sent via mobile text or email.  An SR by Dario et al. (2017) was limited to a 
small number of trials, and there was variability in design, contact, populations investigated, and measurement of outcomes. (85) The study’s quantitative synthesis was limited to the outcomes of pain and 
disability. Suman et al. (2019) suggested that the study must be interpreted with caution because loss -to-
follow -up rate was higher for the intervention group than the control group. (87) Most participants in the 
study did not need or use the intervention and had minimal disability and impaired QoL before  the start of 
the study. The  overall quality of the evidence for most of the outcomes assessed was rated low to  very 
low, primarily due to limitations in the methodological quality of the studies reviewed. (84-87) 
There is some variability  in patient preferences regarding the use of technology -based modalities. For 
working patients, taking time off for appointments may be difficult. Therefore, some patients  may value a 
technology -based option that would allow them to avoid traveling to receive care. There is a suggestion

patient s may face travel difficulty ( e.g., traffic/lack of transportation) wherever they live , and therapist 
capacity is less than potential demand in most places. Stigma is another reason patients may prefer 
technology -based treatment. Further, there may be a lack of internet access in rural areas, and costs 
associated with internet and technology equipment need to be taken into consideration.  
The Work Group systematically reviewed evidence related to this recommendation. (84-87) Therefore, this 
is a Reviewed, New -added recommendation. The Work Group’s confidence in the quality of the evidence 
was very low. The body of evidence had some limitations including failure to differentiate between 
telehealth modalities (hybrid study applications and web- based items grouped under telehealth).  Study 
limitations included  lack of intent ion to treat ( ITT) analysis ,(85) unclear blinding status ,(85) and a high 
and/or differential attrition rate. (87) In general, the benefits of using technology -based modalities for self -
management were balanced with any potential harm, as there were no direct harms associated with the self-management interventions, but costs and infrastructure are burdens worth considering.  However, 
some studies demonstrated marginal improvements in functional status and pain severity in the short -
term, for which the Work Group felt the benefits slightly outweighed the potential harms/burden. (85, 86) 
There was a lack of data demonstrating long -term efficacy. Patient values and preferences were somewhat 
varied because some patients may not prefer technology- based modalities. Younger patients may be more 
inclined to adopt such technological tools. Some patients may value not having to travel to medical 
facilities. Thus, the Work Group decided upon a Neither for nor against  recommendation.  
C.Non-pharmacologic and Non -invasive Therapy
Recommendation
8.For patients with chronic low back pain, we  suggest  cognitive behavioral therapy.
(Weak for  | Reviewed, New -replaced )
Discussion  
As the importance of viewing chronic LBP from a biopsychosocial model has increased, there has been a rise in use of behavioral interventions to assist patients with non- pharmacologic self -management.  
Evidence suggests that CBT was more effective than usual care in  improv ing the critical outcome of 
functional status ,
 with moderate confidence in the quality of the evidence .(88, 89) CBT was associated 
with small im provements in the important outcome of pain. (89) The current body of research on 
behavioral interventions includes many variations and types of treatment. The intervention can be 
provided in an individual or group setting with a variable number  of sessions and is typically provided by a 
behavioral health provider. In the studies of CBT for back pain the number of visits usually consisted of 
4 – 12 visits . The content o f visits typically follow ed a manual and includes a structured agenda for the visit 
as well as between -visit assignments. Some topics include  identifying maladaptive cognitions such as 
catastrophizing and developing ways to reframe these into more adaptive cognitions. Techniques such as 
relaxation, behavioral activation, and exposure are commonly used to reduce the functional impact of pain 
as well as improve QoL. (89) One of the areas for future research is the effectiveness of CBT interventions 
specifically designed to address pain such as cognitive behavioral therapy for chronic pain (CBT -CP). 
No studies that addressed other behavioral interventions (e.g., A cceptance and C ommitment Therapy 
[ACT], biofeedback ) met criteria for inclusion in the current systematic evidence review . Based on low   VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Low Back Pain  
February 2022   Page 38 of 141 quality evidence, alternative behavioral interventions that include var iations of CBT (e.g., fear-avoidance 
exposure,  cognitive patient education, combined neuromuscular exercise , cognitive behavioral back care 
counseling ) demonstrated no difference in QoL  compared to  no treatment. (90-92) There was no 
difference in functional status found between Mood GYM,  which is a CBT -based intervention with five self -
help modules combined with standard physical treatment, and standard physical treatment alone. (93) 
There was no evidence identified  for acute LBP  interventions .  
An important component of the biopsychoso cial model and selection of any intervention is consideration 
of patient values and preferences. The following factors are important to consider when collaborating with 
a patient to determine if CBT is an appropriate part of the treatment plan. CBT can be time -intensive , and 
patients may not want, or have the ability,  to dedicate the amount of time  necessary to the intervention . 
Additionally, the specialized training of a behavioral health provider is an important consideration and may 
decrease availability and feasibility at all facilities and locations.  However, the VHA is committed to trainin g 
providers across the healthcare system in evidenced based treatment to reduce the negative impacts of chronic pain. CBT -CP is readily accessible to most  Veterans , decreasing this barrier and demonstrating a 
strength of the VA . On the other hand, some patients prefer treatments with minimal risk such as CBT 
(versus potential risks with medications, procedures, etc.) where they can  acquire self -managed skills and 
strategies for pain. Approaches such as CBT may be used in isolation or in conjunction with 
pharmacotherapy and therefore may also be of interest as an additional component of the treatment plan.  
The Work Group systematically reviewed evidence related to this recommendation ( 89-93) and considered 
the assessment of the evidence put forth in the 2017 VA/DoD LBP CPG. (88) Therefore, this is a Reviewed, 
New -replaced recommendation. The Work Group’s confidence in the quality of the evidence was low . The 
body of evidence had some limitations including unclear randomization, high attrition, deviations from the intended interventions and inability to effectively blind patients and providers. (89) The potential benefits 
of CBT ( e.g., improved functioning and decreased pain severity ) continue to outweigh the potential harm 
(e.g., data on harm was limited but none of the reviewed evidence on CBT suggested serious harm risk.) 
However, the strength of the recommendation was modified from Strong for  in the 2017 VA/DoD LBP CPG 
to Weak for  in this updated CPG based on the inability to determine if the critical outcome of QoL is 
improved with CBT. Patient values and preferences were somewhat varied because time burden was a 
barrier for decreased acceptance of behavioral interventions. Thus, the Work Group decided upon a Weak for recommendation.  
Recommendation

Evidence suggests clinician -directed exercise improves pain, disability, and physical functioning in patients 
with LBP. Structured, clinician- directed exercise programs are those involving organized and progressive 
k  Recommendations for “patients with low back pain” encompass patient populations with acute, subacute, or chronic LBP with

February 2022   Page 39 of 141 activity prescribed by a clinician to improve pain, disability, and physical function. This include s exercise 
programs targeted at the lumbar, abdominal, and hip muscles (often referred to as the “ core ”) and 
generalized exercises not specifically targeting the back (e.g., aerobic training on a bicycle, walking, or arm 
and leg muscle strengthening exercises using weight machines ).  
The Work Group found evidence supporting a wide variety of exercise programs including aerobic, (94) 
aquatic (pool), (95) mechanical diagnosis and therapy (MDT), (96) mobility, (97-99) motor control, (100- 106) 
Pilates, (107- 110) strength training, (105) structured walking programs, (111, 112) and tai chi. (113- 115) 
Most of the evidence concerned patients with chronic LBP , but the Work Group did review some evidence 
on acute LBP.(96, 116) These recommendations were based on a large body of evidence from the 2017 
VA/DoD LBP CPG ( 107, 108, 111, 113, 114) and several SRs ( 94-96, 100, 101, 112, 115) and RCTs ( 97-99, 
102- 106, 109, 110, 117- 119) reviewed for this update. Most, but not all,  of the studies reviewed for 
clinician -directed exercise used physical therapists as the treating clinician but the panel reviewed no 
evidence comparing the efficacy of exercise therapy delivered by different professional groups.  
The effect sizes of th ese interventions on pain, disability, and physical function are  generally small to 
moderate , with individual studies often showing statistically significant and clinically meaningful changes in 
some outcomes but not others. There was no evidence  showing clear superiority of any of these 
approaches when compared to another in improving pain, disability, or physical functioning . The Work 
Group found limited and inconsistent evidence favoring supervised v ersu s home -based exercise 
sessions. (105, 106, 120)  
While some studies found no differences between structured exercise programs and a credible placebo 
intervention, most studies found small to moderate effects in the short to medium term on pain, disabi lity, 
and physical functioning that were statistically significant and clinically meaningful.  Few studies monitored 
adverse events (AE), and such AEs are typically self -limited temporary exacerbations of pain or symptoms . 
Representative examples  include  reporting of mild musculoskeletal complaints such as pai n or soreness 
both in the back and in other body regions, and other AEs (to include systemic disease and 
emotional/psychosocial events) that were not thought to be related to participation in the exercise 
program .(98-100) These structured exer cise programs are generally safe and well -tolerated by patients. 
However,  there was significant heterogeneity in the studies evaluated, many studies lacked blinding ( even 
of outcome assessors ), and many failed to conduct an ITT analysis.  
While effects are generally small to moderate  and clinically meaningful, there is a burden of ongoing 
participation in the exercise program, either in a clinical setting (which also involves travel) or 
independently. The Work Group e stimate d large variation in the values and preferences of patients toward 
different modes or types of exercise and their ability or interest to participate. There are also resource considerations, including having an adequate supply of trained clinicians to deliver these programs, having 
the appropriate equipment needed for some of the options (e.g., gym -based aerobic and strength 
machines or a pool for aquatic exercise), or having a safe outdoor or indoor space to exercise. Some programs require more vigorous exercise , and some studies were conducted in subpopulations that may 
not be directly comparable to VA/DoD pat ients.

including small sample sizes, lack of blinding (even of outcome assessors), and failure to complete ITT

functioning, and QoL slightly outweighed the potential harm ( AEs were uncommon and mild) and burdens 
(requirement to travel or participate in an ongoing exercise therapy regimen). Patient values and 
preferences vary considerably because many patients have specific values and preferences about the type, 
mode, and duration of exercise they might desire to participate in. Thus, the Work Group decided upon a 
Weak for recommendation.  
Recommendation  
10.For patients with chronic low back pain, we suggest spinal mobilization/manipulation.
(Weak for  | Reviewed, New -replaced )
11.For patients with acute low back pain, there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against
spinal mobilization/manipulation.
(Ne
ither for nor against  | Reviewed, New -replaced )
Discussion  
Evidence suggests spinal mobilization/manipulation results in modest but clinically important reductions in 
pain and disability in patients with chronic LBP. (121- 128) Rubinstein et al. (2019) compared spinal 
manipulative therapy (SMT) to recommended and non- recommended treatments. (128) A treatment was 
considered recommended or non- recommended if it was designated so  in two out of three recent LBP 
guidelines. Treatment with SMT was as effective as other recommended treatments (e.g., exercise, 
nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drugs  [NSAIDs ]) for reducing pain and disability at one, six, and 12 months. 
SMT was superior to non -recommended treatments (e.g., short -wave diathermy, ultrasound, light 
massage, wait list, and electrotherapies) for reduction of disability at one, six, and 12 months but not 
different for reduction of pain severity.  
An SR and meta -analysis by Dal Farra et al. (2021) demonstrated reductions in pain severity (standardized 
mean difference [SMD]: 0.59) and disability (SMD: 0.42) when comparing osteopathy including manipulati ve therapy to control. (121) However, only one study ( 129) included in the meta -analysis tracked 
outcomes to the predetermined target of 12 weeks. Of patients receiving osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT), 65% achieved 30% relief and 50% achieved 50% relief compared to 46% and 35%, 
respectively, in the sham OMT group. (121) Marti -Salvador et al. (2018) compared OMT with manual 
therapy targeted at the diaphragm to OMT with a sham diaphragm  intervention.( 122) OMT with 
diaphragm intervention was superior, but both groups achieved clinically important changes in pain and function. Several studies used to substantiate the recommendation in the 2017 VA/DoD LBP CPG 
demonstrated similar effects to those reported by Rubinstein et al. (2019). (123- 127) Evidence for OMT and 
SMT were considered together because the treatment modalities are similar, and there was variability in 
the type of clinician (e.g., Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine  [DO], Doctor of Chiropractic  [DC], Doctor of 
Physical Therapy  [DPT]) performing manipulation in both groups.   VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Low Back Pain  
February 2022   Page 41 of 141 For acute LBP, the recommendation strength was modified from Weak for  in the 2017 VA/DoD LBP CPG to 
Neither for nor against  in this updated CPG based on limited evidence at or beyond the Work Group’s 
predetermined target of 12 weeks.  Of the 20 studies included in an SR and meta -analysis by Rubinstein et 
al. (2013), only two assessed outcomes at 12 week s. One study demonstrated clinically important changes 
in pain and disability when compared to baseline but not when compared to PT. Importantly, this study 
included patients with neck and LBP, and the Work Group was unable to assess the effect of SMT on LBP 
alone. Another study reported positive effects for SMT, physiotherapy, and education for pain and 
disability, but differences between groups were not statistically significant. (130) Similar to exercise, the 
use of spinal mobilization/manipulation is a relatively low -risk intervention for patients with LBP. Though 
AEs were not systematically captured in this  review, Rubinstein et al. (2013) found AEs,  like soreness , to be 
common but mild and self -limited. (130)  
There is some variability in patient preferences regarding this treatment. Courses of SMT vary in length but on average require a significant time commitment for patient s and provider s. SMT is likely to be available 
to most patients , as DCs, DOs,  and DPTs  receive training in the modality.  
The Work Group systematically reviewed evidence related to Recommendation 1 0 (121, 122, 128, 131) 
and considered the assessment of the evidence put forth in the 2017 VA/DoD LBP CPG. (123- 127) 
Therefore, this is a Reviewed, New -replaced recommendation. The Work Group’s confidence in the 
quality of the evidence was low. The body of evidence had some limitations including limited duration of follow -up and difficulty inherent to performing sham manipulations. (121, 122, 128) The benefits of 
spinal manipulation, including modest improvements in pain and function at or exceeding 12 weeks, slightly outweighed the potential harm of AEs, which was small . Patient values and preferences varied  
somewhat because  some patients may be less tolerant of the hands -on nature of manual therapies or 
the time required to complete a course of treatment. Thus, the Work Group decided upon a Weak for  
recommendation . 
The Work Group systematically reviewed evidence related to Recommendation 1 1; howeve r, no studies in 
the patient population with acute LBP met inclusion criteria . The Work Group also considered the 
assessment of the evidence put forth in the 2017 VA/DoD LBP CPG. (130, 132) Therefore, this is a

12.For patients with chronic low back pain, there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against
mindfulness -based stress reduction.
(Neither for nor against  | Reviewed, New -replaced )
Discussion  
Mindfulness -based stress reduction (MBSR) is a structured intervention focused on the concept of 
mindfulness (i.e., being in the present moment, without judgment). Treatment is manualized and includes components such as education, meditative practices, simple yoga poses over eight 2.5 hour group sessions 
plus a longer retreat, and daily home practice. (88) MBSR requires an instructor with specialized MBSR 
training and experience.  
The current systematic evidence review  identified two SRs ( 89, 133) that examined whether MBSR is 
helpful for patients with chronic LBP. Skelly et al. (2020) included five trials of MBSR and was low 
quality. (89) Three of the trials had treatments closely modeled on the program created by Kabat -Zinn 
while the other two trials had some adaptations. Notably, all trials included a main intervention of 1.5 – 2 hour weekly group sessions for eight weeks. Results suggested no differences in functional status or  
pain reduction in the short - or long -term when comparing  MBSR to usual care/attention control. One of 
the trials reported a small reduction in pain ( -0.75 on a 0 – 10 scale;  95% confidence interval [ CI]: -1.29 
to -0.34) at inte rmediate duration follow -up. Skelly et al. (2020) also reported mixed results regarding QoL 
using the SF -2 and SF -36 with three studies finding no difference between MBSR and usual care/attention 
control and two studies finding some short -term benefit for MBSR in the physical component and mental 
component scores of the SF -36.(89) Concerning  other potential benefits of MBSR, one trial indicat ed 
patients  self-reported using less pain medication for LBP at a short -term interval, but not at long -term. 
Finally, one trial suggested a statistical improvement in a measure of depressive symptoms (0.63 points on the PHQ -8), but this did not reach the t hreshold of clinical significance.  
An SR of nine RCTs (n=959)  from Bahnamiri et al. ( 2020) examined the effectiveness of mindfulness -based 
interventions (MBIs) on reducing pain for patients with LBP .(133) The authors concluded that MBIs are 
effective and as effective as CBT at reducing pain intensity. Five of the nine individual  trials identified in the 
SR were consistent with MBSR and showed some evidence of pain reduction; however, these were very 
low quality evidence and there was no statistical analysis of the pooled data. The remaining four trials  
included in the SR combined elements of cognitive or CBT -based treatments with MBSR, which made it 
difficult to evaluate the overall effectiveness  of MBSR.  
There is some variability in patient preferences regarding MBSR treatment. Some patients may be less 
open to mindfulness -based approaches. This treatment is considered time -intensive. There is also 
specialized training needed to facilitate the treatment. This treatment may not be available in all facilities 
and therefore not available to all patients. However, from a staffing standpoint, training can be completed 
and treatment can be facilitated by non- mental health staff. This contrasts with CBT , which  requires 
providers with mental health training. Another consideration is that one trial in the Skelly et al. (2020)  SR 
found 29% of patients e xperienced a brief increase in pain. (89) Overall, the Work Group determined  the 
burdens of MBSR were balanced with potential benefits.   VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Low Back Pain  
February 2022   Page 43 of 141 The Work Group systematically reviewed evidence related to this recommendation ( 89, 133) and 
considered the assessment of the evidence put forth in the 2017 VA/DoD LBP CPG. (88) Therefore, this is a 
Reviewed , New -replaced recommendation. MBSR appears to have no benefit for improved functioning and 
mixed findings for pain and QoL. As noted by Bahnamiri et al. (2020), pain relief is not a primary treatment 
outcome for MBIs. Thus, the Work Group decided there was insufficient evidence to recommend for or 
against MBSR as a treatment for patients with chronic LBP. The Work Group’s confidence in the quality of the evidence was low. The body of evidence had limitations including serious risk of study bias and very 
serious imprecision of findings. (89, 133) The harms of MBSR for chronic LBP  are balanced with the 
potential benefits (e.g., one study found a brief increase in pain, resource intensive treatment). Patient values and preferences varied  somewhat because  some patients may not be open to mindfulness -based 
treatments , and there is a time and resource burden in implementing this treatment. Thus, the Work 
Group decided upon a Neither for nor against  recommendation.  
Recommend ation  
13. For patients with low back pain, there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against lumbar supports.
l  
(Neither for nor against  | Reviewed, Amended ) 
Discussion  
The available evidence is insufficient to recommend for or against the use of lumbar supports in patients with LBP.(134) A meta -analysis of three studies by Gignoux et al. (2020) found the use of lumbar supports 
resulted in a small, statistically insignificant effect on pain severity (SMD : -0.29). (134) The same meta -
analysis reported a medium effect on function (SMD : -0.54); however, of the four studies reporting on 
function, two were disproportionately responsible for the effect and neither reported on outcomes at or 
beyond the Work Group’s  predetermined target of 12 weeks. (134) The recommendatio n in the 2017 
VA/DoD LBP CPG was informed by a comparative effectiveness review by Chou et al. (2016), (113) which 
included three low quality RCTs. (135- 137) This evidence suggest s that lumbar supports were no more 
effective than inactive treatments or no treatment and that lumbar supports did not seem to augment the positive effect of an exercise program. (113) A n RCT by Sato et al. (2012) found that  using lumbar support 
for chronic LBP improve d pain and increase d muscle endurance in the short -term. (135) Paravertebral 
muscle fatigue was not increased by long -term use for chronic LBP, and weakening of the paravertebral 
muscles was not observed up to six months after the start of corset wear. (113, 135) No harms were 
associated with the use of lumbar supports, though harms  were generally not well -reported. (134)  
There is some variability in patient preferences regarding this treatment. Use  of a lumbar support may be 
problematic for Service Members who adhere to dress codes. Although lumbar supports can be rel atively 
inexpensive, LBP is ubiquitous, and even small expenses multiplied by many patients can result in a 
substantial cost. Further, some patients may seek custom lumbar supports , which can be expensive.  
The Work Group systematically reviewed evidence r elated to this recommendation ( 134) and considered 
the assessment of the ev idence put forth in the 2017 VA/DoD LBP CPG. (113) Therefore,  this is a Reviewed, 
Amended recommendation. The Work Group’s confidence in the quality of the evidence was very low. The 
 
l  Recommendations for “patients with low back pain” encompass patient populations with acute, subacute, or chronic LBP with 
or wi thout neurological symptoms.   VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Low Back Pain  
February 2022   Page 44 of 141 body of evidence had some limitations including limited duration of follow -up and heterogeneity in terms 
of the type of lumbar support  used and frequency and duration of use. (113, 134) The benefits of lumbar 
supports for reduction of pain severity and improvement in function slightly outweighed the potential 
harm/burdens. Patient values and preferences varied somewhat because  use of a lumbar support may be 
problematic for Service Members who adhere to dress codes. Further, widespread use may result in substantial costs. Thus, the Work Group decided upon a Neither for nor against  recommendation.  
Recommendation  
14.For patients with low back pain, with or without radicular symptoms, there is insufficient evidence
to recommend for or against mechanical  lumbar traction .
(Neither for nor against  | Reviewed, New -replaced )
Discussion  
The available evidence is insufficient to recommend for or against the use of mechanical traction for 
patients with LBP with or without  radicular symptoms .(138-141) An SR and meta -analysis of seven studies 
by Cheng et al. (202 0) investigat ed the effect of traction on adults with LBP and herniated lumbar 
disc. (138) Only two of the seven  studies  collected outcomes at or beyond the Work Group’s  
predetermined target of 12 weeks. The first was a small RCT (n=64) demonstrating clinically meaningful improvement in function (O DI: -19.3) but not pain when compared to baseline. The second was a very 
small RCT (n=20) comparing physiotherapy versus physiotherapy plus traction, which found no significant difference between the two interventions.  
Vanti et al. (2021), in an SR of eig ht studies and a meta -analysis of five studies, investigated the effect of 
traction on adults with lumbar radiculopathy. (139) Of eight studies, three reported on outcomes at or 
beyond the Work Group’s  predetermined target of 12 weeks. The studies reported small to moderate 
improvements in pain and function from baseline but were fraught with limitations including very small 
sample sizes and high dropout rates.  
The Cochrane review by Wegner et al. (2013 ), which informed the recommendation in the 2017 VA/DoD 
LBP CPG, found that for adults with LBP with or without sciatica, of any duration, traction had little to no 
impact on pain intensity, functional status, or global improvement when compared with sham traction, no 
treatment, other treatments, or when applied as a combination therapy. (140) An RCT by Diab et al. (2012) 
found no significant change in pain when comparing stretching plus infrared radiation to traction plus infrared radiation. (141) AEs were common in the form of aggravations of low back and leg pain and low 
back stiffness. Less common were headache, dizziness, and fatigue. (139, 140)  
There is large variability in patient preferences given the heterogeneity of traction modalities employed and variability of patient tolerance to common AEs. Further, courses of lumbar traction require a 
significant time commitment by providers and patients and expenditures for the healthcare system.  
The Work Group systematically reviewed evidence related to this recommendation  (138, 139) and 
considered the assessment of the evidence put forth in the 2017 VA/DoD LBP CPG. (140, 141) Therefore, 
this is a Reviewed, New -replaced  recommendation. The Work Group’s confidence in the quality of the

were common but mild. Patient values and preferences varied because methods of a pplying  traction were

tolerate  common AEs. Thus, the Work Group decided upon a Neither for nor against  recommendation . 
Recommendation  
15. For patients with chronic low back pain, there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against 
auricular acupressure.  
(Neither for nor against  | Reviewed, New -added) 
Discussion  
Available evidence is insufficient to recommend for or against the use of auricular acupressure for LBP. One SR by Yang et al. (2017) included seven RCTs  (n=369) examining the use of auricular acupressure for 
treatment of chronic LBP. (142) Outcomes included a small positive impact on short -term pain intensity, 
but no change in disability as measured by the RMDQ. Controls varied and included exercise (tai chi or 
walking), usual care, and sham (i.e., auricular acupuncture points not expected to improve chronic LBP).   
Yang et al. (2017) found no change in disability at four or 12 weeks. (142) Howe ver, pain intensity was 
statistically significant  at four weeks when compared to sham (five RCTs; MD : -0.89; 95% CI)  and at 
12 weeks (two RCTs; SMD : −0.56; 95% CI : −0.91  to −0.21; p =0.002). (142) This SR was rated as fair, and the 
confidence in the quality of the evidence was low.  
No AEs were reported; however, sensitization to adhesive tape used, soreness at  the treatment sites, and 
sleep disturbance were noted. Benefits slightly outweigh burdens due to the low risk associated with 
auricular acupressure. Burdens of needing to attend treatment and the acceptability of wearing acupressure devices that are visible to others on the ear are additional considerations for the patient. The 
Work Group considered that many patients value small improvements in pain, but the evidence failed to 
show a change in disability.  
The Work Group expect s large variability in patien t preferences regarding this treatment. There are efforts 
to increase the use and acceptability of non- pharmacologic options for pain, and a desire for non-
pharmacologic options was noted by the patient focus group; however, auricular acupuncture is unlike ly to 
be a treatment approach with much familiarity for patients and/or providers. Particularly in the DoD setting, a high degree of skepticism toward CIH approaches may be present.  
At this time, auricular acupressure is not commonly used within the VA and DoD populations.  The Work 
Group also considered lack of standardization of this type of care in the community if acupressure were not available in a medical facility.  
The Work Group systematically reviewed new evidence related to this recommendation. (142) Therefore, 
this is a Reviewed, New -added recommendation.  The Work Group’s confidence in the quality of the 
evidence was low. The body of evidence had some limitations including small sample size, heterogeneity of 
studies, and lack of longer term follow -up (12 weeks and beyond). The benefits of auricular acupres sure 
slightly outweighed the potential harm due to the low risk profile of this treatment. Patient values and  VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Low Back Pain  
February 2022   Page 46 of 141 preferences varied largely because  of a lack of familiarity with this type of treatment and accessibility. 
Thus, the Work Group decided upon a Nei ther for nor against recommendation.  
Recommendation  
16.For patients with low back pain, there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against yoga
or qi gong .m
(Ne
ither for nor against  | Reviewed, New -replaced )
Discussion  
There is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of yoga to improve disability or QoL when compared 
to usual care, wait list, or education in patients with LBP .(143) The Zhu e t al. (2020) SR reported small 
SMD s for disability ; however , these differences were considered not  clinically meaningful. Studies failed to 
show a clinically significant reduction in pain. (143) A 2016 SR evaluated for the 2017 VA/DoD LBP CPG 
suggested yoga was benefi cial for short - and long -term pain ( SMD : -0.48;  95% CI : -0.65 to - 0.31; 
SMD : -0.33; 95% CI : -0.59 to -0.07 respectively ) and disability ( SMD : -0.35; 95% CI : -0.55 to - 0.15) , but QoL 
improvement was uncertain.( 144) 
When yoga is compared to other exercise interventions (conventional PT  or strength training), no 
significant difference in disability, QoL (physical health or mental health) , or pain was shown. (105, 143) 
Seven studies  from one SR  reported AEs (n=1,266). (143) Mild increased back pain was reported in the yoga 
intervention group, while a mild to moderate increase in back pain was reported among the exercise 
intervention group.  
Available evidence failed to show that qi gong is effective for improving function or reducing chronic LBP. 
Nduwinmana et al. (2020) reviewed various mind- body interventions for chronic LBP, including qi 
gong. (145) Three RCTs compared qi gong to walking programs, but due to the heterogeneity of the 
studies, only two trials (n=199) met criteria for the critical outcome of activity limitation. (146-148) 
Although one study exhibited favorable outcomes for short -term improvement of activity limitation for qi 
gong compared to a walking program, the pooled analysis did not show a significant effect. (146,  147) 
Similarly for pain, one study favored qi gong, (148) but the overall analysis of the 242 participants from two 
trials revealed a non -significant effect. (147, 148) 
The quality of evidence was very low, sample sizes were small, and heterogeneity existed among the studies reviewed. Trials did not blind patients, providers,  or assessors. A discussion of AEs  in the systematic 
evidence review was lacking.  
Large variation  exists in patient acceptance of yoga and qi gong as an intervention for LBP. While some 
may be eager to engage in this practice, others may not consider yoga to meet their values and 
preferences. There is a time burden for these practices , and studies showed large variation in frequency 
and duration to achieve benefit. For example, yoga practices studied ranged from seven days (eight hours 
per day) to 24 weeks (two 90- minute classes per week) of intervention. (143) Patients may need to travel 
for classes, and resources would be needed  for instruct or training and class time. Telehealth is an

The Work Group systematically reviewed evidence related to this recommendation ( 105, 143, 145) and 
considered the assessment of the evidence put forth in the 2017 VA/DoD LBP CPG. (144) Therefore, this  is  a 
Reviewed, New -replaced recommendation. The 2017 VA/DoD LBP CPG  suggested yoga as a potential part 
of an exercise program. However, due to the low confidence in the quality of the evidence related to yoga 
as a stand -alone intervention, the lack of evidence of benefit , and expectation of little harm , the Work 
Group included yoga as part of this N either for nor against recommendation  rather than as part of 
Recommendation 9 in this CPG update . Qi gong was not assessed in the 2017 VA/DoD LBP  CPG , and the  
Work Group’s confidence in the quality of the evidence on qi gong was very low . The body of evidence for 
this recommendation had limitations including small sample size, heterogeneity of studies especially 
regarding frequency and duration of intervention, and lack of blinding by assessors. Although resources 
and patient time would be used for these interventions, harms are expec ted to be low. However, if yoga or 
qi gong were used in replacement of another intervention that may be more useful for the LBP patient, delay of appropriate care would be considered a harm. Patient values and preferences vary. Thus, the Work Group decided upon a Neither for nor against recommendation.  
Recommendation  
17. For patients with low back pain, there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against  
cupping, laser therapy, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, and ultrasound.n 
(Neither for n or against  | Reviewed, New -replaced ) 
Discussion  
There is  insufficient evidence  to recommend for or against the use of cupping , laser therapy, 
transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation ( TENS ), and ultrasound for reduction of pain and disability in 
patient s with LBP. (113, 149- 153) Wood et al. (2020) systematically reviewed 21 RCTs assessing the effect 
of cupping on musculoskeletal pai n and range of motion. (149) Of those, only one RCT pertained to LBP and 
reported on outcomes at or beyond the predetermined target of 12 weeks. That study demonstrated a small difference in pain severity ( reduction of 15 points on visual analog scale [VAS] ) and no difference in 
function when comparing cupping plus paracetamol to paracetamol alone.  
The Wang et al. (2017) meta -analysis included six RCTs assessing the effect of cupping for LBP. (150) Of 
those, two reported on outcomes at or beyond the prede termined target of 12 weeks. One reported that 
cupping had a small effect on function (SMD : -0.31) but no clinically meaningful effect on pain, while the 
other reported a large effect on function (SMD : -1.56). Mardani -Kivi et al. (2019) conducted an RCT  
(n=180) and found no difference in pain severity when comparing wet cupping to rest and acetaminophen 
at three months, and a slight difference in favor of wet cupping at six months. (151) Wet cupping resulted 
in a borderline clinically significant effect on disability. (149- 151) Most AEs were mild and self -limiting, 
including soreness and ecchymosis . Several instances of blistering were associated with fire -cupping  for 
knee osteoarthritis  (OA)  but not for LBP.(149)  
 
n  Recommendations for “patients with low back pain” encompass patient populations with acute, subacute, or chronic LBP with 
or without neurological symptoms.   VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Low Back Pain  
February 2022   Page 48 of 141 The Glazov et al. (2016) meta -analysis included 15  RCTs comparing low -level laser therapy to sham or 
other treatments for adults with LBP. (152) Of 15 studies, four reported on outcomes at or beyond the 
predetermined target of 12 weeks. When comparing laser plus exercise, sham laser plus exercise, and 
laser alone, all groups achieved clinically meaningful improvements in pain and disability  at 12 weeks; 
however, no difference was found between groups. Comparison of “high dose,” “low dose,” and sham laser resulted in no clinically meaningful difference in pain or function from baseline or between groups 
at six months. The two remaining studie s favored sham laser over laser for pain reduction at 12 weeks 
and six months. (152)  
The systematic evidence review did not identify new data on the effect of TENS for LBP. The 2017 VA/DoD 
LBP CPG recommendation was informed by an RCT by Buchmuller et al. (2012), which found no statistical 
difference between TENS and sham TENS for pain or function at six weeks. (153)  
The systematic evidence review did not identify new data on the effect of ultrasound for LBP. The 
2017 VA/DoD LBP CPG recommendation was informed by a comparative effectiveness review by 
Chou  et al. (2016) which found low quality evidence that ultrasound was no  more effective than sham 
ultrasound or no difference in outcomes when comparing ultrasound to sham ultrasound. (113)  
There is likely to be large variability in patient preference s for cupping. The focus group participants 
expressed a desire for CIH  treatments, specifically non -pharmacologic treatment, and shared decision 
making. However, cupping techniques vary with some versions including bloodletting or use of an open flame to create suction, which may be unfamiliar to patients and clinicians. Patients may also be averse to 
the skin markings common after cupping.  Completing a course of treatment may require a significant time 
commitment and travel burden for patient s. Clinician time and training should also be considered.  
There is likely high variability in patient preference s for laser therapy, TENS, and ultrasound. Laser therapy 
and ultrasound are usually provided by a clinician, which introduces a time and travel burden. TENS is 
usually self -administered but application of the electrode pads can be difficult for  some  patients. Cost to 
the healthcare system must also be considered as these modalities requires specialized equipment.  
The Work Group systematically reviewed evidence related to this recommendation ( 149- 152) and 
considered the assessment of the evidence put forth in the 2017 VA/DoD LBP CPG. (113, 153) Therefore, 
this is a Reviewed, New -replaced  recommendation. The Work Group’s confidence in the quality of the 
evidence was low. The body of evidence had some limitations including small sample sizes, heterogeneity 
for the a pplications of modalities, and limited follow -up duration. (149- 152) The benefits of cupping, laser 
therapy, TENS, and ultrasound were balanced with the potential harm of AE s, which were generally mild 
and self -limiting. Patient values and preferences var y because tolerance  to AEs, time and travel burden, 
and lack of familiarity with the modality  likely vary between patients. Thus, the Work Group decided upon 
a Neither for nor against  recommendation.   VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Low Back Pain

Recommendation
18.For patients with chronic low back pain, we suggest  duloxetine.
(Weak for | Reviewed, New -replaced )
Discussion  
The evidence review identified one SR by Kolber et al. (2021) ,(154) which included four RCTs comparing 
duloxetine versus placebo, (155- 158) and found that  duloxetine (n=832) provided a clinically relevant 
improvement in pain, defined as a &gt;30% reduction in pain compared to baseline . The analysis revealed 
58% of patients receiving duloxetine (n=832) and 47% of patients receiving placebo (n=667) had clinically 
significant pain relief (risk ratio [ RR]: 1. 25; 95% CI: 1.13 to 1.38, p&lt;0.00001). The benefit of duloxetine for 
chronic LBP for pain and function is demonstrated by moderate  quality evidence. (154) However, the 
amount of pain reduction over placebo was not consistently clinically meaningful as duloxetine resulted in 
0.46 to 0.82 points less than placebo on a 10 point scale in two of the studies reviewed in  the Kolber  et al. 
(2021) .(155, 158) 
When function was measured by the RMDQ, the comparative data were inconclusive. (113) It is also 
important to keep in mind that the effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) on LBP are inconclusive. (113) Of the serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor s (SNRI) class, only  studies on 
duloxetine  met criteria for inclusion for the evidence review . Theoretically, the SNRI class may 
demonstrate some benefit given a similar mechanism of action to duloxetine.  
Within the studies reviewed in the Kolber SR,  there was a high rate of discontinuation due to AEs for those 
in the duloxetine arms compared with the placebo arms. Within three of the four studies that documented 
study dropout rates, the discontinuation rate due to AEs versus  placebo was: 15.2% v ersus  5.4% (p=0.002) 
for duloxetine 60  mg,(157) 13.9% versus  5.8% (p=0.047) for d uloxetine 120  mg,( 158) and 24.1% vs. 8.5% 
for duloxetine 120  mg.(156) While there were no serious AEs  found in the evidence review, there  are more 
adverse effects associa ted with duloxetine when compared to placebo. These  include nausea, insomnia, 
dry mouth, constipation, somnolence , fatigue , and hyperhi drosis .(113) Duloxetine also has sexual side 
effects that may diminish treatment acceptability and adherence. Additionally , duloxetine has a risk of 
hepatotoxicity and should not be used in patients with substantial alcohol use or evidence of chronic liver 
disease. Combining duloxetine with other serotonergic medications increases the risk of serotonin 
syndrome and should be used with caution. There is a black box warning with antidepressants, including 
duloxetine, in the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders for increased risk of suicidal thinking and behavior in children, adolescents, and young adults. (159)  
There is large variation in patient preferences regarding this treatment. Some patients may prefer to take a 
medication for their LBP , while others may have difficulty accepting duloxetine for treatment due to the 
stigma associated with taking  an antidepressant  and the side effects mentioned above. This medication 
may be preferred in patients with depression or anxiety as duloxetine is U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for these conditions, in addition to fibromyalgia.  
The Work Group systematically reviewed evidence related to this recommendation ( 154) and considered 
the assessment of the evidence put forth in the 2017 VA/DoD LBP CPG. (113) The RCTs included in  VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Low Back Pain  
February 2022   Page 50 of 141 Kolber  et al. (2021) were  also covered  in the 2017 VA/DoD LBP CPG ’s systematic evidence review ; thus, 
there was no new evidence  considered in this CPG update . Therefore, this is a Reviewed, New -replaced  
recommendation. The Work Group’s confidence in the quality of the evidence was moderate. The body of 
evidence significant  limitations including  a high rate of  attrition  due to non- serious AEs.(154) The Work 
Group determined t he small but statistically significant benefits of improved pain and function slightly 
outweigh ed the potential harm of AE s, which were mild and not serious. Patient values and preferences 
varied because  of stigma due to antidepressants and preferences regarding whether to take medication. 
Thus , the Work Group decided upon a Weak  for recommendation.

(Weak for  | Reviewed, New -replaced )  
Discussion  
Two SRs and one RCT assessed the potential benefits of NSAIDs compared to placebo. (113, 154, 160) 
Moderate quality evidence from one SR by Kolber et al. (2021) suggests  use of  NSAIDs (n=993) in patients 
with chronic LBP  is associated with an improvement in pain and function, defined as a 30% reduction in 
pain or com bination of pain reduction and functional improvement, compared with placebo (n=644) , with 
a number needed to treat ( NNT ) of 6.(154) Follow-up ranged from 4 – 16 weeks. Low quality evidence 
found no difference between NSAIDs (n=383) and placebo (n=271) at 12 weeks or greater. (154)  
Low quality evidence from the Kolber et al. (2021) SR demonstrated no  significant  difference in AE s 
between placebo and NSAIDs with a follow -up duration of 4 – 12 weeks. (154) The Chou et al. (2016) SR 
included five studies that compared  cyclooxygenase -2 (COX-2) NSAIDs with traditional NSAIDs .(113) N o 
statistically significant difference for pain relie f for acute LBP was seen in four studies. The  fifth study 
found no differences in pain relief between COX -2 and traditional NSAIDs for chronic LBP. (161) 
Most comparative trials between NSAIDs showed no  significant  differences in pain relief. A large  
noninferiority trial randomized 24,081 patients to receive celecoxib, naproxen, or ibuprofen and found the 
cardiovascular (CV) risk  associated with celecoxib was noninferior to the  non-selective NSAIDs. (162) This 
trial was limited by high rates of drug discontinuation (68.8%), study dropout (27.4%), and the restrictions 
on the doses of celecoxib. Most patients in the trial (90%)  had OA. The dose of celecoxib was limited to  
200 mg/day in this group, but dose escalation was allowed for ibuprofen and naproxen.  
All NSAIDs have a black box warning for increased risk of CV events and gastrointestinal (GI) events, and 
these safety issues continue to be high priority when choosing an NSAID. (163) If an NSAID is required in 
a patient with CV risk, naproxen may be a viable option. (164, 165) Providers should consider other 
patient risk factors, primarily GI toxicity, when determining whether relatively COX -2 selective NSAIDs 
should be used over non- selective NSAIDs. The use of relatively  selective  COX- 2 inhibitors reduces the 
risk for GI events; however, this benefit is negated if the patient is using aspirin. (164) NSAIDs can also 
exacerbate heart failure and worsen hypertension and renal function. NSAIDs must be used cautiously 
or avoided in patients with renal impairment or in elderly patients, as these agents may increase serum

possible to reduce CV, GI , and renal AEs. 
The Work Group systematically reviewed evidence related to this recommendation ( 154)  and considered 
the assessment of the evidence put forth in the 2017 VA/DoD LBP CPG .(113, 160) Therefore, this is a 
Reviewed, New -replaced recommendation. The Work Group’s confidence in the quality of the evidence 
was low. The body of evidence had some limitations including concerns around randomization, allocation procedures, and attrition.( 113) The benefits of NSAIDs for pain and function slightly outweighed the 
potential harm of AEs. Patient values and preferences varied somewhat because some patients prefer 
medication to treat their pain . In addition,  since NSAIDs are over the counter (OTC)  and accessible, they 
may be preferable for patients. In some patient populations including elderly patients,  patients  with GI or 
CV risk, NSAIDs may not be preferred due to risk. The strength of the recommendation was modified from 
Strong for  in the 2017 VA/DoD LBP CPG to Weak for  in this updated CPG based on the inclusion of an 
additional study by Katz et al. ( 2011),( 166) which prompted downgrade to a W eak for  due to limited 
benefit for pain and concerns for AEs. Thus, the Work Group decided upon a Weak for  recommendation.  
Recommendation  
20.For patients with  low back pain, wit h or without radicular symptoms, there is insufficient evidence
to recommend for or against gabapentin or pregabalin.
(Neither for nor against  | Reviewed, Amended )
Discussion  
The evidence review identified an  SR by Shanthanna et al. (2017) , which evaluated patients with radicular 
and non- radicular chronic LBP and included three RCTs. (167) The SR found no difference between 
gabapentin (n=91) and placebo (n=94) in reducing  pain severity or functional o utcomes. The same SR 
(n=163) found an overall improvement in pain with pregabalin (n=163) versus active analgesic  control 
(n=169), with a pooled SMD of  0.42,  (p=0.0002); however, the quality of the evidence was very low. 
Additionally, the individual studies included in the SR had mixed results, with one  of the three studies 
reporting no benefit for pain with pregabalin versus active analgesic contro l.(168) The duration of follow -
up with the studies ranged from 4 – 14 weeks. An RCT studying the treatment of pregabalin in patients 
with radiculopathy, which was not included in the systematic evidence review carried out as part of this CPG and did not influence the strength of the recommendation, reported no significant reduction in leg 
pain intensity and a higher incidence of AEs. (169) 
There are significant adverse effects associated with the use of gabapentin or pregabalin. Evidence from 
the Shanthanna  et al. (2017) SR and another SR by Atkinson et al. (2016) found higher adverse effects with 
gabapentin vers us placebo, including fatigue, dizziness, loss of balance, and difficulties with mental 
concentration, memory, and visual accommodation. (167, 170) A n increased risk of dizziness was reported 
with pregabalin when compared to placebo. (167) Additionally, some subpopulations may be at greater risk 
of sedation and falls with the use of pregabalin or gabapentin.  Antiepileptic medications, including 
pregabalin and gabapentin, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these 
medications for any indications. Patients should be monitored for the emergence of worsening depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any changes  in mood or behavior. (171)  VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Low Back Pain  
February 2022   Page 52 of 141 Pregabalin is a controlled substance  with the potential for abuse and dependence. Gabapentin is not a 
federally scheduled medication; however , some states have scheduled gabapentin as a controlled 
substance due to concerns of addiction and dependence. Additionally, one study, which was not included 
in the systematic  evidence review  carried out as part of this CPG and did not influence the strength of the 
recommendation , indicates that gabapentin in combination with opioids significantly increases the risk of 
opioid -related mortality and respiratory depression. (172) Gabapentin or pregabalin may be beneficial in 
patients with comorbid anxiety or insomnia, as these agents have been use d off -label for these indications.  
The Work Group systematically reviewed evidence related to this recommendation ( 167)  and conside red 
the assessment of the evidence put forth in the 2017 VA/DoD LBP CPG. (170, 173, 174)  The Work Group’s 
confidence in the quality of the evidence was very low. Evidence on antiepileptics was limited to pregabalin and gabapentin, and the  recommendation was amended to reflect this.  Therefore, this is a

around randomization, allocation, and blinding procedures. Shanthanna  et al. (2017) also assessed a high 
risk of bias for most trials. (167) The potential harms of AE s, including medication abuse and dependence, 
slightly outweighed the benefits versus  placebo.  There is large variation in p atient values and preferences , 
as some patients prefer to take a medication for their LBP . Thus, the Work Group decided upon a Neither

(Neither for nor against  | Reviewed, New -added) 
Discussion  
The evidence for the use of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) demonstrate s limited benefit with low to very 
low quality evidence. In an  RCT comparing desipramine (n=37) to benztropine mesylate 0.125  mg (n=33), 
there was no difference in function (as measured by the RMDQ ) or for pain s everity at 12 weeks. (175) 
Another RCT demonstrated no benefit with low  dose amitriptyline (n=72) versus  benztropine mesylate  
(n=74) for function or pain severity at 3 – 6 month follow -up.(176) Active placebo in these RCTs w as 
chosen to mimic the side effects of the treatment group. In addition, a n SR by Chou et al. (2016) 
demonstrated no benefit with TCAs for either function or pain.( 113) However, older studies have shown 
that TCAs as a class provide improvement in pain intensity  (moderate effect size of 0.43) , but were 
inconclusive in regards to function, QoL , or healthcare utilization. (177, 178) 
Providers should use caution when prescribing TCAs to patients  with cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) or a 
family history of sudden death. A baseline electrocardiogram (ECG) is indicated in patients who are age d 
&gt;50 years or with significant cardiac risk factors. (179) The anticholinergic burden should also be considered 
when used in patients aged &gt;65 years, and considerations for the use of secondary amines such as 
nortriptyline or desipramine may be warranted due to decreased anticholinergic burden.  When utilizing 
TCAs, some subpopulations  may be at greater risk of sedation and falls.  There is also a risk of serotonin 
syndrome, particularly when combining with other medications (e.g., antidepressants). All antidepressants

The Work Group systematically reviewed evidence related to this recommendation .(175, 176) Although 
there was no recommendation on TCAs in the 2017 VA/DoD LBP CPG, the Work Group considered the

including  side effects such as  dry mouth, dry eyes, sedation, dizziness, blurred vision, and CV  risks  in 
certain patient s. Patient values and preferences varied somewhat because  some patients prefer 
medications , and TCAs may be used for other comorbidities (e.g., insomnia , headache ). Additionally, some 
patients may be hesitant to take a medication classified as an antidepressant due to stigma surrounding 
mental health.  Thus, the Work Group decided upon a Neither for nor against  recommendation.

Discussion  
Similar to the 2017 VA/DoD LBP CPG,  no studies on the effect of topical preparations met inclusion criteria 
for the 2022 VA/DoD LBP CPG systematic evidence review. However, t he Work Group decided the subject 
still warranted a recommendation because topical  preparations  (e.g., capsaicin creams, diclofenac gel, 
lidocaine patches) are widely used. Moreover, the use of these agents generates frequent questions for 
PCPs.  
These medications were a ddressed in a KQ for  the systematic evidence review of  this CPG.  Therefore,  
although no new evidence was identified,  this is a Reviewed , Amended recommendation. As there was no 
evidence on this topic, the Work Group could not determine the balance of benefits and harms. Patient 
values and preferences were somewhat varied because many patients see topicals as less risky and  less 
harmful than oral medications and prefer non- invasive treatment options. Providers also value these 
medications as having less  risk for AEs and as being more acceptable by patients. For this reason, the Work 
Group decided upon a Neither for nor against  recommendation.

(Weak against  | Reviewed, Not changed )
Discussion  
The systematic evidence review did not identify new studies for use of muscle relaxants to treat LBP ; 
therefore, the Work Group reviewed three studies from the 2017 VA/DoD LBP CPG. One RCT 
demonstrated moderate level evidence that the addition of cyclobenzaprine to naproxen for patients with acute LBP in an ED  setting did not improve functional outcomes or pain at one week follow -up.(181) In one 
SR, muscle relaxants showed some benefit for short -term pain relief (2 – 7 days). (113) This SR contained 
22 studies that included muscle relaxants that are both available within the U.S. (tizanidine, 
cyclobenzaprine, orphenadrine, chlorzoxazone, carisoprodol, baclofen, dantrolene), but also i ncluded 
muscle relaxers that are not available for use within the U.S. (pridinol and tolperisone). (113) The critical 
outcomes, most notably pain, were not rated for this SR as our search criteria excluded outcomes with &lt;3 months of follow -up data. (113)  
For another SR, there were seven muscle relaxants included in the 15 selected trials, some available in the 
U.S. (carisoprodol, tizanidine, cyclobenzaprine) and some unavailable in the U.S. (eperisone, thiocolchicoside, prid inol, flupirtine). (182) The agents that demonstrated statistical benefit for pain were 
unavailable in the U.S. (eperisone and thicolchicoside). Carisoprodol also demonstrated pain relief in the 
short -term, but the Work Group does not support routine use of this agent. (182) Harms/burdens slightly 
outweigh benefits of skeletal muscle relaxant s as they were associated with an increased risk of central 
nervous system  (CNS)  events, primarily sedation. (113, 181, 182) Trials that included carisoprodol were 
associated with an increased risk of sedation and dizziness versus placebo. (113)  
When considering long -term use, there is no evidence to suggest benefit for the use of skeletal muscle 
relaxants for chronic LBP. One SR included a low quality study demonstrating there was no benefit of 
skeletal muscle relaxants when compared to placebo in patients with chronic LBP; (182) another SR  also 
showed no benefit. (113)  
There is some variability in patient preferences regarding use of muscle relaxants for acute  and chronic 
LBP. Some patients may have concerns regarding the sedative properties of muscle relaxants interfering 
with their occupation. Many patients dislike the overall sedative properties of muscle relaxants, but some patients may appreciate the sedative properties if their sleep is disrupted due to LBP . The use of muscle 
relaxants may  be of greater  concern in the elderly population as sedative effects may be more 
burdensome , including the increased risk of falls . Furthermore, m uscle relaxants can interact with other 
medications  and potentially increase  the risk of CNS  depression and sedation. The Wo rk Group  does not 
support  the use of carisoprodol for acute or chronic LBP due to its adverse effect profile, including risk of 
dependence. Carisoprodol is metabolized to an agent that binds to the barbiturate receptor and is  VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Low Back Pain  
February 2022   Page 55 of 141 classified as a Schedule IV controlled substance by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency.  Also,  because of its 
non-formulary status, carisoprodol may require additional effort to obtain and may not be as readily  
available  within the VA .  
For Recommendation 2 3, the Work Group considered the  evidence put forth in the 2017 VA/DoD LBP CPG 
(113, 181, 182) because no studies on the effect of muscle relaxants met inclusion criteria for the 
2022 VA/DoD LBP CPG systematic evidence review. Therefore, this is a Reviewed, New -replaced  
recommendation. The Work Group’s confidence in the quality of evidence was low. The body of evidence 
had some limitations, including inadequate reporting of randomization and allocation concealment 
methods. (113) Low quality trials did not report attrition, had unbalanced groups at baseline, and/or did 
not conduct ITT analyses. (113) The RCT evaluated did not evaluate the adequacy of patient blinding and 
results may only be generalized to similar EDs  serving a similar patient population. (181) There was also 
potential publication bias identified. (182) The reviewed studies were of moderate to low quality. In 
general, the harms/burdens of muscle relaxants were thought to slightly outweigh the benefits as the only 
benefit with muscle relaxants available in the U.S. was seen with carisoprodol, which has significant 
potential harms. It was difficult to determine which specific agents, available in the U.S., showed pain relief 
in the short -term as the evidence available is sparse. Patient values and preferences were somewhat 
varied as some patients may be less accepting of muscle relaxants or may dislike the sedative effect. Thus, the Work Group decided upon a Neither for nor against  recommendation.  
For Recommendation 2 4, the Work Group considered the evidence put forth in the 2017 VA/DoD LBP CPG 
(113, 181, 182) because no studies on the effect of muscle relaxants met inclusion criteria for the 
2022 VA/DoD LBP CPG  systematic evidence review.  Therefore, this is a R eviewed, Not changed 
recommendation. The Work Group’s confidence in the quality of the evidence was very low. The body of evidence had some limitations including inadequate reporting of randomization and allocation 
concealment methods. (113) Low quality trials did not report attrition, had unbalanced groups at baseline, 
and/or did not conduct ITT analyses. (113) The RCT evaluated did not evaluate the adequacy of patient 
blinding and results may only be generalized to similar EDs  serving a similar patient population. (181) There 
was also potential publication bias identified. (182) The reviewed studies were of moderate to low quality. 
The harms and side effects associated with the use of muscle relaxants for chronic LBP  outweigh the 
potential benefits, as there was no evidence of benefit in the literature reviewed . Patient values and 
preferences were somewhat varied as some patients may be less accepting of muscle relaxants or may dislike the sedative effect. Thus, the Work Group decided upon a Weak against  recommendation . 
Recommendation  
25.For patients with low back pain, we suggest against acetaminophen.r
(We

Discussion  
Although the effect of acetaminophen was covered  in the 2022 VA/DoD LBP CPG systematic evidence 
review , no studies on this topic met inclusion criteria. Therefore, the Work Group considered the evidence 
r  Recommendations for “patients with low back pain” encompass patient populations with acute, subacute, or chronic LBP with 
or without neurological symptoms.   VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Low Back Pain  
February 2022   Page 56 of 141 included in the 2017 VA/DoD LBP CPG and consolidated two recommendations ( on acute and chronic LBP ) 
to form this recommendation.  
A large SR (n=1,825) found there was no difference between acetaminophen and placebo in treating acute 
LBP for the outcomes of pain, disability, QoL, or function through 12 weeks. (183) The same SR found no 
effect of acetaminophen on immediate pain reduction for an acute exacerbation of chronic LBP. In a 
second SR, the evidence suggested that acetaminophen was no more effective than placebo  in treating 
acute LBP for the outcomes of pain or function through three weeks .(113) In addition, for chronic LBP, this 
SR found there was insufficient evidence to determine the effects of acetaminophen versus NSAIDs in one 
trial and versus other interventions in four trials.  
Over half of the 2,000 annual cases of acute liver failure in the U.S. are due to intentional and 
unintentional acetaminophen toxicity. (184) In addition, acetaminophen is the most frequent cause of 
acute liver injury, with associated healthcare costs and morbidity. (184) Other considerations include ease 
of accessibility, as acetaminophen is inexpensive and available at a relatively low cost to the patient and 
the system. It is also readily accessible, both OTC and on formulary. Unfortunately, it is easily overused 
without proper education, thus risks and adverse effects may not be well understood by the public. This 
has led to some variation in values and preferences . Some patients may think that acetaminophen is 
innocuous and be unaware of the adverse effects of taking too much. In addition, elderly individuals and 
patients with hepatic insufficiency are subgroups that may be at the most risk for harm. As no benefits were shown in the evidence, the Work Group suggested against the use of acetaminophen; the risk of  
harm in taking acetaminophen predominates other considerations.  Other options, such as NSAIDs (see 
Recommendation 19), can be offered to the patient based on the benefits outweighing the harms.  
The Work Group considered the assessment of the evidence put forth in the 2017 VA/DoD LBP CPG. (113, 
183) Therefore, this is a R eviewed, New -replaced  recommendation. The Work Group’s confidence in the
quality of the evidence was low. The potential harms of taking acetaminophen slightly outweighed the 
benefits, which were not demonstrated in the evidence base. Patient values and preferences were 
somewhat  varied because  some patients may prefer medications, and some are unaware of the side 
effects of taking too much. Thus, the Work Group decided upon a Weak against recommendation.
Recommendation  
26.For patients with low back pain, we suggest against monoclonal antibodies.s
(We
ak against  | Reviewed, New -added)
Discussion  
The utilization and clinical potential of monoclonal antibodies (mAb) for diverse disease processes and illnesses has markedly increased recently. The systematic evidence review found only two RCTs 
investigating the effectiveness of anti -nerve growth factors fasinumab and tanezumab. At the time of 
this review, these products were still investigational; neither of them have received final FDA approval in the U.S.  
s  Recommendations for “patients with low back pain” encompass patient populations with acute, subacute, or chronic LBP with 
or without neurological symptoms.   VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Low Back Pain  
February 2022   Page 57 of 141 In the RCT by Dakin et al. (2020), fasinumab, with both IV and subcutaneous (SC) delivery methods and 
two different doses (6 mg and 9 mg) at varying intervals (dosed every 4 or 8 weeks), was compared against 
placebo. (185) Even though there were some trends toward improvement in functional status and pain 
severity, many study arms showed no significant difference in effect. More significantly, the interpretation and applicability of this study is confounde d by a n FDA safety intervention. Due to an adverse joint safety 
event (JSE) in a patient with co -existing OA, the study was placed on an FDA hold and then terminated 
early. This led to many patients receiving less than the planned doses (only 35 – 56% of p atients received 
the complete planned dosage). S erious AEs were reviewed at greater than 16 weeks , and in all groups 
receiving fasinumab some participants  developed r apidly progressive osteoarthritis (RPOA). Additionally,  a 
higher number of RPOA cases were reported in the higher dosage group.  
In the RCT by Markman et al. (2020), (186) tanezumab dosed at 5 mg or  10 mg subcutaneously every eight 
weeks was compared to placebo or active control (tramadol 100 mg – 300 mg). In the critical outcome of 
pain severity  as determined by LBPI , the 5 mg dosage did not statistically differ from the placebo or 
control. In the 1 0 mg arm, there was no difference versus control. However, the 10 mg dosage showed a 
statistically significant difference versus placebo: LBPI : -0.40 (CI : -0.76 to - 0.04); on a scale of 1 – 10; which 
was considered not clinically meaningful . Although neith er dosage of tanezumab met the primary 
endpoint for statistically  and clinically significant improvement, the authors did assess secondary 
outcomes. U sing a LBPI improvement of &gt;30%  both dosages demonstrated significant  improvement in all 
comparisons. Howe ver, a conclusion of superiority could not be made using only this secondary endpoint. 
There was an improvement in functional status (as measured by the RMDQ) that reached statistical 
significance for both 5 mg and 10 mg tanezumab versus placebo and active  control  at 16 weeks follow -up. 
In the evaluation of serious and severe AE s at 16 week s follow -up, both mAb dosages resulted in fewer AEs  
than the active control, but an equal or greater number when compared to placebo .(186)  
Patients achieving &gt;30% improvement in LBPI, or &gt;15% improvement from baseline in weeks 1 – 15, 
continued in a longitudinal follow -up focused on AEs.(186) In this phase, the patients originally assigned 
placebo were placed into one of the tanezumab groups (5 mg or 10 mg every eight weeks), and the control was tramadol. At 24 and 56 weeks, the authors reported no treatment -related mortality. Serious and 
severe AEs were lower in the 5 mg group versus control and slightly higher in the 10 mg treatment group.  
More significantly, overall JSEs were reported through 80 weeks follow -up. The authors determined 
30 patients had joint AEs that were assessed in depth. The most concerning event was RPOA, which 
occurred more frequently in tanezumab 5 mg (n=5) than active control (n=1) or placebo (n=0). In 
addition, the number of RPOA cases (n=16) was higher in the tanezumab 10 mg group, suggesting a dose 
related effect.  
The Work Group systematically reviewed evidence related to this recommendation. (185, 186) Therefore, 
this is a Reviewed, New -added recommendation. The Work Group’s confidence in the quality of the 
evidence was very low. The harms and burdens outweighed the benefit, with serious safety concerns due 
to adverse JSEs  and RPOA in both mAb products. In addition, the interruption of one trial due to AE s and 
the decision by the FDA to not approve these products would negatively affect provider and patient acceptability. The Work Group also expects the status as a new/experimental drug, and IV or SC 
administration will lead to decreased acceptability by patients. Patient values and preferences were  VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Low Back Pain  
February 2022   Page 58 of 141 somewhat varied because some patients may not prefer newer medications with unknown side effects;  
and there is an opportunity cost associated with repeated visits  for administration . Thus, the Work Gr oup 
decided upon a Weak against recommendation.   
Recommendation  
27.For patients with chronic low back pain, we suggest  against opioids. For patients who are already 
using long -term opioids, see the VA/DoD CPG for the Use of Opioids in the Management of 
Chroni c Pain t.t 
(Wea
k against  | Reviewed, New -replaced ) 
Discussion  
While the literature base suggests potential benefit in some patients, the W eak against  recommendation 
for opioid s is based on the significant risks associated with use of opioids as determined in the  VA/DoD 
CPG for the Use of Opioids in the Management of Chronic Pain.t None of the studies from the current LBP 
CPG systematic evidence review provided data to allow makin g conclusions on the long -term (more than 
six months) efficacy and safety of opioids for chronic LBP. 
The evidence  related to use of opioids in chronic LBP  includes one SR and meta -analysis by Petzke et al. 
(2020) that consisted of 21 RCTs for chronic LBP , with only three  RCTs published since the 201 7 VA/DoD 
LBP CPG and the majority rated fair quality. (187) Thus, the majority of evidence for consideration by the 
Work Group was already included in the 2017 VA/DoD LBP CPG . The current systematic evidence review  
also included two  fair quality  individual RCTs. (186, 188)  
The RCTs included in Petzke et al. (2020) e xamined at least four  weeks of treatment with opioids  for 
chronic LBP .(187) Opioids in this SR included buprenorphine (transdermal  and buccal), hydrocodone, 
hydromorphone, morphine, oxycodone, oxycodone/naloxone, oxycodone/naltrexone, oxymorphone, 
tapentadol , and tramadol. Overall, for a 4 – 15 week follow -up period, most of the evidence comparing 
opioids with placebo for chronic LBP fa vored opioid s. For the critical outcome of functional status, 
moderate quality evidence from this SR suggests  patients in the opioids group experienced a greater 
reduction in disability compared with those in the placebo group at 4 – 15 weeks follow -up for  all meta -
analyses performed .(187) The authors considered the benefit of opioids in the reduction of disability 
clinically meaningful in c omparison to placebo. For the critical outcome of pain severity, moderate to low 
quality evidence from this SR suggests that pain improved at follow -up for patients receiving opioids 
compared with those receiving placebo for all pain measures: ≥50% pain re lief, ≥30% pain relief, mean 
pain intensity, and patient global impression questionnaire.  
The two individual RCTs provide moderate to low quality evidence demonstrating  no difference between 
opioids and placebo for pain or function. Low quality evidence fr om one RCT comparing tramadol with 
placebo in a chronic LBP treatment refractory population reported that improvement assessed using the 
RMDQ  did not differ between groups at any time point during weekly assessments up to 16 weeks follow -
up, and pain intensity was slightly reduced only at weeks one and eight .(186) Evidence from one RCT 
suggests that patients receiving extended- release oxycodone and sequestered naltrexone did not differ

February 2022   Page 59 of 141 from the placebo group at 12 weeks follow -up regarding functional impairment, as assessed by the Work 
Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI) Questionnaire for percentage of work time missed, 
impairment while working, overall wo rk impairment, and activity impairment. (188) The quality concerns 
were attrition &gt;20% in one  RCT (186) and study design in the other RCT ,(188) with an uncontrolled open-
label  titration period resulting in a study population enriched with treatment responders.  
The evidence base also  included two SRs already considered in  the 2017 VA/DoD  LBP CPG that showed 
small additional analgesic effects with opioid s beyond those seen with placebo for acute or chronic LBP 
(moderate quality evidence). (113, 189) In the meta -analysis by Abdel et al. (2016) , the MD  between single -
ingredient opioids and placebo in pain intensity was - 8.1 on a 0 – 100 VAS. (189) In another  SR, the 
standardized MD between strong opioids ( e.g., hyd romorphone, morphine, oxycodone, 
oxycodone/naltrexone combination, oxymorphone, and tapentadol) and placebo was - 0.43 (seven trials), 
equivalent to a n MD of about one point on a 0  – 10 NRS.(113) Neither study reported the percentage of 
patients who achieved clinically important (≥30%) improvements from baseline in pain intensity.  
According to a meta -analysis  of three RCTs , opioid s produced no clinically important improvements in 
function relative to placebo at 30 to 91 days; however, results were inconclusive  with a wide CI .(189) In an 
SR, short -term therapy (less than six months) with o pioids resulted in small, clinically unimportant 
additional improvements in function over placebo. (113) The standardized MD  relative to placebo 
was - 0.26 (four trials), representing a difference of about one point on a 2 4-point RMDQ scale. Trials that 
compared opioids and other drug therapies (e.g., acetaminophen, NSAIDs, antidepressants) were limited, and the strength of evidence was insufficient to make conclusions for either pain or functional outcomes . 
Regarding  AEs, low quality evidence from one  SR indicates that opioid and placebo groups did not differ in 
serious AEs or mortality. (187) One RCT reported an inconclusive result for serious and severe AEs  that 
were similar in the tramadol and placebo group. (186) The meta -analysis by Abdel  et al. (2016) showed that 
the median incidence of AEs was 68.9% for opioid groups and 49.1% for placebo groups, with a RR  of 1.3 
(eight trials). In four of  the eight trials, 50% of study patients discontinued treatment because of AEs  or 
lack of efficacy. Thus, the small differential benefits of short -term opioid use  were counterbalanced by 
increases in risks of adverse effects seen with short -term opioid use . 
In many of the RCTs in the SR by Petzke et al. (2020), there were concerns around randomization and 
allocation procedures, high attrition, and lack of blinding. (187) The authors themselves identified 
limitations due to industry sponsoring and publication bias. They note that these were research studies, with most studies excluding patients with clinically relevant somatic or psychiatric diseases, in  particular, 
patients with current or previous substance abuse. None of these studies were in the primary care setting, and there was a lack of diversity, as  the majority of the participants were middle -aged  white women. They 
also noted that sleep problems, physical dependence, abuse,  and addiction of prescribed opioids were 
only analyzed in some studies.  
Of major concern is that these studies do not allow making  conclusions on the long -term (more than six  
months) efficacy and safety of opioids for chronic LBP. Petzke et al.  (2020)  noted the limited data for 
longer than 12 weeks, and the weak finding in the subgroup analysis indicat ed increased dropout rates for 
studies with a duration of more than 12 weeks. (187)  VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Low Back Pain  
February 2022   Page 60 of 141 The trials included in the SRs did not assess the risks of long -term opioid use. Opioid risks and risk 
assessment for chronic non- cancer pain are discussed in more detail in the VA/DoD CPG for the Use of 
Opioids in the Management of Chronic Pain that documents serious risks with opioid therapy, in particular 
opioid use disorder (OUD) and overdose, that increase with longer duration and with higher dosage o f, 
opioid therapy but  may occur even at low opioid dosage and short -term use .u  
No clinical trials identified by the systematic evidence review  evaluated time -limited (less than seven days) 
opioid therapy, as such studies were not part of the evidence base . Therefore, the Wor k Group decided to 
not make a recommendation regarding the short -term  use of opioids for acute LBP or acute exacerbation 
of chronic LBP.   
Despite moderate to low quality evidence of benefit of opioids compared with pla cebo for pain and 
function at 4 – 15 w eeks follow -up in the SR by Petzke et al . (2020) , and inconclusive evidence for serious 
AEs and mortality, the Work Group concluded that the potential harms of opioids outweigh the potential 
benefits in patients with LBP. (187) The available evidence from this SR  was only 15 weeks with low quality 
evidence demonstrating no serious AE. Assessment of abuse and addiction was incomplete. Based on what 
is known for chronic non- cancer pain in general (not specific to LBP), the small  benefit  of short -term opioid 
use seen in LBP trials may be substantially outweighed by serious risks , including potentially fatal 
respiratory depression, overdose, misuse, abuse, addiction, and diversion — risks that pose considerable 
harms not only to the patient, but also relatives, friends, and the public. The risk of addiction during opioid 
use, which may start with the first dose administered,  increases substantially with duration and dosage of 
opioid therapy, and need s to be taken into consideration and weighed against the actual therapeutic 
benefits in individual cases. Thus, the Work Group issued a weak recommendation against the use of 
opioids for chronic LBP. 
While not included in the evidence base of this CPG due to the study design ( e.g., open -label RCT , no 
crossover design, allowance for use of tramadol in the non- opioid group ) and a mixed treatment 
populatio n consisting of patients with moderate pain from hip and knee  OA in addition to LBP, the study 
by Krebs et al. (2018) is the only opioids study published that extends to 12 months .(190) Treatment with 
opioids was not superior to treatment with non- opioid medications for improving pain- related function 
over 12 months (overall p=0.58) . Pain intensity was  slightly, but  significantly better in the no n-opioid group 
(overall p=.03); and a dverse medication -related symptoms were more common in the opioid group over 
12 months (overall p =.03) . 
Patients’ values, preferences, and treatment goals regarding opioids can vary widely, both between 
individuals and in the same individual over time. Some patients may be reluctant to take opioids because of the risk of addiction or fear of stigma, while others may seek a therapeutic opioid trial despite the 
marginal benefits over placebo. Additionally, some subpopulations may be at greater risk of sedation and 
falls with the use of opioids . The patient focus group participants indicated a desire for education about 
pain medications, particularly opioids.

February 2022   Page 61 of 141 dose, formulation, route of administration, drug interactions, and other factors may influence decisions 
regarding whether or not to try a time -limited course. For LBP refractory to NSAIDs, or for patients with 
contraindication to NSAIDs (such as due to anticoagulation), opioids are the only remaining drug treatment with evidence of effectiveness , although the analgesic effects were small relative to placebo and pertained 
to short -term therapy, with no clear evidence of long -term benefit.  
The findings from one SR comparing opioids with placebo, identified in the  current  systematic evidence 
review,  are in  line with the evidence from the 2017 VA/DoD LBP  CPG.  Moderate to low quality evidence 
shows a benefit of opioids compared with placebo for pain and function at 4 – 15 weeks follow -up, in 
patients with chronic LBP,  and there is inconclusive evidence for serious AEs and mortality.  
The Work Group systematically reviewed evidence related to Recommendation 27  (186- 188) and 
considered the assessment of the evidence put forth in the 201 7 VA/DoD  LBP CPG. (113, 189) Therefore, 
this is a Reviewed, New, Replaced recommendation. The Work Group’s confidence in the quality of the 
evidence was low . The body of evidence had some limitations particularly in regards to the duration of 
treatment (no studies &gt;6 months) and long -term follow -up, study population, and lack o f assessm ent for 
substance abuse and addiction long -term. The concern about potentially catastrophic harm related to OUD  
and overdose deaths  outweighed the benefits that appear small and likely short -term . Patient values and 
preferences were varied with so me patients seeking opioids despite risks , and others avoiding them due to 
safety concerns. Thus, the Work Group decided upon a Weak  against  recommendation.  No studies in the 
patient population with acute LBP met inclusion criteria, thus the Work Group del eted the specific 
recommendation for acute LBP from the 2017 VA/DoD LBP CPG (see 2017 Recommendation 
Categorization Table ). 
Recommendation

(Weak  against  | Not reviewed, Amended ) 
Discussion  
The use of systemic corticosteroids for the treatment of acute or chronic LBP  with or without 
radiculopathy is not recommended.  The evidence reviewed for systemic corticosteroids is the same as the 
previous 2017 CPG update, as there was no new evidence mee ting our search criteria for the 2022 VA/DoD  
LBP CPG systematic evidence review . Moderate quality evidence from one SR and one RCT failed to 
demonstrate efficacy related to pain. (113, 191). Most of the trials included in the SR were of at least fair 
quality, all of which showed no significant improvements in pain or function in a variety of settings, with 
both single intramuscular boluses or oral tapers of varying doses and durations. The RCT did show a 
statistically significant improvement in disability  for patients treated with a 15 day course of oral

favor ed prednisone vs. placebo for improvement of the mental health component of an SF -36 but no 
difference was found for the physical component. (191) There is inconclusive evidence that corticosteroids

to very low quality. (113) While pro viders and patients may wish to trial systemic corticosteroids for LBP or 
radiculopathy, the evidence suggests efficacy does not outweigh the potential risks.  
There is some variability in patient preferences regarding use of systemic corticosteroids as so me patients 
may seek alternative treatment options when other treatments fail. In addition, repeated use of systemic 
corticosteroids significantly increases the risk of side effects over time.  
The Work Group considered the assessment of the evidence put f orth in the 2017 VA/DoD LBP CPG. (113, 
191) Therefore, this is a Not reviewed, Amended  recommendation. The Work Group’s confidence in the 
quality of the evidence was  low.  Despite moderate quality evidence showing corticosteroids don’t benefit 
pain outcomes, which we acknowledge as critical, the overall quality of the evidence was low based on 
poor quality evidence for the o ther critical outcomes of QoL and function. Th e potential harms of systemic
corticosteroids slightly outweighed the benefits. Some well -informed patients might choose treatment 
with a corticosteroid based on the possibility of improved QoL and function, but most would not , due to
proven AEs. Thus, the Work Group decided upon a Weak  against recommendation .

(St

Discussion  
The systematic  evidence review included a single RCT for acute LBP, in addition to an SR from the 
2017 VA/DoD LBP CPG. The RCT by Friedman et al. (2017) demonstrated, with moderate quality evidence 
in patients with acute non- radicular back pain, the lack of benefit from  adding diazepam to naproxen, with 
no difference regarding  the critical outcomes of pain severity and functional status, after one week and 
three months. (192) Specifically, in the active treatment group, diazepam 5 mg tablets with 1 – 2 tablets 
every 12 hours as needed were added to naproxen 500 mg twice a day. The RMDQ score of 112 patients after one week was identical between groups. However, m ore patients  reported moderate or severe LBP  
in the diazepam group (18 of 57 patients, 32%; 95% CI: 21% to 45%) than in the placebo group (12 of 
55 patients, 22%; 95% CI: 13% to 35%). At three  month s follow -up, 6 of 50 patients on diazepam (12%) 
versus 5 of 53 patients receiving placebo (9%) reported moderate or severe LBP. AEs were reported by 
12 of 57 patients in the diazepam group (21%) and 8 of 55 in the placebo group (15%).  
The evidence in chronic LBP is less conclusive. A good quality SR by Chou et al. (2016) found inconclusive 
evidence between diazepam and placebo with respect to LBP improvement. (113) The SR identified one 
RCT (n=60)  by Brotz et al. (2010) which reported efficacy data for patients randomized to receive placebo 
or diazepam two times 5 mg daily, followed by a taper. (193) Follow -up examinations were scheduled at 
six weeks and one year after discharge. The median duration of the stay in the hospital was shorter in the 
placebo arm (eight versus ten days , p=0.008), and the probability of pain reduction on the VAS by more

(p=0.0015). Other outcome measures, though inconclusive, tended to favor placebo over diazepam 
including workdays lost, disability, and healthcare utilization.  
The SR reported low quality evidence for CNS AEs such as somnolence, fatigue, and lightheadedness  with 
benzodiazepines versus placebo. (113) In addition, the potential for abuse, addiction/dependence, 
overdose potentially resulting in death, respiratory depression, and sleep apnea do not justify their use. 
Some subpopulations  are at greater risk of sedation and falls with use of benzodiazepines.  
There is modera te quality evidence for acute LBP and low  quality evidence for chronic LBP indicating that 
the harms/burden of benzodiazepine use outweigh the benefits. Some patients may prefer benzodiazepines, but the abuse potential should be taken into consideration. T he adverse CNS effects 
(e.g., sedation, cognitive impact) may be even greater in patients also receiving other pain medication with 
similar side effects (polypharmacy). These associated risks are further compounded when benzodiazepines 
are combined with opioids, in particular , the risk for respiratory depression and overdose death ( see the 
VA/DoD CPG for the Use of Opioids in the Management Chronic Pain).
w There are also subgroup 
considerations such as patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease at  higher risk for respiratory 
depression or patients with comorbid SUD.  
The Work Group systematically reviewed evidence related to this recommendation ( 192)  and considered 
the assessment of the evidence put forth in the 2017 VA/DoD LBP CPG. (113)  Therefore, this is a Reviewed, 
Not changed recommendation. The Work Group’s confidence in the quality of the evidence was moderate 
for acute LBP and low for chronic LBP. The body of evidence had some limitations including small sample 
size (192) and inconclusive findings. (113) The harms of benzodiazepines (potentially severe) outweighed 
the benefits (no benefit on pain severity or functional outcome). Patient values and preferences were somewhat varied because some patients may subjectively prefer benzodiazepines, with the potential for  
abuse noted by the Work Group. Thus, the Work Group decided upon a Strong against  recommendation.

There is large variability in patient preferences. Some patients prefer to take medication they consider to 
be more natural or may be interested in specific supplements (e.g., turmeric, cannabinoids), while others 
do not have a preference. Despite no serum level or dose of vitamin D showing improvement in LBP, the 
monitoring of vitamin D blood levels is considered a barrier to treatment.

the assessment of the evidence put forth in the 2017 VA/DoD LBP CPG. (195) Therefore, this is a Reviewed,

confidence in the quality of the evidence was very low. Although there was no benefit found over any 
other treatment, there was also no harm found over any other treatment, including placebo. Patient 
values and preferences varied, as some patients may prefer specific supplements over others. Thus, the Work Group decided upon a Neither for nor against  recommendation.

Lumbar radiofrequency neurotomy is a procedure offered commonly in VA/DoD pain clinics. There is some 
variability in patient preferences regarding this treatment as some patients do not prefer invasi ve 
procedures. Additionally, some patients may not want to undergo a procedure that is ablating nerves. For patients in more remote or rural areas, access to specialty pain medicine providers is likely limited which 
would impact the availability of this in tervention. For those patients where surgery is not an option for 
medical or anatomical reasons, this intervention would provide an alternative.  
Lumbar medial branch/sacral lateral branch diagnostic injections as well as sacroiliac joint diagnostic and 
therapeutic injections are utilized at many VA/DoD facilities for  the treatment of LBP and/or in the 
identification of painful structures in the lumbar spine.  
For sacroiliac joint injections, no evidence was retrieved based on the predetermined search criteria and 
time period for the 2017 or 2022 VA/DoD LBP CPG systematic evidence reviews. The Work Group 
therefore agreed on a Neither for nor against  recommendation for sacroiliac joint injections.  
The use of intra -articular facet joint injections is less com mon in pain clinics than in past years due to the 
lack of evidence for this procedure.  However, c onsiderations may be made for subgroups in whom RFA 
may not be as desirable . In comparison to the 2017 VA/DoD LBP CPG, no studies on these interventions 
met th e search criteria for this CPG update. In the 2017 VA/DoD LBP CPG, evidence assessing the efficacy 
of facet joint injections ( 198, 199) and therapeutic medial branch block injections ( 199) were generally 
rated as low or very low quality. Facet injections or medial branch blocks using corticosteroids did not generally perform better than saline injections, local anesthetic injections or oral NSAIDs for pain, function, 
return to work, or QoL. The use of diagnostic medial or lateral branch blocks, which are injections of 
anesthetic for temporary (hours) blockade of these nerves, is considered standard of care for determining 
a patient’s candidacy for lumbar or sacral radiofrequency neurotomy. This is different than therapeutic 
blocks which would include addition of corticosteroid to the injectate to provide medium or long -term 
(weeks to months) benefit; thus, the lack of evidence for therapeutic medial branch blocks in the 2017 VA/DoD LBP CPG does not impact the strength of the recommendation for radiofrequency ablation.  
The Work Group systematically reviewed evidence related to Recommendation 3 1 (196) and considered 
the assessment of the evidence put forth in the 2017 VA/DoD LBP CPG. (197) Therefore, this is a 
Reviewed, New -replaced recommendation. The Work Group’s confidence in the quality of the evidence 
regarding  radiofrequency neurotomy of the lumbar medial branches or sacral lateral branches was 
moderate. The body of evidence had some limitations including exclusion of patients with uncontrolled 
depression or psychiatric disorders; evidence in these populations is potentially not generalizable to a 
chronic pain population. The benefits of improved pain and small impacts on disability and QoL for radiofrequency neurotomy of the lumbar medial or sacral lateral branches were balanced with the 
potential harms (e.g.,  post -radiofrequency neuritis, impact of denervation of paraspinal muscles) which 
were not assessed in the SR by Chen et al. (2019). (196) Patient values and preferences were somewhat 
varied regarding this treatment. Some patients do not wish to undergo invasive procedures or one that 
ablates nerves, while other patients may prefe r a passive injection- based treatment that provides  VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Low Back Pain

The Work Group systematically reviewed evidence related to Recommend ation 3 2 as part of this CPG and

the topic of sacroi liac joint injections,  the Work Group could not determine the balance of benefits and

The Work Group systematically reviewed evidence related to Recommendation 3 3 as part of this CPG 
update; however, no studies on injection of corticosteroids for intra -articular facet joint injections  and 
therapeutic medial branch blocks with steroid met inclusion criteria. The Work Group also considered 
the assessment of the evidence put forth in the 2017 VA/DoD LBP CPG. (198, 199) Therefore, this is a

from the 2017 VA/DoD LBP CPG was very low. The body of evidence for intra -articular facet joint 
injections had some limitations and most findings were inconclusive or were not considered to be 
clinically meaningful. The benefits of using intra -articular facet joint injections were balanced with any 
potential harms, such as risks and complications associated with injections. Two small studies assessing therapeutic medial branch blocks were inconclusive for pain and function. (199) While there were no 
studies demonstrating serious AEs  from therapeutic medial branch blocks, the Work Group felt the risks 
of an invasive procedure involving injection of steroids slightly outweighed the inconclusive effects on 
pain and function. Patient values and preferences were somewhat varied as some patients may not 
want to receive injections or undergo an interventional procedure. Thus, the Work Group decided upon a Weak against  recommendation.  
Recommendation  
34.For patients with chronic low back pain, we suggest acupuncture. (Weak for | Reviewed, Amended)

Discussion  
Acupuncture appears to have a small benefit for the reduction of pain for those with chronic LBP in the 
intermediate -term (3 – 12 months). (200- 202) The evidence from two SRs  (200, 201) and one small RCT 
(202) favored acupuncture over sham for the critical outcome of pain intensity. The use of sham as a 
comparator for acupuncture studies complicates the evidence review due to the variety and types of sham comparator used. The effect size reported by Li et al. (2020) was very small  (SMD: -0.17) , and in Mu et al. 
(2020) , the improvements were statistically significant but did not meet the threshold of clinical relevance 
as determined by the authors .(201) Qin et al. (2020) found results for acupuncture compared to sham for 
pain intensity were both statistically significant and clinically important  at six months  in a small RCT (n=80). VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Low Back Pain  
February 2022   Page 67 of 141 Evidence from Chou et al. (2016) was inconclusive for the comparison of acupuncture to sham related to 
pain. (113) The comparison of acupuncture to usual care for pain intensity reported in the meta -analysis 
(n=1 ,060) by Li et al . (2020) ( 200) favored acupuncture with a moderate effect size (SMD: - 0.51) in the 
intermediate -term (3 – 12 months ) but no difference in the long -term (2 years)  (n=162) . Mu et al. (2020) 
also analyzed acupuncture compared to usual care for pain intensity and again desc ribed the 
improvements as not clinically relevant  (MD: -12.30)  despite statistical significance. (201)  
Evidence surrounding the critical outcomes of disability and back -specific function was mixed for those 
with chronic LBP based on the data from two SRs and one small RCT. (200-202) Mu et al . (2020) favored 
acupuncture over sham with a very small effect size  (SMD: -0.16)  for back -specific function; however , 
there was no difference noted in pain- related disability. Li et al. (2020) re ported no difference for function 
between acupuncture and the sham comparator. Qin et al. (2020) found that results for acupuncture 
compared to sham for disability were both statistically significant and clinically important  (adjusted mean:  
-3.8; MCID: 2.25] at 6 months after treatment in a small RCT (n=80). (202) When compared to usual care ,
Mu et al. (2020) found a statistically significant difference favoring acupuncture with a small effect size
(SMD: -0.44)  for function.  QoL measures  were reported by Mu et al. (2020) as statistically significant 
favoring acupuncture compared to both sham  (SMD: 0.21)  and usual care  (MD: 5.80) in the intermediate -
term (4  – 12 months) , although the change was not clinically important when compared to sha m.(201)
AEs were reported by Mu et al. (2020) in both acupuncture compared to sham and acupuncture compared 
to usual care. They report that AEs  were similar between acupuncture and sham groups (RR: 0.68) based 
on 4 studies (n=465) .(201) In one small study (n=74) included in the review for acupuncture compared to 
usual care , there were three  AEs reported in the acupuncture group and one  in the usual care group 
(RR:  3.34) , and all were mild and transient. (201) Qin et al. (2020) report eight  participants ( three  in 
acupuncture group and five  in sham group) experiencing AEs that were mild or moderate and did not 
require further intervention.   
There was insufficient data from which to draw conclusions on the use of acupuncture for the treatment of acute LBP. Patients with acute LBP were included in one SR; (200) however, the data related to acute LBP 
were not separated  in the results. One SR  from the 2017 VA /DoD LBP CPG was also evaluated .(113) It 
included data on ac ute LBP with low quality evidence and mixed results related to the critical outcomes 
discussed above.  
There is some variability in patient and provider preferences related to acupuncture, as some patients 
are not comfortable with needle -based treatment while others may prefer such non-pharmacologic 
provider -delivered treatment s. Acupuncture is generally ac cepted as a safe intervention; however, the 
clinical relevance of the effects on pain severity may not outweigh the opportunity cost of attending 
appointments for some patients , given that the data related to function, disability and QoL were mixed. 
Consid erations may be made for subgroups including those who are at risk for adverse outcomes from 
pharmacologic interventions. Access to qualified acupuncture providers may be a barrier especially in rural areas.  
The Work Group systematically reviewed evidence related to R ecommendation 34 (200- 202) and 
considered the assessment of the evidence put forth in the 2017 VA/DoD LBP CPG. (113) Therefore, this  is  a

the data related to the critical outcomes of function, disability, and QoL were mixed, the focus of this 
recommendation is on the critical outcome of pain severity. T he benefits related to pain severity slightly 
outweighed the potential harm of this relatively safe intervention. Patient values and preferences varied 
somewhat because  some patients may not prefer needle -based interventions such as acupuncture . Thus, 
the Work Group decided upon a Weak for recommendation.  
The Work Group systematically reviewed evidence related to R ecommendation 3 5 (200) and considered

body of evidence had some limitations including imprecision and inconclusive data, (113) and risk of 
bias. (200) The low risk of harm was balanced with opportunity cost and lack of evidence of efficacy for 
acute LBP. Patient values and preferences were somewhat varied because  some patients may not prefer 
needle -based interventions or those based on Eastern m edical foundations. Thus, the Work Group dec ided

Recommendation  
36.For patients with low back pain, there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against ortho -
biologics (e.g., platelet -rich plasma, stem cells).aa
(Nei
ther for nor against | Reviewed, New -added)
Discussion  
Evidence suggests injection of platelet -rich plasma (PRP) results in a statistically significant but not clinically 
meaningful improvement in pain in patients with LBP. The SR by Xuan et al. (2020) found treatment with 
PRP was associated with improvements in pain with only low confidence in the quality of evidence. (203) 
These findings may not be generalizable, as the included studies had varying  anatomical targets, the pain 
score reduction was not a clinically meaningful reduction (MD: - 1.47 on a 0 – 10 scale ), and the sample size 
was small (n&lt;100).  
A single RCT by Amirdelfan et al. (2021) assessing a total of 100 patients demonstrated stem cell  injections 
were favored over control with improvements in pain, disability, and QoL, but it is unclear if the differences are statistically significant .(204) This RCT did not report p- values at 12 - or 24 -month follow -up.  
There were no other studies identified in the systematic evidence review  for either of these interventions 
to demonstrate the reproducibility or generalizability of these interventions. Ortho -biologic injections 
were not assessed in the 2017 VA/DoD LBP CPG; therefore, no prior studies were assessed as part of this 
evidence rev iew.  
There is some variability in patient preferences regarding this treatment. While some patients seek out 
emerging interventional therapies, ortho -biologic injections for LBP  are infrequently requested. As is the 
case with invasive procedures, some patients who are needle -averse will not pursue or accept this 
treatment. Additionally, patients may be hesitant to receive donor stem cells which further increases the

biologic injections, as the few providers with specialized training needed for both PRP and stem cell 
injections and the infrastructure and cost required to perform them  result in limited access.  
The Work Group systematically reviewed ev idence related to this recommendation. (203, 204) Therefore, 
this is a Reviewed, New -added recommendation. The Work Group’s confidence in the quality of the 
evidence was low. The body of evidence had some limitations including small sample size for both 
interventions, short -term follow -up and variability in the anatomic targets for the studies assessing 
platelet -rich plasma injections, and lack of a larger evidence base demonstrating reproduci bility of the 
findings .(203, 204) The Work Group determined the potential harms of injecting PRP or stem cells, such as 
infection or disruption of the intervertebral disc, slightly outweigh the potential benefits of pain reduction 
(for both PRP  and stem cells) and small benefits seen for pain, disability , and QoL (for stem cells). Patient 
values and preferences were somewhat varied because these interventions are relatively new and not 
routinely requested by most patients; however,  some patients seek out emerging therapies for pain. 
Additionally, some patients are needl e averse. Thus, the Work Group decided upon a Neither for nor 
against  recommendation.  
Recommendation  
37. For patients with low back pain, with radicular symptoms, there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against epidural steroid injections.  
(Neither for nor against | Reviewed, New- replaced ) 
Discussion  
There is mixed evidence regarding the effect of epidural steroid injections (ESI) on the improvement of pain at three months. This includes one SR (n=490) by Yang et al. (2020) which compared ESI to 
cons ervative treatment in patients with lumbosacral radicular pain secondary to lumbar disc herniation or 
spinal stenosis and found moderate quality evidence for a small , statistically significant improvement in 
pain at three months. (205) The SR found no difference for functional improvement at three months 
between ESI and conservative treatment. Yang et al. (2020) represents the only evidence captured for the 2022 VA/DoD LBP CPG assessing ESI in comparison to  non-injection treatments.  
The findings of short duration reduction in pain but not function noted in the SR from Yang et al. (2020) 
(205) are consistent with the findings from Chou et al. (2015). (199) The 2015 Chou et al. SR identified  
moderate  quality evidence that  ESIs improv ed pain relief compared to placebo in the immediate term 
(defined as 5 – 14 days). The size of the pain reduction in the Chou et al. (2015) SR  (approximately a 0.75 
point reduction on a 10 point scale)  was small and not felt to be clinically meaningful . The systematic 
evidence review did not evaluate outcomes shorter than three months , so a direct comparison of 
outcomes less than two weeks is not available.  
In contrast  to Yang et al. (2020), (205) another SR  (n=351) from Manchikanti et al. (2020)  (206) assessing 
the effects of epidural steroids plus bupivacaine in comparison to bupivacaine alone did not find any 
difference  in pain or function between the two groups at three months. This SR assessed the intervention 
in patients with LBP  or radicular pain due to disc herniation or foraminal stenosis.   VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Low Back Pain  
February 2022   Page 70 of 141 The evidence base assessing ESI outcomes at six and 12 months  included two  SRs, including the SR from 
Yang et al. (2020) , which found a statistically significant and clinically relevant improvement in pain when 
ESI was compared to conservative treatment. (205) This is in contrast to the SR (n= 2,470) from Oliveira et 
al. (2020)  which compared epidural steroids to placebo injection in patients with lumbosacral radi cular 
pain, but excluded central spinal canal stenosis, and found no improvement in back pain or disability at 
three to 12 months or greater than 12 months. (207) 
A single RCT from Abedini et al. (2018) compared epidural steroids to injection with bupivacaine or saline 
in patients  with LBP due to lumbar disc herniation. (208) This study favored epidural steroids for function 
but not pain at three months. The small sample size (n=28 in each arm) was not sufficient to impact the 
findings from the multiple SRs.  
The quality of data assessing AEs  and harms in the reviewed studies was insufficient to draw any 
conclusions.  In addition, there was a lack of studies assessing the efficacy of ESI  in spinal stenosis alone or 
in LBP alone to draw separate conclusions.  
ESIs are an option at many VA/DoD fac ilities for treating LBP, including lumbar radiculopathy, and are most 
commonly provided in pain clinics or radiology departments. Unlike other interventional procedures, ESIs 
are quite common; it is unlikely there would be significant access or equity issues for this particular 
intervention. As with any invasive procedure, there is some variability in patient preferences . Some 
patients prefer to avoid needle -based interventions while others would prefer a passive treatment (e.g. , 
injection) over more time -intensive self -care. There are groups of responders who realize  short - or 
intermediate -term benefit for pain and/or function, and request repeat injections as part of their long -
term pain management strategy. Additionally, this intervention may provide sho rt-term benefit for 
patients not eligible for surgery and may choose to undergo repeat injections.  
The Work Group systematically reviewed evidence related to this recommendation ( 205- 209) and 
considered the assessment of the evidence put forth in the 2017 VA/DoD LBP CPG. (199)  Therefore, this  is  a 
Reviewed, New -replaced recommendation. The Work Group’s confidence in the qua lity of the evidence 
was low. The body of evidence had some limitations including being limited to only one SR (205) 
comparing epidural steroids to non- injection- based treatment, whereas the other studies compared 
injections of steroid to injection of anesthetic or saline into the epidural space , which are not inert 
substances . Additionally, some studies assessed outcomes at or beyond 6 months, which is inconsistent 
with the clinical utilization and expected duration of benefit of ESIs for short -term improvements in pain 
and function, typically on the order of 8 – 12 weeks. Because of this, the Work Group felt that the 2017 
recommendation regarding epidurals for the long -term reduction in pain was not relevant and should be 
deleted. The potential harms of ESIs  were not systematically reviewed in the included studies. However , 
ESIs are an invasive procedure , and therefore , the Work Group determined that the  potential harms  from 
an invasive procedure  slightly outweigh the inconsistent reduction of pain at three months. Patient values 
and preferences var y because  some patients prefer to avoid needle -based interventions while others 
would prefer a passive treatment (e.g. , injection) over more time -intensive self -care. Thus, the Work 
Group decided upon a Neither for nor against  recommendation.   VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Low Back Pain  
February 2022   Page 71 of 141 Recommendation  
38. For patients with low back pain, we suggest  against spinal cord stimulation.bb  
(Weak against  | Reviewed, New -added) 
Discussion  
Evidence from a single RCT (n=218) suggests spinal cord stimulation (SCS) results in statistically significant 
but not clinically meaningful improvements in the outcomes of pain, leg pain, and health- related QoL in 
patients with predominant LBP after spinal surgery. (210) No other studies m et the search criteria for this 
evidence review, and the 2017 VA/DoD LBP CPG did not evaluate the effectiveness of SCS.  
There is likely significant variability regarding patients choosing to pursue a surgical procedure that 
involves undergoing a multi -day trial with implanted  leads  and potentially undergoing surgery to implant a 
device  if the trial lead implantation is deemed successful. This variability is further impacted by the subset 
of patients who have already undergone spinal surgery with pain that continues to persist. Within this 
subset of post -surgical patients, some are hesitant for any intervention that involves surgery while other 
patients are willing to pursue invasive treatments with the hope of pain reduction.  
The Work Group systematically r eviewed evidence related to this recommendation. (210) Therefore, this is 
a Reviewed, New -added recommendation. The Work Group’s confidence in the quality of the evidence 
was low. The body of evidence had limitations including being limited to  a single RCT with a small sample 
size with  intermediate -term follow -up of six months  and outcomes for pain, leg pain, and QoL, which were 
not clinically meaningful.( 210) The harms of SCS, such as serious AE s we re not assessed in the included 
study. Despite the lack of specific outcomes for harms, the Work Group determined  that the potential 
harms  and burdens  of the two -part surgical procedure (trial followed by implant) outweighed the 
statistically significant, but not clinically meaningful , medium -term (not beyond six months assessed in the 
included study) improvements in the outcomes of pain, leg pain, and health- related QoL seen in the 
RCT. (210) Values and preferences were varied because some patients would prefer to avoid further 
surgical procedures or a multi -step invasive procedure such as SCS, while other patients and providers may 
consider this treatment in those patients who have failed less invasive  evidence -based treatments  or are 
not candidates for spinal surgery.  Thus, the Work Group decided upon a Weak  against  recommendation.  
 
bb  Recommendations for “patients with low back pain” encompass patient populations with acute, subacute, or chronic LBP with

Reco mmendation
39.For patients with chronic low back pain, we suggest a multidisciplinary or interdisciplinary 
program. These programs should include at least one physical component and at least one other
component of the biopsychosocial model (psychological, soc ial, and/or  occupational) used in an 
explicitly coordinated manner .
(Weak for | Reviewed, Amended )
Discussion  
According to the available evidence, a multidisciplinary biopsychosocial rehabilitation (MBR)  approach that 
targets physical and behavioral/ psychological care is  beneficial for patients with chronic LBP. MBR 
treatment programs may be most appropriate for patients with severe or complex chronic LBP due to their intensity and significant time and resource commitment from both the patient and healthcare staff. (211) 
Studies examining these programs recognize their varying constitution. The available evidence provided no consensus regarding the definition of a multidisciplinary treatment approach.( 211) The term 
interdisciplinary was used interchangeably in some cases, but multidisciplinary was most consistently used to describe a team approach for treating patients with chronic LBP (see the glossary in Appendix F  for the 
definition of a multidisciplinary or interdisciplinary program).  Neither term was consistently defined in the 
literature reviewed.  While there was some variation in the interventions for MBR, the evidence reviewed 
consistently demonstrated a physical activation component  (e.g., PT, exercise, physical activity)  in addition 
to at least one other biopsychosocial -based intervention (e.g. , education, psychological and/or behavioral 
interventions) with involvement of providers from at least 2 different disciplines .  
The current systematic evidence review  included one SR  (212) and four RCTs .(213- 216) An SR from Casey 
et al. (2020) compared MBR to treatments that included physical act ivation (exercise or physical activity)  
and/or physical activation in addition to passive interventions  (e.g., manual therapies, electrotherapy, 
acupuncture)  for patients with chronic LBP and found results related to the critical outcomes of both pain 
and disability to be statistically significant in favor of MBR.  The outcomes for pain intensity had a small 
effect size at both three and 12 months  (SMD: -0.47 at both intervals)  while  outcomes for disability had a 
moderate effect size at three  months  (SMD: -0.52)  and large effect size at 12 months (SMD: -0.82). (212) 
Two RCTs (n=165)  from Schmidt et al. (2020 and 2021) compared two different delivery methods for their 
MBR for patients with chronic LBP.  The authors compared the delivery of the same program content in a 
four week intensive inpatient program with a blended program involving two weeks at home and two 
weeks of inpatient care , followed by two, 2 -day inpatient booster sessions (eight weeks and 14 weeks).  
While they did not find any difference between the two methods at any time interval, they found a small 
but not clinically important improvement in pain for both groups at 26 weeks and one year after 
treatment , as well as a  clinically meaningful  improvement  in disability at both time intervals. (213, 214) In 
another RCT (n=197), Tavafian et al. (2017) demonstrated a statistically significant long -term (30 months) 
improvement in both disability and SF -36 mental health domain measures compared to controls for 
patients with chronic LBP who participated in MBR. (216) No difference was noted in the SF -36 domains 
related to physical function, role  physical/emotional, bodily pain, general health, vitality or social function 
at that same time period. Finally, an RCT (n=501)  by Mas et al. (2019) examined MBR plus usual care 
compared to usual care in patients with subacute LBP (2  – 12 weeks) and found a statistically significant  VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Low Back Pain  
February 2022   Page 73 of 141 improvement in pain at three  months and in disability at three and 12 month intervals. (215) These findings 
are consistent with the evidence cited in the  2017 VA/DoD LBP CPG. (211, 217, 218)  
There is some variability in patient preferences regarding this treatment. There is often a large time 
commitment associated with these types of programs ; however, the programs included in the current and 
previous evidence base differed in total time and format. On the whole , these programs tend to be both 
time and resource intensive . This should be factored into consideration when deciding when and with 
whom these programs are most appropriately utilized in the course of care. We do not have data to 
support an optimal dosing for MBR or for where they are best implemented in a course of care. Evidence 
to date supports positive impacts of MBR on pain and disability , and further research in this area would 
improve the ability of patients and clinicians to make informed decisions about engaging in MBR. Access to this level of coordinated care may be l imited , especially in rural or underserved areas.  Additio nally, some 
patients and healthcare providers may have fixed beliefs related to LBP that may be centered around pathoanatomical models and may not be accepting of a biopsychosocial approach to care.  A concern for 
stigmatization for addressing psychosocial elements of pain may further deter patients from pursuing this form of care.  However, patients who do prefer a more holistic approach to their care and/or have tried 
multiple treatment approaches may welcome the comprehensive nature of MBR programs.  Additional 
considerations in suggesting MBR for treatment of LBP include a favorable risk to benefit ratio. The evidence indicates that MBR programs pose limited to no risk but yield significant benefit.  
The Work Group systematically reviewed evidence related to this recommendation ( 212- 216) and 
considered the assessment of the evidence put forth in the 2017 VA/DoD LBP CPG. (211, 217, 218)  
Therefore, this is a Reviewed, Amended  recommendation. The Work Group’s confidence in the quality of 
the evidence was very low. The body of evidence had some limitations including risk of bias, inconsistency, 
and imprecision. (212- 216) The benefits of MBR on pain and disability slightly outweighed the potential 
harms related to opportunity cost. Patient values and prefe rences were somewhat varied because of the 
time commitment and nature of the treatmen t. Thus, the Work Group decided upon a Weak for  
recommendation.  
X.  Research  Priorities   
During the development of the 2022 VA/DoD LBP CPG, the Work Group identified numerous areas for 
future research, including areas requiring stronger evidence to support current recommendations as well as research exploring new areas to guide future CPGs.  
A. Overarching Research Priorities  
• Researchers follow best practice consensus documents (such as Consolidated Standards of 
Reporting Trials  [CONSORT] for RCTs) for future studies. Many studies reviewed failed to execute 
basic quality measures such as blinding of outcome assessors, ITT analysis, and dropout and AE  
document ation.   
• Research on clinical implementation of guideline concordant practice including strategies that may help resolve conflicts between drivers of low -value intervention utilization (e.g., patient insistence 
on or specialty care referral requirements for  unnecessary diagnostic imaging or ineffective/unsafe 
treatments) and guideline concordant practice.   VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Low Back Pain  
February 2022   Page 74 of 141 •Studies that  ex amine comparative effectiveness, determination of minimum effective dose, and 
best delivery methods for current care. 
•Ev
idence on cost and risk comparisons for interventions, including cost -effectiveness per quality -
adjusted life year (QALY) or similar common measure, documentation of AE  rates and types, cost
of delivering care, and ways to reduce risk of iatrogenic harm and continued medical  care use. 
•Re
search on cost -effectiveness outcome measures that overcome limitations of QALY, which 
devalues QoL of people with chronic disabilities.
•Re
search on improving LBP outcome assessment tools that are well -defined, patient -oriented , a nd
responsive to treatment.
•Re
search on long -term outcomes greater than 12 weeks .
•Re
search on construct validity of definitions of acute, sub- acute, and chronic LBP.
•Pr
ognostic studies of large cohorts sufficiently powered to better identify valid prognostic factors 
that influence outcomes.
•St
udies to evaluate needs of optimal telehealth evaluation of patients with LBP, and validation and 
reliability studies on new telehealth technologies and evaluation protocols.
B.Low Back Pain Models
•Research on predictive modeling to help identify specific causes of LBP based on patient history 
a
nd risk factors.
•Re
search on better validation o f biological models of LBP that may better identify discrete 
“source s” of pain origin.
•Re
search on outcomes of biological models of LBP (e.g., examining the relative outcomes of 
different pain models: biological versus behavioral versus biopsychosocial).
C.Diagnostic Imaging
•Research on routine imaging and invasive diagnostic tests should focus on the economic impact of di
agnostic imaging and testing to include the amount of spending attributed to these tests and 
their subsequent referrals.
•Res
earch to determine the motives  for ordering diagnostic testing given the lack of evidence for
their utility (e. g., patient satisfaction, referral patterns/networks, health- care provider 
compensation).
•Re
search on development and validation of more widely accepted reference standards (gold 
standard) .
•Re
search to assess education and counseling of patients to enhance understanding of the benefits
and harms of performing early diagnostic testing.
D.Patient Education and Self -care
•High quality RCTs to assess the effect of pain neuroscience education and clinician- di rected
education with patient -led goal setting for t he treatment of LBP. VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Low Back Pain  
February 2022   Page 75 of 141 •Research on technology- b ased modalities for self -management that have long -term follow -up
(e.g., three months for acute LBP, and at least six to 12 months for chronic LBP) .
•Res
earch  to better understand factors  (e.g.,  diagnosis, socioe conomic status) that would influence
impact of  patient education interventions .
E.Behavioral Health Screening and Interventions
•Research on the use of the STarT Back in the U.S. and why the STarT Back has demonstrated less 
u
tility in U.S. clinics as compa red to European clinics.
•Re
search on behavioral interventions for chronic LBP including an emphasis on the optimal dose,
validation of shorter treatment protocols, and incorporation of technology to maximize access to treatment.
•
Re
search on MBSR examining which components of the treatment are most effective for patients 
with LBP. A recent SR of mindfulness -based programs for adults with psychological conditions
suggested that acceptance coupled with awareness and mindfulness meditation training may be key f actors in these treatments. (219)
•Research to better evaluate improvement in  f unctional outcomes like QoL , with CBT.
•Re
search on the comparative effectiveness of different types of CBT -CP such as ACT.
•Re
search on the comparative effectiveness of delivery settings  of behavioral interventions : virtual 
versus in -person; group versus one -on-one.
F.Non -pharmacologic Passive Treatments
•Research on passive and provider delivered t reatments (e.g. , lumbar supports, cupping, laser
therapy, TENs, ultrasound, auricular acupressure, and manipulation) pertaining to cost -
effectiveness and dose -response.
•Re
search on CIH approaches to LBP with appropriate rigor and comparators.
G.Exercise
•Evidence regarding which groups of patients may respond better to a certain exercise i
ntervention.  In addition, research on the dosing of exercise, to include duration, intensity, and 
frequency, as well as the supervision level required to help guide treatment programs.
•Re
search to better understand and identify patients’ values and preferences that make them 
better candidates for active treatment approaches such as exercise -based treatments.
H.Dietary Supplements
•High quality research on the us e of nutritional, herbal, and homeopathic supplements. 
I.Pharmacotherapy
•High quality RCTs using S NRIs  and TCAs for LBP.

LBP.
J.Non -surgical Invasive Therapies
•High quality RCTs comparing injection and needle therapies (e.g., traditional a cupuncture ,

A.Developing Key Questions  to Guide the Systematic Evidence Review
To guide this CPG’s systematic evidence review, t he Work Group drafted 12 KQs on clinical topics of the
highest priority for the VA and DoD populations . The KQs follow ed the population, intervention,
comparison, outcome, timing , and setting (PICOTS) framework, as established by the Agency for 
Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ)  (see Table A -1).

Abbreviation: PICOTS: population, intervention, comparison, outcome, timing , and setting  
Due to resource constraints, all KQs of interest to the Work Group  could not  be included in the systematic 
evidence review. Thus, the Work Group selected the 12 highest priority KQs for inclusion  in the  systematic 
evidence review (see Table A -2).  
Using the GRADE approach, the Work Group rated each outcome on a 1  – 9 scale (7  – 9, critical for 
decision making; 4  – 6, important, but not critical, for decision making; and 1  – 3, of limited importance for 
decision making). Critical and important outcomes were included in the evidence review (see Outcomes ); 
however, only critical outcomes  were used to determine the overall quality of evidence (see Determining  
Recommendation Strength and Direction ). 
a.Population(s)
The population of interest  covered in this systematic evidence review include s adults with acute, subacute, 
or chronic LBP, with or without spinal stenosis and with or without radicular pain.

B.Conducting the Systematic Review
Based on the Work Group’s decisions regarding the CPG’s scope, KQs, and PICOTS statements, the Lewin 
Team produced a systematic evidence review protocol before  conducting the review. The protocol 
detailed the KQs, PICOTS criteria, methodology to be used during the systematic evidence review, and the inclusion and exclusion criteria to be applied to each potential study, including study type and sample size. 
The Work Group reviewed and approved the protocol . 
Figure A -1 outlines the systematic evidence review’s screening process (see also the General  Criteria for 
Inclusion in Systematic Review  and Key Question Specific Criteria ). In addition,  Table  A-2 indicates the 
number of studies that addressed each of the questions.   VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Low Back Pain

ral Criteria for Inclusion in Systematic  Evidence  Review
•RCTs or SRs  publis hed on or after October 1, 2016, to February 1, 2021. If multiple SRs  address ed a
KQ, we select ed the most recent and/or comprehensive review. SRs  were supplemented with 
RCTs published after  the systematic review. 
•Studie
s must  have  been published in English.
•Public
ation must have be en a full clinica l study or SR; abstracts alone were not  included. Similarly,
letters, editorials, and other publications that were not full -length clinical studies were not
accepted as evidence.  VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Low Back Pain  
February 2022   Page 87 of 141 • Systematic reviews must  have  search ed MEDLINE  or EMBASE for eligible publica tions, performed 
a risk of bias assessment of included studies, and assessed the quality of evidence using a 
recognizable rating system, such as GRADE or something compatible (e.g., the Strength of 
Evidence grading used by the Evidence -based Practice Cente rs of the AHRQ ). If an existing review 
did not assess the overall quality of the evidence, evidence from the review must have been 
reported in a manner that allow ed us to judge the overall risk of bias, consistency, directness, and 
precision of evidence. We did not  use an exi sting review as evidence if we were unable to assess 
the overall quality of the evidence in the review.  
• Study must have enroll ed at least 50 pat ients (25 per study group for treatment studies, 50 total 
patients for diagnostic or prognosti c studies); Small sample size was  associated with increased risk 
of bias and we downgrade d small studies in the GRADE domain of precision: one downgrade for 
impre cision of a single study with &lt;200 patients per study arm.  
• Newer Cochrane reviews alread y took into account small sample  size in their estimation of risk of 
bias. In these cases, where sample size ha d already contributed to the assessment of the evidence,  
we did not downgrade those data a second time.  
• Study must have enroll ed at least 85% of patien ts who m et the study population criteria: adults 
with acute, subacute, or chronic LBP, with or without spinal stenosis and with or without radicular 
pain. For studies examining mixed patient populations, studies must have enroll ed at least 85% of 
patients with the relevant condition.  
• Study must have report ed on at least one outcome of interest.  
b. Key Question Specific Criteria  for Inclusion in Systematic Eviden ce Review  
• For all KQs, except KQ s 1 and 11, studies must have be en prospective , randomized controlled trial s 
with an independent cont rol group. Crossover trials were  not included unless they report ed data 
for the first phase of the study separately.  
• In addition to RCTs a nd systematic reviews, KQ 1  include d observational , diagnostic , and 
prognostic study designs that compared different assessment methods/tools and their diagnostic 
accuracy and impact on LBP  outcomes.  
• For KQ 11, observational studies with a relevant comparator group were  acceptable for the 
assessment part of the questi on (RCTs and SRs  were still required for the treatment part of the 
question) i f SRs and RCTs did not adequately address assessment.

d.Rating the Quality of Individual Studies and the Body of Evidence
The Lewin Team assessed the methodological risk of bias of individual diagnostic, observational, and 
interventional studies using the USPSTF method. Each study is assigned a rating of Good , Fair, or Poor  
based on a set of criteria that vary depending on study design. Detailed lists of criteria and definitions appear in Appendix VI of the USPSTF procedure manual. (221)  
Following this, the Lewin Team assessed the overall quality of the body of evidence for each critical and 
important outcome using the GRADE approach. This approach considers the  following factors: overall 
study quality (or overall risk of bias or study limitations), consistency of evidence, directness of evidence, and precision of evidence. The overall quality of the body of evidence is rated as High, Moderate , Low, and 
Very low .  
C.Developing Evidence -based Recommendations
In consultation with the VA Office of Quality and Patient Safety and the Clinical Quality Improvement 
Program , DHA , the Lewin Team convened a four -day virtual  recommendation development meeting on 
May 3 – 6, 2021 to develop this CPG’s evidence -based recommendations . Two weeks before  the meeting, 
the Lewin Team finalized the systematic evidence review and distributed the report to the Work Group; findings were also presented during the recommendation development  meeting.
Led by the Champions, the Work Group interpret ed the systematic evidence review ’s findings and 
developed this CPG’s recommendations. Where appropriate, the Work Group carried  forwa rd and 
modified  recommendations from the 2017 VA/DoD LBP CPG  as necessary (see Reconciliation of 2017 
Clinical Practice Guideline Recommendations ). The Work Group also developed new recommendations not  
included in the 2017 VA/DoD LBP CPG  based on the 2022 VA/DoD LBP CPG systematic  evidence review.  
The strength and direction of each recommendation were determined by assessing the quality of the overall evidence base, the associated benefits and harms, patient values and preferences, and other 
implications (see Determining Recommendation Strength and Direction ). 
a.Determining Recommendation Strength and Direction 
Per GRADE , each recommendation’s strength and direction is determined by the following  four 
domains :(19)   VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Low Back Pain  
February 2022   Page 89 of 141 1.Confidence in the Quality of the Evidence
Confidence in the quality of the evidence reflects the quality of the body of  evidence supporting a  
recommendation (see Rating  the Quality of Individual Studies and the Body of Evidence ). The options for 
this domain include: High , Moderate , Low, or Very l ow. This is a direct reflection of the GRADE ratings for 
each relevant critical outcome in the evidence review  (see Outcomes ). Per GRADE, if the quality of 
evidence differs across the relevant critical outcomes, the lowest quality of evidence for any of the critical 
outcomes determines the overall quality of the evidence for a recommendation. (21, 22)  
The recommendation strength generally aligns with  the confidence in the quality  of evidence . For 
example, Strong  recommendati ons are typically supported by High or Moderate  quality evidence. 
However, GRADE permits Low  or Very low  quality evidence to support a Strong  recommendation in certain  
instances  (e.g., life -threatening situation). (19) 
2.Balance of Desirable and Undesirable O utcomes
The balance of desirable and undesirable outcomes (i.e., benefits and harms) refers to the relative 
magnitudes or tradeoffs  of anticipated benefits (e.g., increased longevity, reduced morbid ity, improved 
quality of life, decreased resource use) and harms (e.g., decreased longevity, increased complications, 
impaired quality of life ). The options for this domain include: benefit s outweigh harms/burden, benefits 
slightly outweigh harms/burden, benefits and harms/burdens are balanced, harms/burdens slightly 
outweigh benefits , and harms/burdens outweigh benefits . This domain assumes most clinicians will offer 
patients an interventio n if its advantages exceed the harms . The Work Group’s understanding of the 
benefits and harms associated with the recommendation influence d the recommendation’s strength 
and direction. 
3.Patient Values and Preferences
Patient v alues and preferences is an overarching term that includes patients’ perspectives, beliefs, 
expectations, and goals for health and life  as they may apply to the intervention's potential benefits, 
harms, costs, limitations, and inconvenience . The options for this dom ain include: similar values , some 
variation , or large variation. For instance, there may be some variation  in patient values and preferences 
for a recommendation on the use of acupuncture, as some patients may dislike needles. When patient 
values seem homo geneous, this domain may increase the  recommendation’s  strength . Alternatively, when 
patient values seem heterogeneous, this domain may decreas e a recommendation’s strength.  As part of 
this domain, the Work Group considered the findings from the patient focus group carried out as part of 
this CPG update (see Appendix B).  
4.Other Implications
Other implications  encompass  the potential consequences or other impacts that might affect the strength 
or direction of the recommendation . The options for this domain include , e.g. : resource use, equity, 
acceptability, feasibility , and subgroup considerations. The following are example implications related t o 
equity  and subgroup considerations, respectively: some of the indicated population may be geographically 
remote from an intervention (e.g., complex radiological equipment) ; a drug may be contraindicated in a 
subgroup of patients.   VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Low Back Pain

b.Recommendation Categorization
A summary of the recommendation categories and definitions is available in Table 5.  
1.Categorizing Recommendations with an Updated Review of the Evidence
Reviewed  refers to  recommendations on topics included in this CPG’s systematic evidence review. 
Reviewed , New -added recommendations are original, new recommendations (i.e., not included in the 
previous CPG ). These recommendations are based entirel y on evidence included in the current CPG’s 
systematic evidence review.  
Reviewed , New -replaced recommendations were in the previous CPG  but revised  based on the updated 
evidence review. These recommendations may have clinically relevant  edits . Reviewed , Not changed 
recommendations were carried forward from the previous CPG unchanged. Reviewed , Amended 
recommendations were carried forward from the previous  CPG with a nominal change . This allowed for 
the recommendation language to reflect GRADE approach and any other not clinically meaningful  edits 
deemed necessary. These recommendations can be based on a combination of evidence included in the 
current CPG’s systematic evidence review and the evidence base that supported the recommendation in 
the previous CPG.   VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Low Back Pain  
February 2022   Page 91 of 141 Reviewed , Deleted  refers to recommendations from the previous CPG that were deleted after a review of 
the evidence. This may occur if  the evidenc e supporting the recommendation is out date d (e.g., there is no 
longer a basis to recommend use of an intervention and/or new evidence suggests a shift in care ), 
rendering the recommendation obsolete.  
2.Categorizing Recommendations without an Updated Review of the Evidence
There were also cases in which it was necessary to carry forward recommendati ons from the previous CPG 
without an updated review of the evidence. Given  time and resource  constraints, the systematic evidence 
review carried out for this  CPG update could not cover  all available evidence on LBP ; therefore, its KQs 
focused on new or updated research or areas not covered in the  previous CPG .  
For areas in which the relevant evidence was not changed and for which recommendations made in the 
previous CPG  were still relevant, recommendations could have been carried forward to the updated CPG  
without an updated review of the evidence. The evidence supporting these recommendations was thus 
also carried forward from the previous CPG. These recom mendations were categorized as Not reviewed . If 
evidence had not been reviewed, recommendations could have been categorized as Not changed, 
Amended, or Deleted . Not reviewed , Not changed recommendations were carried forward from the 
previous CPG unchanged. Not reviewed , Amended recommendations were carried forward from the 
previous  CPG with a nominal chang e. Not reviewed , Deleted  recommendations were determined by the 
Work Group to not be relevant . A recommendation may not be relevant if it, for example, pertained to a 
topic (e.g., population, care setting, treatment ) outside of the  updated CPG’s  scope  or if it was determined 
to be common practice.  
The recommendation categories for the  current  CPG  are noted in the Recommendations . The 
recommendation categories from th e 2017 VA/DoD LBP CPG are noted in Appendix D. 
D.Drafting and Finalizing the Guideline
The Work Group wrote, reviewed, and edited three drafts  of the CPG  using an iterative review process to 
solicit feedback on and mak e revisions to the CPG. T he first and second drafts were posted online  for 
20 and 14  business days , respectively,  for the Work Group  to provide feedback . Draft 3 was made availab le 
for a 14- day peer review and comment (s ee External Peer Review ). The Work Group reviewed all feedback 
submitted during each review period and made appropriate revisions to the CPG. Following the Draft 3 
review and comment period, the Work Group reviewed external feedback and created a final draft of the 
CPG. T he Champions then presented the CPG to the VA/DoD EBPWG for approval. The  Work Group 
considered the VA/DoD EBPWG’s feedback and revised the CPG  as appropriate  to create the final version . 
To accompany the CPG, the Work Group produc ed toolkit products , including  a provider summary, pocket 
card, and patient summary. The VA/DoD EBPWG approved the final CPG and toolkit products in 
February 2022.  VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Low Back Pain  
February 2022   Page 92 of 141 Appendix  B: Patient  Focus  Group  Methods  and  Findings  
A.Methods
VA and DoD Leadership recruited seven participants for the focus group, with support from the Champions
and other Work Group members as needed. While participant  recruitment focused on eliciting a range of 
perspectives likely to be relevant and informative in the CPG development process, patient focus group 
participants were not inte nded to be a representative sample of VA and DoD patients. Participants were
not incentivized for their participation or reimbursed for travel expenses.
The Work Group, with support from the Lewin  Team , identified topics on  which patient input was 
important to consider in developing the CPG . The Lewin Team developed and the Work Group approved 
and patient focus group guide covering these topics. The focus group facilitator led the discussion used the 
guide to elicit the patient s’ perspectives about their treatment and overall care. Given the limited time and 
the range of interests of the focus group participants, not all  questions were addressed.  
B.Patient Focus Group Findings
a.Participants  noted that LBP has had significant impacts on daily life, including
being unable to sit or stand for extended periods of time, requiring assistance to 
perform tasks, and experiencing other issues in addition to LBP, including pain elsewhere and behavioral  health changes (e.g., short temper, depression).
•Participants indicated that they experienced daily challenges in their lives and the workplace
r
esulting from LBP and related symptoms. 
•Pa
rticipants noted the impact of LBP on family life and that their go al for treatment is to improve
QoL and, following, prevent it from degrading. 
b.Participants expressed frustration with the lack of early evaluation (especially
use of MRIs) for determining the cause of LBP and treatment planning. 
•Participants expressed c oncerns with the lack of timely evaluation and diagnosis to understand the
cause of their LBP. 
•Pa
rticipants highlighted the importance of early evaluation with advanced imaging.
c.Participants described treatment approaches they have found to be successful,
including complementary and integrative interventions, chiropractic care and 
other non -pharmacologic approaches, and care received in pain management 
clinics. Participants shared that they often self -refer to private providers when
these interv entions are not available at VA and DoD facilities.
•Participants valued being able to choose from a variety of treatment options (e.g., medications ,
ac
upuncture, chiropractic care). 
•Pa
tients emphasized the effectiveness of non -pharmacologic approaches. Patients also noted the
helpfulness of engaging in self -care strategies for relieving LBP. 
•Pa
rticipants expressed frustration with PT and discussed the need to see k care from private
providers. VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Low Back Pain  
February 2022   Page 93 of 141 d.Participants valued communication with providers and use of a shared decision
making approach (in which the provider listened to patient problems, 
considered the underlying causes of the patient’s LBP, and explored a range of treatment options to develop an individualized treatment plan). 
•Participants appreciated providers who considered the concerns of patients in using a shared 
de
cision making approach and developing individualized treatment plans. 
•Pa
rticipants highlighted the importance of coordination between providers. 
•Pa
rticipants valued education and the  benefits of previous education in provo king meaningful
conversations.
e.Participants recognized the importance of continuity of care and 
communication between providers within and across treatment settings and
access to providers, including specialists.
•Participants noted challenges in receiving continuous care when transitioning to new providers
a
nd treatment settings. 
•Pa
rticipants expressed concern with accessing provider s.
f.Participants stated that they experienced stigma associated with having L BP
and feel that healthcare providers do not take complaints seriously. 
Participants also indicated LBP can affect military careers. 
•Participants noted stigma associated with recognizing and treating LBP and provider
di
smissiveness of patient complaints. 
•Pa
rticipants also recognized how LBP can affect military careers and prevent patients  from seeking
preventive care.  VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Low Back Pain

a  2017 Strength of Recommendation column: The 2017 VA/DoD  LBP CPG was developed using the GRADE approach to determine the strength of each recommendation. Inclusion 
of more than one 2017 strength of recommendation indicates that more than one 2017 VA/DoD LBP CPG recommendation is covered by the 2022  recommendati on. “Not 
applicable” indicates that the 2022  VA/DoD LBP  CPG recommendation was a new recommendation, and therefore does not have an associated 2017 strength of 
recommendation. “Neither for nor against” represents updated language for “N/A” used in the 2017  VA/DoD LBP CPG. 
b  Evidence column: The first set of references listed in each row in the evidence column constitutes the evidence base for the recommendation.  To be included in the evidence 
base for a recommendation, a reference needed to be identified through a systematic evidence review carried out as part of the initial development or update of this CPG. The 
second set of references in the evidence column (called “Additional References”)  includes references that provid e addition al inform ation  related t o the recommendation, but 
which were not identified through a systematic evidence review. These references were, therefore, not included in the evidence base for the recommendation and did not influence the strength and direction of the recommendation.

Category  Term  Definition  General  Acute L BP LBP present for fewer than four weeks . Som etimes grouped with subacute LBP as 
symptoms present for fewer than 12 weeks . 
Cauda equina 
syndrome  Compression on nerve roots in the lumbosacral spine, usually due to a massive, centrally herniated disc, or severe l um bar spinal stenosis  which can result in urinary 
retention or incontinence from loss of sphincter function, bilateral motor weakness of the lower extremities, and saddle anesthesia.  
Chronic LBP  LBP present for more than 12 weeks . 
Herniated disc  Herniation of the nucleus pulposus of an intervertebral disc through its fibrous outer covering, which can result in compression of adjacent nerve roots or other structures.  
Neurogenic claudication  Symptoms of leg pain (and occasionally numbness, paresthesia, or weakness) while 
walking or standing, relieved by sitting or spinal flexion . Associated with spinal 
stenosis.  
Non-radicular LBP LBP that typically does not radiate past the knee . 
Non-speci fic LBP  LBP without signs of a serious underlying condition (such as cancer, infection, or 
CES), spinal stenosis or radiculopathy, or another specific spinal cause (such as 
vertebral com pression fracture or ankylosing spondylitis). Degenerative changes on lumbar imaging are usually considered nonspecific, as they correlate poorly with symptoms.  Often called uncomplicated LBP.  
Progressive 
neurologic deficit  Abnormal finding of altered function attributable to pathology of the nerves, spinal 
cord, or brain which shows evidence of worsening with serial examination. For 
example, decreased sensation in the skin that progresses to loss of sensation or 
muscle stretch reflexes that move from diminished to absent , are example s 
of progr essive neurologic deficit . 
Radicular  LBP Pain in the back and lower limb, associated with a disorder of the spinal nerve root and/or its ganglion. This pain may or may not be accompanied by objective evidence of impaired conduction (radiculopathy).  
Radiculopathy  Refers to impaired conduction along a spinal nerve or its roots. This can be 
diagnosed by clinical exam (loss of sensation, myotatic stretch reflexes, or strength) or via electrodiagnostic testing. Radiculopathy may or may not be accompanied by radicular pain.  
Referred pain Pain that originates  from  one location  but is perceived in regions other than the 
primary site. Referred pain may have a radiating quality but does not involve stimulation of nerve roots, which differentiates it from radi cular pain.  
Sciatica  Pain along the path of the sciatic nerve. Sciatica is a symptom rather than a 
condition. Often used interchangeably with radiculopathy.  
Spinal stenosis  Narrowing of the central spinal canal or neuroforamina, usually produced by degenerative changes – a combination of facet hypertrophy, disc bulge, and 
buckling or hypertrophy of the ligamentum flavum – but may also be congenital. 
Spinal stenosis describes a pathoanatomical phenomenon and may or may not present with symptoms like neurogenic claudication.  
Straight leg r aise 
test A procedure in which the hip is flexed with the knee extended to tension the L4 -S1 
nerve roots and reproduce a patient’s lower ex tremity symptoms. A test is usually 
considered positive when the patient’s symptoms are reproduced between 30 and 
70 degrees of hip flexion. Reproduction of the patient’s symptoms on testing of the 
unaffected leg is considered a positive “crossed” straight  leg raise test.  
Subacute LBP  LBP present for greater than or equal to four weeks and less than 12 weeks.    VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Low Back Pain  
February 2022  Page 106 of 141 Category  Term  Definition  Interventions  Acupuncture  An intervention consisting of the insertion of needles at strategic points on a body . 
Back school  An intervention consisting of education and a skills program, including exercise 
therapy, in which all lessons are given to groups of patients and supervised by a healthcare professional . 
Clinician -directed 
exercis e  A supervised exercise program or forma l home exercise regimen, ranging from 
programs aimed at general physical fitness or aerobic exercise to programs aimed at muscle strengthening, flexibility, or a combination of the two . 
CBT An intervention that involves examining and changing cognitions and behaviors that perpetuate pain and  using relaxation and exposure techniques to reduce sym ptom -
related di stres s.  
MBSR  A structured intervention based on mindfulness (i.e., attending to the present 
moment, without judgment) with components of relaxation and meditation.  
Motor control exercis e  A form of rehabilitative exercise that aims to restore coordinated and efficient use of the muscles that control and support the spine . Patients are initially guided to 
practice norm al use of the muscles during simple tasks. As the patient's skill increases the exercises are progressed to more complex and functional tasks.  
Multidisciplinary or interdisciplinary program  An intervention that combines and coordinates physical, vocational, and 
behavioral/psychological components and is provided by multiple healthcare 
professionals with different clinical backgrounds. The intensity and content of the 
program varies widely. Inter disciplinary emphasizes collaboration among providers 
from different disciplines in implementing a joint treatment plan.  
Pilates  A system of exercise focusing on the relationship between stability and mobility 
designed to improve physical strength, flexi bility, and posture.  
Progressive relaxation  A technique that involves the deliberate tensing and relax ing of muscles to facilitate 
the recognition and release of muscle tension.  
Qi gong  An ancient Chinese healing art, older than , and similar to tai chi, with a focus o n 
cultivating the body’s vital energy , or qi. It involves the coordination of the breath, 
posture, awareness, visualization, and focused movements. Qi  gong may be a 
stationary or moving meditation.  
Self-care 
education materials  Reading material (e.g., books, leaflets) that provide education and self -care advice 
for patients with LBP. Although the specific content varies, self -care materials are 
generally based on principles from published CPGs and encourage a return to 
normal activity, adoption of a fitness program, appropriate lifestyle modification, 
and provide advice on coping strategies and managing flares.  
Self-care options  Interventions that can be readily implemented by patients without seeing a clinician 
or that can be implemented based on  advice provided at a routine clinic visit.  
Spinal mobilization/ manipulation  Spinal mobilization is a low -velocity technique that does not involve a thrust and is 
performed within the joint’s natural range of motion.  Manual therapy in which a 
high -velocity, low -amplitude thrust is applied to the spine to reduce pain and 
improve quality and range of motion .  
Tai chi  A form of stylized, meditative exercise, characterized by methodically slow circular stretching movements and positions of bodily balance.  
TENS  Use of a small, battery -operated device to provide continuous electrical impulses 
via surface electrodes to provide  symptom atic relief by modifying pain perception.  
Yoga  An intervention distinguished from traditional exercise therapy by the use of specific body positions, breathing techniques, and an emphasis on mental focus. Many styles of yoga exist , each emphasizing different postures and techniques.

The following outline narratively describes the Diagnosis and Treatment of Low Back Pain  algorithm . An 
explanation of the purpose of the algorithm and description of the various shapes used within the 
algorithm can be found in the  Algorithm  section. The sidebars referenced within this outline can also be 
found in the Algorithm  section.  
A. Module A: Initial Evaluation of Low Back Pain  
1. Module A begins with Box 1, in the shape of a rounded rectangle: “Adult patient with LBP”  
2. Box 1 connects to Box 2, in the shape of a rectangle: “Perform a focused history and physical examination, evaluating: Duration of symptoms ; Red flags for potentially serious conditions ; 
Presence and severity of radiculopathy and/or neurologic deficits ; Psychosocial risk factors (see 
Recommendation 4 ) 
3. Box 2 connects to Box 3, in the shape of a hexagon, which asks the question: “Are there 
progressive or otherwise serious neurologic deficits or other red flags (e.g., signs, symptoms, 
history) for serious conditions? (See Sidebars 1  and 2)” 
a. If the answer is “Yes” to Box 3, then conti nue to Box 4, in the shape of a rectangle: 
“Perform appropriate evaluation for serious conditions (see Sidebar 1  and 
Recommendations 1  – 3)”  
i. Box 4 connects to B ox 5, in the shape of a hexagon, which asks the question: “Are 
serious conditions identified?”  
1. If the answer is “Yes” to Box 5, then  continue to  Box 6, in the shape of a 
rectangle: “Address any serious conditions as indicated; consider specialty consultation”  
2. If the answer is “No” to Box 5, then continue to Box 7, in the shape of a 
hexagon , which asks the question: “Is back pain chronic ( ≥3 months )?” 
b. If the answer is “No” to Box 3, then  continue to  Box 7 , in the shape of a hexagon, which 
asks the question: “Is back pain chronic ≥3 months?”  
i. If the answer is “Yes” to Box 7, then continue to Box 8, in the shape of a hexagon, 
which asks the question: “ Has the patient had appropriate treatment?”  
1. If the answer is “Yes” to Box 8, then continue to Box 9, in the shape of an 
oval: “Go to Module B , Box 18  (assess treatment response)”  
2. If the answer is “No” to Box 8, then continue to Box 10, in the shape of a 
rectangle : “Engage the patient in a shared decision making process to 
develop individualized care plan:  Advise about self care ; Discuss non-
invasive treatment options:  Pharmacologic , Non-pharmacologic , Wa t chful 
waiting ; Arrive at shared decision regarding tr eatment”  
ii. If the answer is “No” to Box 7, then continue to Box 10 , in the shape of a 
rectangle: “Engage the patient in a shared decision making process to develop individualized care plan: Advise about self care; Discuss non- invasive treatment  VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Low Back Pain

decision regarding treatment”  
4. Box 10 connects to Box 11, in the shape of a hexagon, which asks the question: “Did the patient 
choose pharmacologic and/or non -pharmacologic treatment?”  
a. If the answer is “Yes” to Box 11, then  continue to  Box 12, in the shape of a hexagon, which 
asks the question: “Is the patient on treatment?”  
i. If the answer is “Yes” to Box 12, then  continue to  Box 13, in the shape of an oval: 
“Go to Module B , Box 18  (assess treat ment response)”  
ii. If the answer is “No” to Box 12, then  continue to  Box 14, in the shape of an oval: 
“Go to Module B , Box 16  (untreated LBP)”  
b. If the answer is “No” to Box 11, then continue to Box 15, in the shape of a rectangle: 
“Continue self-care; reassess in primary care as appropriate”  
B. Module B: Management of Low Back Pain  
1. Module B begins with Box 16 in the shape of a rounded rectangle: “LBP patient  not on treatment”  
2. Box 16 connects to Box 17, in the shape of a rectangle: “Initiate t reatment (see Sidebar 3 )” 
3. Box 17 connects to Box 18, in the shape of a rectangle: “Assess response as appropriate”  
4. Box 18 connects to Box 19, in the shape of a hexagon, which asks the question: “Was the back pain 
improved or resolved?”
