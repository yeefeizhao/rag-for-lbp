AbstractBackground: A paradigm shift away from clinician-led management of people with chronic disor-
ders to people playing a key role in their own care has been advocated. At the same time, good
health is recognised as the ability to adapt to changing life circumstances and to self-manage.
Under this paradigm, successful management of persistent back pain is not mainly about clini-cians diagnosing and curing patients, but rather about a partnership where clinicians help indi-
viduals live good lives despite back pain.
Objective: In this paper , we discuss why there is a need for clinicians to engage in supporting
self-management for people with persistent back pain and which actions clinicians can take to
integrate self-management support in their care for people with back pain.
Discussion: People with low back pain (LBP) self-manage their pain most of the time. Therefore,
clinicians and health systems should empower them to do it well and provide knowledge and
skills to make good decisions related to LBP and general health. Self-management does not
mean that people are alone and without health care, rather it empowers people to know whento consult for diagnostic assessment, symptom relief, or advice. A shift in health care paradigmand clinicians ’roles is not only challenging for individual clinicians, it requires organisational
support in clinical settings and health systems. Currently, there is no clear evidence showing
how exactly LBP self-management is most effectively supported in clinical practice, but coreelements have been identi ﬁed that involve working with cognitions related to pain, behaviour
change, and patient autonomy.

 management where people with chronic conditions play a
key role in their own care is advocated.1,2At the same time,
good health is increasingly understood as the ability to adapt
to changing life circumstances and to self-manage in the
face of social, physical, and emotional challenges.3,4In the
case of persistent low back pain (LBP), such an approach
implies that successful interventions are not mainly about
clinicians diagnosing and curing patients, but about a part-nership between individuals and clinicians that helps people
engaging in valued activities.
5Thus, living with persistent or
recurrent LBP may involve care-seeking, but people managetheir health conditions outside the context of health care
most of the time, and interventions for persistent LBP should
enable them to do that well.
In this paper, we discuss self-management in relation to
LBP with a focus on the role of the clinician.
Self-management terms
Among clinicians and within the literature, terms like self-care,self-management, self-ef ﬁcacy, and symptom management areoften used interchangeably without clear de ﬁnitions and with-
out presentation of the underlying theory.6,7Therefore, we
brieﬂy introduce how we use these terms ( Fig. 1 ).
Self-care is all the actions that people do to stay healthy
(e.g. brushing teeth, sleeping well, eating healthy food),and includes actions that aim to prevent disease, maintain
good health, and coping with illness and disability.
8
Self-management has been de ﬁned as “the individual ’s abil-
ity to manage the symptoms, treatment, physical and psy-
chological consequences, and lifestyle changes inherent in
living with a chronic condition, ”and is the part of self-care
that relates to dealing with health conditions.9/C011Deﬁnitions
of self-management emphasize the importance of interac-
tive, collaborative care between patient and healthcare pro-fessionals allowing for patient empowerment rather thanone-way passive care from expert to patient.
10/C012Symptom
management is the actions initiated by the patient, a clini-
cian, or both to decrease the distress and consequencescaused by symptoms. It entails a collaborative relationship
between a patient and the healthcare provider to make deci-
sions about for example medication or manual therapyinterventions.

397Brazilian Journal of Physical Therapy 25 (2021) 396 /C0406 Self-care and self-management are concepts with ties to
Orem ’s theory and Bandura 's Social Cognitive Theory on self-
efﬁcacy.13/C015Self-ef ﬁcacy is people 's beliefs in their ability
to inﬂuence events that affect their lives. This core belief is
the foundation of human motivation, performance accom-plishments, and emotional wellbeing. Unless people believe
they can produce desired outcomes by their actions, they
have little incentive to undertake activities in the face ofdifﬁculties. Whatever factors may serve as guides and moti-
vators, they are rooted in the core belief that one can make
a difference by one 's actions.
The focus of this paper is on self-management of persistent
LBP where this involves the interaction and communication
between the healthcare provider and the patient in a clinicalencounter , and we describe the engagement of the clinician as‘self-management support ’.
9Self-management support is pro-
vided in self-management interventions de ﬁned as interven-
tions that “aim to equip patients with skills to actively
participate and take responsibility in the management of their
chronic condition to function optimally. ”12
Why should clinicians care about
self-management in LBP?
Most people who experience LBP will have recurrent epi-
sodes with pain that comes and goes.16Even patients who
recover well from an episode of LBP most likely will experi-
ence new episodes, and up to 20% of those seeking care for
LBP have persistent LBP that they need to manage more orless continuously.
16
The impact of LBP on daily activities differs substantially
between individuals for reasons that are not fully understood.However , people are more disabled from LBP when they per-
ceive their condition as frightening and out of their control
and have low pain self-ef ﬁcacy.
17Also, effective interven-
tions for persistent pain conditions work partly by in ﬂuencing
beliefs, catastrophising thoughts, fear , and pain self-
efﬁcacy.18/C021This includes interventions that are designed to
have physical effects,22,23implying that cognitions and emo-
tions are not only affected by psychological interventions.
A traditional biomedical paradigm would focus on structural
and degenerative changes in the spine that presumably explainthe patient ’s symptoms. However , these do not correlate well
with an individuals ’pain or activity limitations,
24,25although
associated with an increased risk of LBP in populations.26They
also do not inform what treatment the patient most likely will
respond to, nor do they inform the prognosis.27,28A structural
diagnosis does therefore not help patients make sense of theirsymptoms, and it may, in fact, add to their fear and worry, andeven drive the use of ineffective treatments.
29/C033Although
exercises are often prescribed t o improve muscle function and
mobility there is little evidence that those are the mechanismsbehind positive clinical effects.
34/C036
Clinicians should care about self-management because
most people with LBP continuously manage their conditionand should be enabled to do it well. Supporting self-ef ﬁcacy
is an important element of LBP care because people are less
disabled by LBP if they trust in their ability to manage it,and effective treatments for LBP partly work by reducingfear and increasing self-ef ﬁcacy.How can clinicians integrate self-management
support in LBP management?
Clinical guidelines generally recommend advice and informa-
tion, manual therapy , and supervised exercises as treatmentsfor persistent LBP .
37-39These interventions are effective parts
of symptom management and may prevent relapse, but do
not necessarily support patient autonomy and self-manage-ment. Below, we outline clinical actions that help integrate
self-management support in LBP management including
behaviour change techniques (i.e. strategies to help patientsadopt healthy behaviours) that are frequently incorporated in
self-management interventions, and actions to focus on
patient autonomy and self-ef ﬁcacy ( Table 1 ).
12,40/C042These
actions are aligned with intervention planning, interventiondelivery , and clinical evaluation ( Fig. 2 ).
Self-management: planning
Let patients ’value-based goals direct care
Individual goal setting, such as the ‘SMART ’(Speci ﬁc Measur-
able Achievable Realistic Time-bound) method, helpspatients identify their motivation for change, increaseadherence to their plan, and helps clinicians plan interven-
tions that support these goals.
43Value-based goal setting
can open the communication about people ’s motivation for
change and can reveal what facilitates and hinders reaching
these goals.44For example, it could be an underlying prem-
ise for a patient that the pain needs to be reduced for thepatient to engage in valued activities. Through dialogue and
reﬂections, the patient may, however , realise that pain
beliefs or emotions are more central barriers for activitythan the pain itself. Therefore, goals that relate directly topain such as “I want to get rid of my back pain ”, may lead to
stress and frustration instead of action and obstruct patients
from pursuing other and more valued goals.
45
Make shared decisions
Intervention planning and goal setting should optimally bebased upon a shared decision-making process betweenpatient and clinician. This process aims at balancing the
patients ’right to autonomy with the clinicians ’responsibil-
ity to protect patients ’safety and ensure best-evidence
care. For a shared-decision process to take place, the ﬁrst
requirement is to make it explicit that a decision has to be
made.
46Thus, patients should know that there are different
options and should be provided with best-evidence informa-
tion that will help them make an informed decision on what
their preference is. Shared decision making is part ofpatient-centred care and a way to increase engagement,
patient satisfaction, and adherence.
47Shared decision-mak-
ing is, however , challenging to implement in practice andrequires that clinicians are well-informed about a patients ’
options for care and have strong communication skills.
48
Deﬁne readiness to change
Because change does not happen at once and has to be
driven by patient engagement, the patient ’s readiness to

399Brazilian Journal of Physical Therapy 25 (2021) 396 /C0406 change their behaviour needs consideration to de ﬁne
achievable and realistic goals and action plans. For this pur-
pose, ﬁve stages of behavioural change have been proposed:
Precontemplation (unawareness or denial with no intention
of changing behaviours), Contemplation (ambivalent about
possibilities to change), Preparation (action planning, startchanging behaviour), Action (changing behaviours, usingself-management strategies but not adopted as a new
habit), and Maintenance (consolidating new behaviour and
self-management strategies in everyday life).
47,48Patients
in the ﬁrst 2 or 3 stages may need more information and edu-
cation, whereas those in the last stages may need reassur-
ance and positive feedback.
Self-management support can be integrated into inter-
vention planning by letting patient value-based goals and a
focus on behaviour change direct management while shift-ing focus away from structure, pain, and impairments.
Self-management: delivery
Help patients make sense of their symptoms
Although empirical evidence is sparse, changing LBP
related behaviours seems intimately related to changing
beliefs.49/C051Patients perceive LBP as unpredictable and
uncontrollable and dif ﬁcult to make sense of, which hampers
their ability to deal with it in an expedient way.31Educating
patients about pain mechanisms and management may there-fore prevent them from restricting their valued activitiesbecause of misbeliefs and fears. There are many useful paineducation resources directed at clinicians and people with
pain (see references for suggested readings, videos, podcasts
and web sites52/C063), however , there is also a lot of misinfor-
mation about LBP .64Therefore, clinicians should direct
patients to suitable sources of information where inappropri-
ate messages and pain education using terminology relatingto spinal instability, postural abnormalities, wear and tear ,discs “popping ”in and out, or restrictions on what patients
are‘allowed ’to do or not are avoided.
Teach problem-solving skills
Supervised exercises can be used as a tool to practice prob-
lem-solving skills.65,66When patients experience pain
during an exercise, dif ﬁculties in performing desired move-
ments, or fear about their consequences, the clinician hasan opportunity to explore their thoughts about causes and
consequences by encouraging patients to experiment with
moving in different ways. Exercises then become behaviou-ral experiments that help patients reframe their beliefs andemotions related to activity. Traditionally, however , clini-
cians often correct patients when they perform exercises,
based on the assumption that bene ﬁts of exercises depend
on performing movements in very speci ﬁc ways, when in
fact there is little evidence to support that the way exer-
cises are performed relates to outcomes. Importantly, cor-recting patients carry a risk of decreasing self-management
skills by communicating that exercising is dif ﬁcult and
potentially unsafe to do on your own. Thus patients may loseautonomy and self-ef ﬁcacy and become fearful of doing
something “wrong ”or potentially harm themselves.

delivery, and evaluation, and places demands on clinicians and organisations.
400A. Kongsted, I. Ris, P . Kjaer et al. Set patients up for successful experiences
Re-engaging in valued activities may involve exposure to
movements and activities that have been avoided. Here,
graded exposure ensuring that progression feels safe or togradually increase physical performance can be helpful. Ifexposure is a tool to reframe beliefs about consequences, it
should include exposures to tasks, postures, or movements
that have been avoided.
51This exposure is an opportunity to
provide a positive experience and increase the patient ’s
beliefs in their ability to move and be active. Operant condi-
tioning principles, stating that pain behaviour is reinforcedif these behaviours result in pain reduction or positive atten-
tion from others, can also be used to reinforce healthy
behaviour by increasing activity gradually in a time-contin-gent manner.
67/C069Using operant conditioning, activity, or
exercises should not be directed by pain as this would rein-
force withdrawal from activity.
Provide tools to manage pain and emotions
Living with LBP invariably involves episodes of ﬂare-ups and
situations with increased pain. Therefore, patients need a
‘toolbox ’for managing pain and related fears or other emo-
tions which includes tools such as distraction and breathingexercises,
70mindfulness techniques,71,72or walking.72
Self-management support is integrated into the delivery
of the intervention when clinicians help patients makingsense of their symptoms, discuss pain behaviours, and avoid
supporting negative beliefs. Clinicians can use active inter-
ventions to teach problem-solving skills and providepatients with insights and tools to better manage their painand overcome obstacles encountered in everyday life.Self-management: evaluation
Evaluate goals and patients ’understanding of
back pain
Re-assessment and re ﬂection are necessary to evaluate
treatment outcomes and for clinicians ’ongoing learning pro-
cess, and therefore an integrated part of health care. Evalu-ation of patients ’progress must be aligned with the
intention of care, so the evaluation of self-management
interventions should include assessment of patients ’under-
standing of their symptoms as well as achievements ofpatients ’individual goals and discussion about strategies
and needs for adjusting these.
Assist patients in action planning
The patient should be encouraged to make an action plan for
dealing with future challenges and relapses. Here, patients ’
stage of change of behaviour should be evaluated and the
action planning related to this.
Clinicians support self-management by evaluating
patient valued goals, action plans, and phase of change
instead of de ﬁning success as a cure of symptoms.
Pre-requisites
Integrating self-management support into routine care
requires organisational support ( Fig. 2 ). First, clinicians need
training in communication skills, behavioural change techni-
ques, and in working with patient-centred care as this is
often not a part of their basic training.73Then, there is a
need for a practical clinical set-up that allows for self-man-agement support including having suf ﬁcient time for dialogueTable 2 Turning clinical activities and treatment into self-management support.
Do... Don ’t...
Planning De ﬁning success Support and guide patients towards
their individual value-based goals.Communicate that cure of symptoms is
the ultimate goal of treatment.
Clinical assessment Assess (pain) behaviours, impair-
ments, thoughts, and feelings that
facilitate and hinder valued goals.Emphasize a structural diagnosis that
does not inform choice of treatment and
prognosis, or understanding of pain.
Intervention plan Provide evidence-based knowledge
to help patients make informed
decisions about their care.Decide what is best for a patient or make
them believe that their pain will be cured
and never return.
Delivery Patient education Focus on the benign aspect of low
back pain.Focus on structural injury as an explana-
tion of non-speci ﬁc low back pain.
Manual therapy Include manual therapy in symp-
tom management if valued bypatients and helpful for achieving
patient-valued goals.Tell patients that their back pain cannot
improve without manual therapy, thatsomething is out of place or that manual
treatment corrects spinal abnormalities.
Exercise supervision Use exercises to help people
become con ﬁdent with natural and
varied movements and use exer-
cises to develop problem-solvingskills.Tell patients that their back pain cannot
improve without speci ﬁc exercises, and
don’t make movement dif ﬁcult by cor-
recting them to achieve a ‘neutral pos-
ture ’,‘alignment ’, or other clinician
determined criteria for moving correctly.
Evaluation De ﬁne success of intervention Use patient-centred goals to de ﬁne
results of the intervention.Use pain measurements to de ﬁne results
of the intervention.

on patient education and on promoting behaviour change.
74
Notably, shifting the paradigm of care requires that clini-
cians are open to thinking differently about LBP care
throughout the clinical encounter. Table 2 lists some “dos
and don ’ts”illustrating that translating treatment into self-
management support may require profound shifts in clinical
cognition and habits.
Self-management support requires organisational change
and support from payers, educators, and clinic owners.
What is the evidence for self-management
interventions in people with LBP?
Systematic reviews summarizing the evidence for the effec-
tiveness of self-management interventions in people with per-
sistent LBP report that there is considerable heterogeneity
between studies and that the methodological quality is gener-ally low to moderate. Nonetheless, across randomized clinicaltrials, interventions to promote self-management are gener-
ally found to have small to moderate effects on key clinical
outcomes such as pain intensity, back-related disability, andself-ef ﬁcacy at least up to one year post-intervention.
40,75/C077
Du et al.40identi ﬁed core elements of self-management
interventions across trials that included problem-solvingskills, decision making, resource utilization, a focus on thepatient-clinician relationship, goal setting, and activityplanning. They further found that generally, self-manage-ment interventions based on a theory, for example, the
fear-avoidance theory, or delivered according to a theory,
for example, cognitive behavioural therapy or social cogni-tive theory, were more effective than interventions that
were not based on or delivered according to a theoretical
framework; that interventions of shorter duration ( &lt;6
weeks
40or/C208 weeks78) tended to be more effective than
longer-lasting interventions; and that interventions where
the whole or parts of the intervention was delivered overthe internet or other eHealth platform were as effective as
interventions delivered in person.
40Interventions delivered
over mobile devices seemed superior to interventions deliv-ered over the internet via web-pages, but these types ofdelivery had not been directly compared. There were also
no trials directly comparing eHealth delivery to person deliv-
ery of identical self-management interventions.
78There is a
lack of evidence to tell if self-management is best supported
by individual or group-based interventions. A systematic
review found group-based interventions for LBP to be moreeffective than other types of care for pain relief,
79whereas
individual cognitive functional therapy for people with
chronic LBP was more effective in reducing disability thangroup-based exercise and education in a recent trial.
80
Despite a growing body of literature, most interventions
aiming to promote self-management in people with LBP are
not well described in reports. These interventions are oftenmultifaceted and complex, so standardised reporting, for
example according to the Criteria for Reporting the

402A. Kongsted, I. Ris, P . Kjaer et al. Development and Evaluation of Complex Interventions in
healthcare (CReDECI), should be adopted.81In addition,
authors generally report on clinical outcomes such as pain
intensity and back-related disability, but less often on
behaviour related outcomes such as self-management skills,learning, and knowledge, which are more related to the
goals of these interventions.
40,75,82One reason for this is the
lack of valid measurements tool to capture the complexityof being able to self-manage.
Current evidence on self-management interventions for
LBP are hampered by a lack of theoretical frameworks andinterventions are often poorly described. Still, the existing
evidence suggests positive effects on a range of key out-
comes and that eHealth may have an important role to play.
LBP care does not work in isolation
Health care is just one component in a person ’s strategies to
manage their health, and people with persistent LBP veryoften have multiple chronic conditions.
83Therefore, self-
management skills beyond coping with LBP are often needed
to maintain a healthy life.
Results from 53 qualitative studies investigating patients ’
perspectives on self-management of chronic diseases dem-
onstrated that personal factors (e.g. knowledge, beliefs,and motivation), health status (including symptom severityand general health), available resources, social context
(work, family, community), and health care systems all
affect a person ’s ability to self-manage.
84Another synthesis
of qualitative studies demonstrated that it can be an
exhausting effort to maintain ongoing self-management of
LBP , and the success of this sustained process depends onindividual personal factors as well as support from clinicians,
family, and friends.
85Thus health care does not act in isola-
tion, and self-management strategies must be based on indi-vidual needs and care must be person-centred. Four
principles of person-centred care have been described by
The UK Health Foundation as: (1) affording people dignity,compassion, and respect; (2) offering coordinated care; (3)offering personalised care, and; (4) supporting people to
recognise and develop their strengths and abilities to enable
them to live an independent and ful ﬁlling life.
86
Self-management interventions should support people ’s
self-ef ﬁcacy and autonomy not only as a tool for managing
pain but rather support the ability to maintain good overallphysical and mental health. People manage very different
life situations and individual resources and contexts must
be met with compassion and respect.
Summary
People with LBP self-manage their pain most of the time.Therefore, clinicians and health systems should empower
them to do it well and provide knowledge and skills to make
good decisions related to LBP and general health ( Table 3 ).
Self-management does not mean that people are alone and
without health care, rather it empowers people to know
when to consult for diagnostic assessment, symptom relief,or advice. A shift in health care paradigm and clinicians ’
roles is not only challenging for individual clinicians, itrequires organisational support in clinical settings andhealth systems. Currently, there is no clear evidence show-ing how exactly LBP self-management is most effectively
supported in clinical practice, but core elements have been
identi ﬁed that involve working with cognitions related to
pain, behaviour change, and patient autonomy.
