Prevent Back Pain
The Basics
Take Action
The Basics
Overview
One of the best ways to prevent back pain is to keep your back muscles strong. Try these tips to help protect your back and prevent back pain:
Do muscle-strengthening and stretching exercises at least 2 days a week.
Stand and sit up straight.
Avoid heavy lifting. If you do lift something heavy, bend your knees and keep your back straight. That way, your leg muscles will do most of the work.
Aim for a healthy weight. Being overweight can strain your back. Getting regular physical activity and choosing healthy foods can help you get to and stay at a healthy weight.

There are different types of back pain.
Back pain can be acute (short-term) or chronic (long-term). It can feel like a sudden, sharp pain or a dull, constant ache.
Acute
back pain lasts from a few days to a few weeks. It’s often caused by an accident, a fall, or lifting something that’s too heavy. Acute back pain usually gets better on its own — but there may be times when you need to get medical care.
Find out when to call a doctor or nurse about back pain
.
Chronic
back pain lasts for more than 3 months. It’s much less common than acute back pain. Most chronic back pain can be treated without surgery.

Am I at Risk?
Who gets back pain?
Most people have back pain at some point in their lives. It’s one of the most common medical problems. Many people hurt their backs when they lift, push, or pull something that's too heavy. You’re more likely to experience back pain as you get older.
You may also be at risk for back pain if you:
Are pregnant
Have poor posture (don’t stand and sit up straight)
Aren’t physically active
Are overweight
Fall or have an accident
Have a health problem that can cause back pain (like arthritis or cancer)
Smoke

Prevent Injuries
Focus on good posture.
Good posture can help prevent back pain.
Try not to slouch when standing and sitting
Sit up straight with your back against the back of your chair and your feet flat on the floor — if possible, keep your knees slightly higher than your hips
Stand tall with your head up and shoulders back
If you can, switch between standing and sitting so you’re not in the same position for too long
Lift correctly.
Lift things with your legs, not your back. Keep your back straight and bend at your knees. Get help if the load is too heavy for you to lift alone.

.
Prevent back injuries if you sit a lot.
If you sit a lot — like if you work at a desk — it’s important to take care of your back. Take regular breaks from sitting if you can.

Healthy Habits
Aim for a healthy weight.
Getting to and staying at a healthy weight lowers your risk of back pain. If you’re overweight, losing weight in a healthy way can lower the strain on your back.

Get enough calcium and vitamin D.
Getting enough calcium and vitamin D can help keep your bones strong and prevent osteoporosis. Osteoporosis makes your bones weaker and more likely to fracture (break) — and if it affects your spine, it can cause back pain.
