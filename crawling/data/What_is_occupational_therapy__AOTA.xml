Occupational therapists and occupational therapy assistants focus on the things you want and need to do in your daily life. Occupational therapy intervention uses everyday life activities (occupations) to promote health, well-being, and your ability to participate in the important activities in your life. This includes any meaningful activity that a person wants to accomplish, including taking care of yourself and your family, working, volunteering, going to school, among many others.
Occupational therapy services typically include:
an evaluation made just for you that lets us know your history, life experiences, and your interests. We call this your occupational profile, and it tells us what values and activities are important to you during this conversation.
an intervention plan that is unique to you to improve your ability to perform daily activities and reach your goals,
and an outcomes evaluation to make sure that the goals you set with your occupational therapy practitioner are being met.
