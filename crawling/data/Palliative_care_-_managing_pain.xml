When you have a serious illness, you may have pain. No one can look at you and know how much pain you have. Only you can feel and describe your pain. There are many treatments for pain. Tell your health care providers about your pain so that they can use the right treatment for you.
Palliative Care
Palliative care is a holistic approach to care that focuses on treating pain and symptoms and improving quality of life in people with serious illnesses and a limited life span.
When you Have Pain
Pain that is always or almost always present can lead to lack of sleep, depression, or anxiety. These can make it harder to do things or go places, and harder to enjoy life. Pain can be stressful for you and your family. But with treatment, pain can be managed.
How Pain is Measured
First, your provider will find out:
What is causing the pain
How much pain you have
What your pain feels like
What makes your pain worse
What makes your pain better
When or in what situations you have pain
You can tell your provider how much pain you have by measuring it on a scale from 0 (no pain) to 10 (the worst pain possible). You choose the number that describes how much pain you have now. You can do this before and after treatments, so you and your health care team can tell how well your treatment works.
How Pain is Treated
There are many treatments for pain. Which treatment is best for you depends on the cause and amount of your pain. Several treatments may be used at the same time for the best pain relief. These include:
Thinking about something else so you are not thinking about the pain, such as playing a game or watching TV
Mind-body therapies such as deep breathing, relaxing, or meditation
Ice packs, heating pads, biofeedback, acupuncture, or massage
You can also take medicines, such as:
Acetaminophen (Tylenol)
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
(NSAIDs) such as aspirin, naproxen (Aleve), ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), and diclofenac
Narcotics
(opioids), such as codeine, morphine, oxycodone, or fentanyl
Medicines that work on the nerves, such as gabapentin or pregabalin
What you can do
Understand your medicines, how much to take, and when to take them.
Do not take less or more medicine than prescribed.
Do not take your medicines more often.
If you are thinking about not taking a medicine, talk to your provider first. You may need to take a lower dose over time before you can stop safely.
If you have concerns about your pain medicine, talk to your provider.
If the medicine you take does not relieve your pain, a different one may help.
Side effects, such as drowsiness, may get better over time.
Other side effects, such as hard dry stools, may not spontaneously improve but can be treated. It is best to care for these issues before they become a serious problem.
Some people who take narcotics for pain become dependent on them. If you are concerned about this, talk to your provider.
When to Call the Doctor
Contact your provider if your pain is not well controlled or if you have side effects from your pain treatments.
