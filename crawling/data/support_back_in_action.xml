This book is inspired by “Back in Action, A Guide to Understanding Back Pain and Learning What To Do About It,” created by Janet 
Street, ARNP, MN, Marcia Hunt, BA, Dan Cherkin, PhD, and Richard Deyo, MD, MPH, published by Center for Health Studies, 
Group Health Cooperative ©1991. 
While the general principles of the original Back in Action book have not changed since it was published, more research has 
emerged.1 The current version of this guide is informed by new research and feedback from patients and health care providers.

2 Introduction 
Although low back with leg pain is rarely caused by a serious underlying disease, it can 
cause a lot of discomfort. It can also lead to diﬀerent feelings, like anxiousness, and can 
disrupt daily activities. Research shows that many back and leg pain suﬀerers don’t 
understand why they have pain, what they can do to get better, or how to prevent future 
back problems. This can cause people to worry instead of doing things that can help 
them get better faster. 
The information in this book is based on the latest research. Having accurate information 
can help you feel better and help you take care of your back and leg pain. 
Here are some key things to remember:  
•Most people’s low back and leg pain gets better over time. 
•Low back with leg pain is rarely caused by something serious. 
•Moving is better than not moving. Increasing activity as soon as possible can help 
you recover, even if it causes some pain. 
•You are the most important person in bringing about recovery and a return to normal 
activities. 
•Every person is diﬀerent. We will help you ﬁnd out what works best for you. 
•The purpose of this book is to give you information about your condition and what 
you can expect. It will also give you some ideas for safe and eﬀective ways to get you 
back in action ! 
3 Why me? What’s the cause? 
Why me? 
Back and leg pain problems are VERY common and almost unavoidable! About 8 out of every 10 adults 
experience back problems at some point in their lives and over half have backaches each year. Some people 
develop leg symptoms. While most people ﬁrst experience back problems in their 20s or 30s, they can begin 
at any age and for many reasons. 
What’s causing my back to hurt? 
First, it’s helpful to understand the structures of your spine. Your spine (or backbone) is a complex, ﬂexible 
column made up of many small bones called vertebrae, linked to one another by joints. Between each vertebra 
is a cushion called a disc. The vertebrae and discs are surrounded by ligaments and muscles. All of these 
structures need to work together for the spine to function properly. When they don’t, it can cause back 
problems and pain. Examples include: 
•muscle weakness 
•muscle tension or spasm 
•back sprains including ligament or muscle tears 
•joint problems 
•bulging or herniated discs 
Many people with low back problems also experience pain in their buttocks and one or both legs. When leg 
pain is caused by a problem in the back, it is called “referred pain”. This is because even though the pain is felt 
in the leg, the problem is really coming from the back. This is often due to inﬂammation or irritation in the back 
joints, muscles, or discs. Most back and leg pain is caused by this. 
Occasionally, people experience back and leg pain when the nerves that leave the spinal cord get irritated or 
pinched. This causes diﬀerent symptoms like shooting or burning pain, numbness, tingling, or weakness in the 
leg. When this happens, the leg pain is often worse than the back pain. Irritated nerves can remain sore and 
sensitive for a long time after the original injury or irritation. The good news is that this lingering pain is not a 
sign that further damage is being done to your body. 
Many people can’t pinpoint a speciﬁc event or accident that triggered their back and leg problem. It’s also very 
diﬃcult for clinicians to ﬁnd the exact cause for these types of conditions. Often, this causes people with low 
back and leg pain to worry or get frustrated. 
The good news is that very few patients with back and leg pain have a serious problem. The examination you 
had helped rule out serious disease. And even though you may not know the exact cause of your back and leg 
problem, you can do things that will help you recover. 
4 5There are several things you can do to manage your pain, even when it gets severe. Remember, even if your 
pain is really bad,  there is still a very good chance that you can get better. 
Keep Moving 
While you may not feel like moving around when you have pain, research shows that you will do better if you do 
even a small amount of activity. While you shouldn’t do anything that causes extreme pain, you also shouldn’t 
be scared of the pain either. Some pain is normal when you are trying to get back in action. The secret is ﬁnding 
activities that you feel okay doing and start slowly. 
Things you can try include: 
•Short walks, even for a couple of minutes 
•Changing positions frequently 
•Avoid sitting for long periods of time (not more than 15 to 20 minutes) 
Use heat or cold 
Heat can be helpful for managing pain and soothing tight muscles. Some people ﬁnd ice helpful for numbing 
their pain. When you feel pain in your leg, remember to apply the heat or cold to your back, since that’s where 
the problem is coming from. 
•Good sources of heat include hot water bottles, electric heating pads, microwavable grain bags, or a hot bath 
or shower. 
•Good sources of cold include an ice pack or a bag of frozen vegetables. 
•Apply heat or cold for up to 15 minutes and re-apply every few hours. Place a cloth between the heat or cold 
source and your skin to prevent damage. 
Use medications if needed 
Over-the-counter medications as you normally use them, can also be taken. These can help manage your pain. 
What can I do for my pain?  6Do I need an X-ray? 
It used to be very common for everyone with low back pain to get an x-ray. We now know that the causes of low 
back pain rarely show up on x-rays. Many x-ray ﬁndings, like degenerative disc disease, are common in people 
without back problems and are part of the natural aging process. Also, x-rays that aren’t needed may expose 
patients to unnecessary radiation. Generally, x-rays are only taken when a doctor ﬁnds speciﬁc things in the 
patient’s physical exam or health history that suggests x-rays will be useful. 
Do I need a CT scan or MRI? 
Most patients with low back and leg pain don’t need a CT scan or MRI. This is because they often ﬁnd things 
that aren’t important and are common even in people without low back pain. These tests alone can’t prove the 
cause of pain. They are only one part of an assessment that includes the examination and your symptoms. If 
your symptoms worsen signiﬁcantly, your health care provider may wish to order these tests. 
Should I be seen by a specialist? 
The health care providers you have seen are well trained to examine patients with low back and leg pain. They 
have ruled out serious underlying diseases. If your symptoms get very severe, your health care provider may 
order special tests or refer you to a specialist. 
Studies show that non-surgical care is a good option for patients with back and leg pain. Surgery should only be 
considered: 
•In emergency cases (bowel or bladder problems or numbness in the groin or rectal area). 
•In special cases with speciﬁc nerve problems that are worsening and cannot be managed by non-surgical 
treatments. 
Do I need tests or a specialist?  7Should I restrict my activity? 
Too much rest will hurt you more than it will help over the long run. If you have a severe ﬂare up, lying down for 
brief periods of time may relieve symptoms. However, too much inactivity can slow down your recovery. 
Remember to get up and walk around frequently, even if it hurts. Feeling some pain when you’re returning to 
regular activity is normal and doesn’t mean you’re harming yourself. In most cases, it’s important to get back to 
your regular activity level as soon as possible. If your regular activity seems too much, take it in small steps. Do 
what you can, when you can and gradually you will feel better. 
What about exercise? 
Regular exercise, like walking, swimming, or stationary bicycling, are excellent activities. They can help 
strengthen your back and abdominal muscles as well as your heart and lungs. These exercises can help you 
increase your endurance and energy levels. They can also help you lose extra body weight. Exercise is a good 
way to prevent your back and leg pain being a problem in the future. 
A walking program is a good place to begin. Start slowly, then gradually increase your speed and the length of 
time you walk. Wear comfortable clothing and low-heeled, lace-up shoes with cushioned soles. Once you can 
walk briskly for 30 minutes each day, you may be able to move on to more vigorous exercises. If walking 
increases your pain a lot, you may need to start slowly. You can do this by walking inside your home or your 
yard for several minutes every few hours. Activity and exercise 
 8Although it is very, very rare, some people with back and leg pain develop problems that require 
immediate medical attention. 
Be sure to contact your health care provider or go to an emergency room immediately if you are having 
trouble controlling your bowel or bladder, or if your groin or rectal area becomes numb. 
While the following are not emergency situations, you should tell your study provider if any of the 
following occur: 
•Weakness or numbness in your feet or legs. 
•Severe pain that is keeping you from sleeping and/or working. 
•Pain that is causing you a lot of worry. 
What about other treatments? 
There are several treatment options for back and leg pain conditions. Importantly , no one treatment 
has been shown to be the best.  Treatment options for back and leg pain include acupuncture, 
massage, medications, exercise, and spinal manipulation. In some cases of back and leg pain, 
especially when there has been substantial nerve damage, steroid injections or surgery may be options 
to consider. 
We ask that you don’t start new treatments for your back and leg pain during the ﬁrst 12 weeks of the 
study. If you feel you need another type of treatment, let your study provider know. When should I contact 
my provider? 
 9At work 
Work can be stressful, especially if your job makes your back and leg pain worse. It can also be diﬃcult if 
your supervisor or coworkers don’t understand your problem. Here are some tips for communicating with 
others at work about your back and leg pain. 
•Make it clear to your supervisor that although you may sometimes be limited in your activities, you wish 
to return to your normal activities as soon as possible. 
•Together, plan how you can be most useful while your back and leg pain still limits you. There are times 
where you may need to stop or modify some of your usual job-related activities until you are better. 
•Some of your coworkers may not understand the amount of pain you’re feeling. Don’t waste your time 
trying to convince them how bad the pain is. Instead, put your energy into being as productive as you 
possibly can, while being clear about what your limitations are. 
Family and friends 
People who don’t have pain may have trouble understanding how it aﬀects you and your life. You may have 
to help your family understand that it can take some time to ﬁgure out how to manage your back and leg 
pain better. 
•Discuss your treatment with your family and let them know that you want to return to normal as soon as 
possible. 
•Communicate to them that you may need to reduce some of your usual activities when you experience 
ﬂare ups. 
•Ask your family to help you by encouraging you to gradually increase your activity level every day, even if 
this increase causes you some pain. What should I tell others? 
 10Paying attention to your posture through the day can help manage 
your back and leg pain. One way to do this is to learn how to ﬁnd a 
neutral spine position. This is when the curves in your neck, 
mid-back and low back are lined up in a way that supports your 
body.  
Using a neutral spine position during your daily activities helps keep 
your back strong. It can also help you feel more comfortable. What about my posture? 
Neck 
Mid-back 
Low back Your Spine’s 3 Curves 
How do I ﬁnd my spine’s ‘neutral zone’? 
Standing 
1.Stand  with your feet a comfortable width apart; roll your shoulders back and look 
straight ahead (this will help you maintain the curves in your neck and mid-back). 
2.Tighten  your stomach muscles. 
3.Rock your pelvis backward  by slowly pulling your belly button towards your spine (it 
should feel like you are making a “C” with your spine). 
4.Release your stomach muscles. 
5.Rock your pelvis forward  by slowly pushing your belly button out in front of you (it 
should feel like you are arching your back). 
6.Repeat  rocking your pelvis backward and forward a few times; try to identify the 
range between the two positions where you feel most comfortable. This is your 
spine’s  neutral zone. 
Sitting 
1.Sit on a chair with feet ﬂat on the ﬂoor. Roll your shoulders back and look straight 
ahead. If your back is very painful, you can try rolling up a towel and placing it in the 
curve of your low back. 
2.Perform the same steps 2-6 described above for standing.  11Neutral spine 
How does keeping a neutral spine position help? 
•It gets your muscles working in a way that keeps your spine strong 
•It can help you ﬁnd a comfortable position 
•It can help you for irritating your back when you lift and do other activities 
When is it helpful to use “neutral spine”? 
•When you are doing any of your daily activities, at work, and during exercise 
•When you are experiencing back and leg pain 
•Throughout the day so your muscles learn how to ﬁnd this position more easily 
Neck 
Mid-back 
Low back 
Another way to help ﬁnd a neutral spine posture is 
to think about lining up your ears, shoulder and 
hips when you are in diﬀerent postures  12In addition to using neutral spine , here are some other tips to help you keep comfortable. 
•Driving : when driving for long periods, use a pillow or rolled-up towel behind your back and be sure to stop 
at regular intervals to walk around. 
•Sex: as long as you don’t have too much pain, sexual activity will not harm your back. In general, the partner 
with back pain may be most comfortable with ﬁrm back support. Side-lying may also be more comfortable. 
You may ﬁnd other positions that work best for your particular situation. 
•Standing:  if you need to stand in one position for a long time, put a low stool under one foot. 
•Sitting: use a ﬁrm seat and a small pillow or rolled-up towel behind the small of your back for support. Make 
sure your feet rest on the ﬂoor or on a low stool, whichever is more comfortable. Get up and move around 
frequently (every 15 or 20 minutes). 
•Lifting:  when you lift heavy things, squat down by bending your knees and keep item close to your body. 
Use the muscles in your legs to lift. 
•Smartphones and tablets: when using devices remember to keep a ‘neutral spine’ by raising them up closer 
to eye level. 
•Getting out of bed : When getting out of bed, turn onto your side, bend your knees toward your chest, then 
drop your feet over the edge of the bed as you push yourself up with your arms. 
•Sleeping : try diﬀerent sleeping positions to ﬁnd one that is most comfortable. 
•Place a small pillow under your head or no pillow at all. 
•Sleep on your back with a pillow under your knees. 
•Sleep on your side with your knees bent and a pillow between them.
