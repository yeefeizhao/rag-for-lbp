VA Research and Development Program: 
Prosthetics and Related Technology for Restoring Veterans’ Abilities 
A top priority for VA is providing state-of-the-art prosthetic care for Veterans.
Some have lost limbs from explosive blasts or other combat traumas, and others
have needed amputations because of complications from diseases such as diabetes.
To meet the lifestyle and medical needs of these Veterans who have lost the use
of a limb, specialists in the VA Research and Development program are continually
modernizing the materials and design of artificial limbs—moving toward more
lifelike performance and minimized chance of mechanical failure. 
Replacing lost limbs with more realistic and higher-functioning prostheses is 
just one way the VA Research program is helping to restore Veterans’ capabilities.
VA Research and Development specialists are working on numerous technologies
to meet the diverse needs of  Veterans with disabilities—for example, progressive
wheelchairs to restore independence, hands-free computers with voice recognition, 
artificial retinas, and modern aids to restore hearing and other senses. 
Nearly 1.5 million Veterans sought 
prosthetics-related care from VA over a recent 
one-year period. This brochure highlights the many
forms of rehabilitation that these Veterans require, 
and introduces the VA Research program’s broad 
spectrum of advances in prosthetics and related 
assistive devices to address these health care needs.

DISCOVERY      INNOVATION     ADVANCEMENT      DISCOVERY      INNOVATION     ADVANCEMENT       VA has an integrated 
delivery system to apply
the latest technologies in 
prosthetics and related 
devices for their intended 
benefit: to maximally restore
a Veteran’s quality of life. 
In a single recent year, for example, 
VA specialists provided about 150 Veterans 
with a “C-Leg,”  a sophisticated computerized 
leg that allows people with amputations above 
the knee to walk in a more natural way. 
At Walter Reed Army Medical Center, 
VA’s vocational rehabilitation and employment 
program has provided voice-recognition 
computers so OEF/OIF Veterans who have lost 
a hand can effectively use computers without 
having full typing capability.  
The goal of VA prosthetic care providers 
goes far beyond teaching a patient with an 
amputation to walk or use an artificial arm. 
Support for independent living can even 
extend to home improvements and adaptive 
equipment for the cars of Veterans with 
amputations or other service-connected 
disabilities. Long-term care and support from 
VA care teams have been shown to help some 
patients continue to improve  their functioning 
months or even years after their injuries. 
Prosthetics and Related 
Technology for Restoring 
Veterans’ Abilities 
•  Studying how to best match prosthetic 
components with the needs of amputees, 
includingthose whose active lifestyles call for
versatile, high-performance artificial limbs. 
•  Investigating different care strategies for 
residual limbs after surgery, which may
improve understanding of wound care in 
general and could ultimately reduce the need 
for amputations. Already, wound healing that
used to take weeks or even months can now 
occur far faster.  
•  Developing a family intervention program 
to teach service members’ spouses alternative
and complementary medicine techniques
shown to lessen anxiety and pain associated 
with traumatic limb loss.  
•  Evaluating CT scans of diabetic feet to
identify which foot types are at highest risk
for the ulcers that often lead to amputation.
•  Studying complex methods of tissue 
engineering for addressing tendon loss from 
military trauma or degenerative arthritis and 
for regenerating cartilage lost to trauma,
disease, or aging.
Using Electrical Signals 
to Restore Function 
More than 40,000 Veterans, and a total
of more than 250,000 Americans, have serious
spinal cord injuries and disorders that may
interfere with brain signals that control muscle
movement. Many others have become blind 
from the loss of “photoreceptors” in the eye.
For Veterans with these and some other types
of functional loss due to disease or injury, 
VA investigators hope to restore function with 
electrical currents delivered through means
of a “neural prosthesis.” Developing More Lifelike 
Artificial Limbs 
VA researchers constantly strive to improve 
the construction of prostheses, using leading-
edge technologies such as robotics, tissue 
engineering, and nanotechnology to create
lighter limbs that closely mimic their natural
counterparts. The integration ofbody, mind,
and machine is a major guiding principle as 
VA specialists design and build artificial limbs
that look, feel, and respond like natural arms
and legs. 
Important areas of VA research on amputation 
and artificial limbs include:
•  Introducing the first powered ankle-foot 
prosthesis, which thrusts users forward with 
tendon-like springs and an electric motor. 
The prototype, developed collaboratively by
VA researchers with researchers at MIT and 
Brown University, has shown important bene-
fits in early studies—among them, patients 
expended less energy during walking, had 
better balance, and walked 15 percent faster. Bruce J. Sangeorzan, M.D.,Director of the VA Center of Excellence for Limb Loss Prevention and 
Prosthetic Engineering, received the 2007 Magnuson Award—an award presented annually to a VA 
Rehabilitation Research and Development investigator who exemplifies entrepreneurship, humanitarianism,
and dedication to Veterans. Dr. Sangeorzan’s research is focused on preserving the lower limb and better
understanding the deformities that lead to foot ulcers to improve the quality of life of Veterans who might
otherwise undergo amputation.
Important areas of VA research in neural
prostheses include: 
•  Investigating the use of electrical 
stimulation, delivered by devicesimplanted 
into the body like cardiac pacemakers,
to enable Veterans with varying degrees of
spinal cord injury to improve their ability
to walk, control the movement of paralyzed 
limbs for grasping and releasing objects, and 
manage body functions such as bladder
control and respiration.  
In a study of 32 chronic stroke patients, VA 
researchers found that functional neuromuscu -
lar stimulation significantly enhanced walking
ability. The therapy, which involved delivering
small currents to electrodes implanted in 
weak or paralyzed leg muscles, outperformed 
other therapies used in the trial, such as 
body-weight-supported treadmill training 
or special walking exercises.

VA researchers and colleagues are working
toward restoring vision for Veterans with 
such conditions as macular degeneration —the 
leading cause of blindness in the industrialized 
world—by means of a microelectronic implant
in the eye. The implanted device delivers small
pulses of electricity to the retina with the goal
of restoring
some vision to
patients with 
certain forms of
retinal blindness.  
VA Prosthetics Research 
in the Real World 
To ensure that no time is lost translating VA’s
groundbreaking research into life-improving
advances in care, the VA Research and 
Development program relies on extensive
collaboration among basic science researchers,
clinician investigators, and rehabilitation 
specialists. VA has for the last several years
conducted a series of“State of the Science— 
Research to Clinical Practice” workshops in 
cooperation with the Department ofDefense
and Walter Reed Army Medical Center on 
topics such as prosthetics, spinal cord injury,
and wheelchair technology.
Upcoming workshops are announced at

Spotlight on VA Research 
In its longstanding role as
a world leader in prosthetics
research, VA’s research program 
supports a broad portfolio related 
to amputations and prosthetics. In addition to
continually developing improved materials 
and designs for prostheses, VA investigators 
are working to identify the best match for 
Veterans’ prosthetic needs by collecting 
information such as how various prosthetic 
devices are used and how satisfied users are
with each type.
Among those receiving prosthetics-related care
in the VA system are many of the estimated 
6 percent of wounded service members
returning from Iraq who have lost a limb,
and many other Veterans whose amputations
were necessitated by diabetes, peripheral
vascular disease, and other disorders. The total
number of Veterans accessing VA health care
for prosthetics, sensory aids, and related 
services has increased by more than 70 percent
since 2000.

VA Research and Development Program: 
Prosthetics and Related Technology for Restoring Veterans’ Abilities 
A top priority for VA is providing state-of-the-art prosthetic care for Veterans.
Some have lost limbs from explosive blasts or other combat traumas, and others
have needed amputations because of complications from diseases such as diabetes.
To meet the lifestyle and medical needs of these Veterans who have lost the use
of a limb, specialists in the VA Research and Development program are continually
modernizing the materials and design of artificial limbs—moving toward more
lifelike performance and minimized chance of mechanical failure. 
Replacing lost limbs with more realistic and higher-functioning prostheses is 
just one way the VA Research program is helping to restore Veterans’ capabilities.
VA Research and Development specialists are working on numerous technologies
to meet the diverse needs of  Veterans with disabilities—for example, progressive
wheelchairs to restore independence, hands-free computers with voice recognition, 
artificial retinas, and modern aids to restore hearing and other senses. 
Nearly 1.5 million Veterans sought 
prosthetics-related care from VA over a recent 
one-year period. This brochure highlights the many
forms of rehabilitation that these Veterans require, 
and introduces the VA Research program’s broad 
spectrum of advances in prosthetics and related 
assistive devices to address these health care needs.
