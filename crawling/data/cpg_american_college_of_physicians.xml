Pain: A Clinical Practice Guideline From the American College ofPhysicians
Amir Qaseem, MD, PhD, MHA; Timothy J. Wilt, MD, MPH; Robert M. McLean, MD; and Mary Ann Forciea, MD; for the Clinical
Guidelines Committee of the American College of Physicians*
Description: The American College of Physicians (ACP) devel-
oped this guideline to present the evidence and provide clinicalrecommendations on noninvasive treatment of low back pain.
Methods: Using the ACP grading system, the committee based
these recommendations on a systematic review of randomized,controlled trials and systematic reviews published through April2015 on noninvasive pharmacologic and nonpharmacologictreatmentsforlowbackpain.Updatedsearcheswereperformedthrough November 2016. Clinical outcomes evaluated includedreduction or elimination of low back pain, improvement in back-speciﬁc and overall function, improvement in health-relatedquality of life, reduction in work disability and return to work,global improvement, number of back pain episodes or time be-tween episodes, patient satisfaction, and adverse effects.
Target Audience and Patient Population: The target audi-
ence for this guideline includes all clinicians, and the target pa-tient population includes adults with acute, subacute, or chroniclow back pain.
Recommendation 1: Given that most patients with acute or
subacute low back pain improve over time regardless of treat-ment, clinicians and patients should select nonpharmacologictreatment with superﬁcial heat (moderate-quality evidence), mas-sage, acupuncture, or spinal manipulation (low-quality evidence).If pharmacologic treatment is desired, clinicians and patientsshould select nonsteroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs or skeletalmuscle relaxants (moderate-quality evidence). (Grade: strong
recommendation)
Recommendation 2: For patients with chronic low back pain,
clinicians and patients should initially select nonpharmacologictreatment with exercise, multidisciplinary rehabilitation, acupunc-ture, mindfulness-based stress reduction (moderate-quality evi-dence), tai chi, yoga, motor control exercise, progressiverelaxation, electromyography biofeedback, low-level lasertherapy, operant therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, orspinal manipulation (low-quality evidence). (Grade: strongrecommendation)
Recommendation 3: In patients with chronic low back pain who
have had an inadequate response to nonpharmacologic therapy,clinicians and patients should consider pharmacologic treatmentwith nonsteroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs as ﬁrst-line therapy, ortramadol or duloxetine as second-line therapy. Clinicians shouldonly consider opioids as an option in patients who have failed theaforementioned treatments and only if the potential beneﬁts out-weigh the risks for individual patients and after a discussion ofknown risks and realistic beneﬁts with patients. (Grade: weak rec-ommendation, moderate-quality evidence)

Low back pain is one of the most common reasons
for physician visits in the United States. Most Amer-
icans have experienced low back pain, and approxi-mately one quarter of U.S. adults reported having lowback pain lasting at least 1 day in the past 3 months (1).Low back pain is associated with high costs, including
those related to health care and indirect costs frommissedworkorreducedproductivity(2).Thetotalcostsattributable to low back pain in the United States wereestimated at $100 billion in 2006, two thirds of which
were indirect costs of lost wages and productivity (3).
Low back pain is frequently classiﬁed and treated
on the basis of symptom duration, potential cause,presence or absence of radicular symptoms, and corre-sponding anatomical or radiographic abnormalities.Acute back pain is deﬁned as lasting less than 4 weeks,subacute back pain lasts 4 to 12 weeks, and chronicback pain lasts more than 12 weeks. Radicular low backpain results in lower extremity pain, paresthesia, and/orSee also:

Mostpatientswithacutebackpainhaveself-limitedep-isodes that resolve on their own; many do not seekmedical care (4). For patients who do seek medicalcare, pain, disability, and return to work typically im-prove rapidly in the ﬁrst month (5). However, up to onethird of patients report persistent back pain of at leastmoderate intensity 1 year after an acute episode, and 1in 5 report substantial limitations in activity (6). Manynoninvasive treatment options are available for radicu-lar and nonradicular low back pain, including pharma-cologic and nonpharmacologic interventions.
GUIDELINE FOCUS AND TARGET POPULATION
ThepurposeofthisAmericanCollegeofPhysicians
(ACP) guideline is to provide treatment guidancebased on the efﬁcacy, comparative effectiveness, andsafety of noninvasive pharmacologic and nonpharma-cologic treatments for acute (&lt;4 weeks), subacute (4 to12 weeks), and chronic (&gt;12 weeks) low back pain inprimary care. This guideline does not address topicalpharmacologic therapies or epidural injection thera-pies. It serves as a partial update of the 2007 ACPguideline (it excludes evidence on diagnosis). Theserecommendations are based on 2 background evi-dencereviews(7,8)andasystematicreviewsponsoredby the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality(AHRQ) (9). The target audience for this guideline in-cludes all clinicians, and the target patient populationincludes adults with acute, subacute, or chronic lowback pain.
METHODS
Systematic Review of the Evidence
The evidence review was conducted by the
AHRQ's Paciﬁc Northwest Evidence-based PracticeCenter. Additional methodological details can befound in the Appendix (available at Annals.org) as well
as in the accompanying articles (7, 8) and full report (9).Reviewers searched several databases for studies pub-lished in English from January 2008 through April 2015and updated the search through November 2016.Studies published before 2007 were identiﬁed usingthe 2007 ACP/American Pain Society (APS) systematicreviews (10, 11). Reviewers combined data when pos-sible using meta-analysis and assessed risk of bias andstudy quality according to established methods. Thestudy population included adults (aged ≥18 years) withacute, subacute, or chronic nonradicular low back pain,radicularlowbackpain,orsymptomaticspinalstenosis.
The review evaluated pharmacologic (acetamino-
phen, nonsteroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs [NSAIDs],opioids, skeletal muscle relaxants [SMRs], benzodiaz-epines, antidepressants, antiseizure medications, andsystemic corticosteroids) and nonpharmacologic (psy-chological therapies, multidisciplinary rehabilitation,spinal manipulation, acupuncture, massage, exerciseand related therapies, and various physical modalities)treatments for low back pain. Evaluated outcomes in-cluded reduction or elimination of low back pain,
improvement in back-speciﬁc and overall function,improvement in health-related quality of life,reduction in work disability, return to work, globalimprovement, number of back pain episodes or timebetween episodes, patient satisfaction, and adverseeffects.
The magnitude of effect (small, moderate, or large)
was determined as previously described (10, 11). Asmall effect on pain was deﬁned as a mean between-group difference after treatment of 5 to 10 points on avisual analogue scale of 0 to 100 or equivalent, a meanbetween-group difference of 0.5 to 1.0 point on a nu-merical rating scale of 0 to 10, or a standardized meandifference of 0.2 to 0.5. A moderate effect was deﬁnedasameanbetween-groupdifferenceofgreaterthan10to no more than 20 points on a visual analogue scale of0 to 100 or equivalent, a mean between-group differ-ence of greater than 1.0 to no more than 2.0 points ona numerical rating scale of 0 to 10 or equivalent, or astandardized mean difference greater than 0.5 but nomore than 0.8. For function, a small effect was deﬁnedas a mean between-group difference of 5 to 10 pointson the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), a meanbetween-group difference of 1 to 2 points on the Ro-land Morris Disability Questionnaire (RDQ), or a stan-dardized mean difference of 0.2 to 0.5. A moderateeffect on function was deﬁned as a mean between-group difference of greater than 10 to no more than 20points on the ODI, a mean between-group differenceof greater than 2 to no more than 5 points on the RDQ,or a standardized mean difference greater than 0.5 butno more than 0.8. No large effects were found with anyintervention.

BENEFITS AND COMPARATIVE BENEFITS OF
PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPIES
Acute or Subacute Low Back Pain
Appendix Table 1 (available at Annals.org) summa-
rizes the ﬁndings for all therapies for acute or subacutelow back pain.
Acetaminophen
Low-quality evidence showed no difference be-
tween acetaminophen and placebo for pain intensity orfunction through 4 weeks or between acetaminophenand NSAIDs for pain intensity or likelihood of experi-encing global improvement at 3 weeks or earlier (13,14).
NSAIDs
Moderate-quality evidence showed that NSAIDs
were associated with a small improvement in pain in-tensity compared with placebo (14, 15), although sev-eralrandomized,controlledtrials(RCTs)showednodif-ference in likelihood of achieving pain relief withNSAIDs compared with placebo (16–18). Low-qualityevidence showed a small increase in function withNSAIDs compared with placebo (19). Moderate-qualityevidence showed that most head-to-head trials of oneNSAID versus another showed no differences in painrelief in patients with acute low back pain (14). Low-quality evidence showed no differences in pain be-tween cyclooxygenase (COX)-2–selective NSAIDs ver-sus traditional NSAIDs (14).
SMRs
Moderate-quality evidence showed that SMRs im-
proved short-term pain relief compared with placeboafter 2 to 4 and 5 to 7 days (20, 21). Low-quality evi-dence showed no differences between different SMRsfor any outcomes in patients with acute pain (20). Low-quality evidence showed inconsistent ﬁndings for theeffect on pain intensity with a combination of SMRsplus NSAIDs compared with NSAIDs alone (20, 22, 23).
Systemic Corticosteroids
Low-quality evidence showed no difference in pain
or function between a single intramuscular injection ofmethylprednisolone or a 5-day course of prednisolone
compared with placebo in patients with acute low backpain (24, 25).
Other Therapies
Evidence was insufﬁcient to determine effective-
ness of antidepressants, benzodiazepines (26, 27), an-tiseizure medications, or opioids versus placebo in pa-tients with acute or subacute low back pain.
Chronic Low Back Pain
Appendix Table 2 (available at Annals.org) summa-
rizes the ﬁndings for all therapies for chronic low backpain.
NSAIDs
Moderate-quality evidence showed that NSAIDs
were associated with small to moderate pain improve-ment compared with placebo (14, 28, 29). Low-qualityevidence showed that NSAIDs were associated with noto small improvement in function (28–31). Moderate-quality evidence showed that most head-to-head trialsof one NSAID versus another showed no differencesin pain relief in patients with chronic low backpain (14). There were no data on COX-2–selectiveNSAIDs.
Opioids
Moderate-qualityevidenceshowedthatstrongopi-
oids (tapentadol, morphine, hydromorphone, and oxy-morphone) were associated with a small short-term im-provementinpainscores(about1pointonapainscaleof 0 to 10) and function compared with placebo (32–36). Low-quality evidence showed that buprenorphinepatches improved short-term pain more than placeboin patients with chronic low back pain; however, theimprovement corresponded to less than 1 point on apain scale of 0 to 10 (37–40). Moderate-quality evi-dence showed no differences among different long-actingopioidsforpainorfunction(33,41–44),andlow-quality evidence showed no clear differences in painrelief between long- and short-acting opioids (45–50).Moderate-quality evidence showed that tramadolachieved moderate short-term pain relief and a smallimprovement in function compared with placebo (32,51, 52).
SMRs
Evidence comparing SMRs versus placebo was in-
sufﬁcient (53–55). Low-quality evidence showed no dif-ferences in any outcome between different SMRs fortreatment of chronic low back pain (20).
Benzodiazepines
Low-quality evidence showed that tetrazepam im-
proved pain relief at 5 to 7 days and resulted in overallCLINICAL GUIDELINE Noninvasive Treatments for Acute, Subacute, and Chronic Low Back Pain

(20).
Antidepressants
Moderate-quality evidence showed no difference
in pain between tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) or se-lective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) versus pla-cebo, and low-quality evidence showed no differencesin function for antidepressants (56). Moderate-qualityevidence showed that duloxetine was associated with asmall improvement in pain intensity and function com-pared with placebo (57–59).
Other Therapies
Evidence was insufﬁcient to determine the effect of
acetaminophen, systemic corticosteroids, or antiseizuremedications on chronic low back pain.
Radicular Low Back Pain
Appendix Table 3 (available at Annals.org) summa-
rizes the ﬁndings for all treatments for radicular lowback pain.
Benzodiazepines
Low-quality evidence showed no difference be-
tween diazepam and placebo for function at 1 weekthrough 1 year and analgesic use, return to work, orlikelihood of surgery through 1 year of follow-up in pa-tients with acute or subacute radicular pain (60). Diaze-pamresultedinalowerlikelihoodofpainimprovementat 1 week compared with placebo.
Systemic Corticosteroids
Moderate-quality evidence showed no differences
in pain between systemic corticosteroids and placeboand no to small effect on function in patients with radic-ular low back pain (61–66).
Other Therapies
No RCTs evaluated acetaminophen, SMRs, antide-
pressants, or opioids for radicular low back pain. Re-sults for NSAIDs were inconsistent for pain, andevidence was therefore insufﬁcient (22). There was in-sufﬁcient evidence to determine the effect of antisei-zure medications on radicular low back pain (67–71).
HARMS OF PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPIES
Harms were derived from the identiﬁed systematic
reviews. Adverse effects generally associated with thedrugs can be found in Appendix Table 4 (available at
Annals.org).
Moderate-quality evidence showed no difference
among scheduled acetaminophen, acetaminophentaken as needed, or placebo for serious adverse events(13). Moderate-quality evidence showed that more ad-verseeffectsoccurredwithNSAIDsthanplacebo,COX-2–selective NSAIDs were associated with a decreasedrisk for adverse effects compared with traditionalNSAIDs, and acetaminophen was associated with a
lower risk for adverse effects than NSAIDs (14).Moderate-quality evidence showed that short-term useof opioids increased nausea, dizziness, constipation,vomiting, somnolence, and dry mouth compared withplacebo,andSMRsincreasedriskforanyadverseeventand central nervous system adverse events (mostly se-dation) compared with placebo (20). Moderate-qualityevidence showed that antidepressants increased riskfor any adverse event compared with placebo, al-though rates of speciﬁc adverse events did not differ(72). The risk for serious adverse events did not differbetween duloxetine and placebo, although duloxetinewas associated with increased risk for withdrawal dueto adverse events (57–59). Low-quality evidenceshowed no clear differences in adverse effects for ga-bapentin versus placebo (67, 68). Low-quality evidenceshowed that benzodiazepines caused more frequentsomnolence, fatigue, and lightheadedness than pla-cebo (20). Harms were not well-reported, and no RCTsassessed long-term use of benzodiazepines or risks foraddiction, abuse, or overdose. Adverse events for sys-temic corticosteroids were not well-reported in RCTs,but the largest trial found that oral prednisone was as-sociated with increased risk for any adverse event,insomnia, nervousness, and increased appetite (66).However, low-quality evidence showed no cases of hy-perglycemia that required medical attention (24, 61,64).
COMPARATIVE BENEFITS OF
NONPHARMACOLOGIC THERAPIES
Acute or Subacute Low Back Pain
Exercise
Low-quality evidence showed no difference be-
tween exercise therapy and usual care for pain or func-tion in patients with acute or subacute pain (11); addi-tional trials reported inconsistent results (73–75).Moderate-quality evidence showed no clear differ-ences between different exercise regimens in morethan 20 head-to-head RCTs in patients with acute lowback pain.
Acupuncture
Low-quality evidence showed that acupuncture re-
sulted in a small decrease in pain intensity comparedwith sham acupuncture with nonpenetrating needles,but there were no clear effects on function (76–78).Low-quality evidence showed that acupuncture slightlyincreased the likelihood of overall improvement com-pared with NSAIDs (76, 79–83).
Massage
Low-quality evidence showed that massage mod-
erately improved short-term (1 week) pain and functioncompared with sham therapy for subacute low backpain (84), although 1 trial (85) showed no difference inpain or function at 5 weeks. Moderate-quality evidenceshowed that massage improved short-term pain reliefNoninvasive Treatments for Acute, Subacute, and Chronic Low Back Pain CLINICAL GUIDELINE

nipulation, exercise therapy, relaxation therapy, acu-puncture, or physiotherapy) for patients with subacuteto chronic low back pain, but effects were small (84,86). Low-quality evidence showed that a combinationof massage plus another intervention (exercise, exer-cise and education, or usual care) was superior to theother intervention alone for short-term pain in patientswith subacute to chronic low back pain (84).
Spinal Manipulation
Low-quality evidence showed that spinal manipula-
tion was associated with a small effect on functioncomparedwithshammanipulation;evidencewasinsuf-ﬁcient to determine the effect on pain (87, 88). Low-quality evidence showed no difference in pain relief at1 week between spinal manipulation and inert treat-ment (educational booklet, detuned ultrasound, de-tuned or actual short-wave diathermy, antiedema gel,orbedrest),although1trialshowedbetterlonger-termpain relief (3 months) with spinal manipulation (89).Function did not differ between spinal manipulation
and inert treatment at 1 week or 3 months (89).Moderate-quality evidence showed no difference be-tween spinal manipulation and other active interven-tionsforpainreliefat1weekthrough1yearorfunction(analyses included exercise, physical therapy, or backschool as the comparator) (89, 90). Low-quality evi-dence showed that a combination of spinal manipula-tion plus exercise or advice slightly improved functionat 1 week compared with exercise or advice alone, butthese differences were not present at 1 or 3 months(89).
Superﬁcial Heat
Moderate-quality evidence showed that a heat
wrap moderately improved pain relief (at 5 days) anddisability (at 4 days) compared with placebo (91). Low-quality evidence showed that a combination of heatplus exercise provided greater pain relief and im-proved RDQ scores at 7 days compared with exercisealone in patients with acute pain (92). Low-quality evi-dence showed that a heat wrap provided more effec-tive pain relief and improved RDQ scores comparedwith acetaminophen or ibuprofen after 1 to 2 days (93).Low-quality evidence showed no clear differences be-tween a heat wrap and exercise in pain relief or func-tion (92).
Low-Level Laser Therapy
Low-quality evidence showed that a combination
of low-level laser therapy (LLLT) and NSAIDs largely de-creased pain intensity and resulted in a moderate im-provement in function (as measured by the ODI) com-pared with sham laser therapy plus NSAIDs in patientswith acute or subacute pain (94).Lumbar Supports
Low-quality evidence showed no difference in pain
or function between lumbar supports added to an ed-ucational program compared with an educational pro-gramaloneorotheractiveinterventionsinpatientswithacute or subacute low back pain (95).
Other Therapies
Evidence was insufﬁcient to determine the effec-
tiveness of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation(TENS), electrical muscle stimulation, inferential ther-apy, short-wave diathermy, traction, superﬁcial cold,motor control exercise (MCE), Pilates, tai chi, yoga, psy-chological therapies, multidisciplinary rehabilitation, ul-trasound, and taping.
Chronic Low Back Pain
Exercise
Moderate-quality evidence showed that exercise
resulted in a small improvement in pain relief and func-tion compared with no exercise (11, 96). Moderate-quality evidence showed that compared with usualcare, exercise resulted in small improvements in painintensity and function at the end of treatment, althougheffects were smaller at long-term follow-up (96).Moderate-quality evidence showed no clear differ-ences between different exercise regimens in morethan 20 head-to-head RCTs in patients with chronic lowback pain.
MCE
Motor control exercise focuses on restoring coordi-
nation,control,andstrengthofthemusclesthatcontroland support the spine. Low-quality evidence showedthat MCE moderately decreased pain scores andslightly improved function in short- to long-termfollow-up compared with a minimal intervention (97).Low-quality evidence showed that MCE resulted insmall improvements in pain intensity at short-term (≥6weeks to &lt;4 months) and intermediate-term (≥4 to &lt;8months) follow-up compared with general exercise, al-though improvements were small and no longer signif-icant at long-term follow-up (97). Motor control exer-cise also resulted in small improvements in function inthe short and long term (97). Low-quality evidenceshowed that MCE resulted in a moderate improvementin pain intensity and function compared with multi-modal physical therapy at intermediate follow-up (97).Low-quality evidence showed no clear differences inpain with a combination of MCE plus exercise versusexercise alone (98, 99).
Pilates
Low-quality evidence showed that Pilates resulted
in small or no clear effects on pain and no clear effectson function compared with usual care plus physical ac-tivity (100–107). Low-quality evidence showed no cleardifferences between Pilates and other types of exercisefor pain or function (108–110).CLINICAL GUIDELINE Noninvasive Treatments for Acute, Subacute, and Chronic Low Back Pain

Low-quality evidence showed that tai chi resulted
in moderate pain improvement compared with wait-listcontrols or no tai chi (111, 112), and 1 study showed asmall increase in function (111). Moderate-quality evi-dence showed that tai chi moderately decreased painintensity at 3 and 6 months compared with backwardwalking or jogging but not versus swimming (112).
Yoga
Low-quality evidence showed that Iyengar yoga re-
sulted in moderately lower pain scores and improvedfunction compared with usual care at 24 weeks (113).Low-quality evidence showed that yoga resulted in asmalldecreaseinpainintensitycomparedwithexercise(114–118). Low-quality evidence showed that, com-pared with education, yoga resulted in a small de-crease in short-term (≤12 weeks) but not long-term(about 1 year) pain intensity and a small increase inshort- and long-term function (119).
Psychological Therapies
Low-quality evidence showed that progressive re-
laxation therapy moderately improved pain intensityand functional status compared with wait-list controls(120). Low-quality evidence showed that electromyog-raphy biofeedback training moderately decreased painintensity (reduction of 5 to 13 points on a 100-pointpain scale) compared with wait-list controls, but therewas no effect on function (120). Low-quality evidenceshowed that operant therapy (behavioral therapy in-volving reinforcement) slightly improved pain intensitycompared with wait-list control, although there was nodifference for function (120). Low-quality evidenceshowed that cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) andother combined psychological therapies (involving ed-ucation, problem-solving training, coping techniques,imagery,relaxation,goalsetting,cognitivepaincontrol,and exercises) were associated with moderately im-proved pain intensity compared with wait-list controls,but there was no difference in function (120).Moderate-quality evidence showed that mindfulness-based stress reduction is an effective treatment forchronic low back pain. One study showed a small im-provement in pain at 26 and 52 weeks and in functionat 26 weeks compared with usual care (121). The samestudy showed no difference between mindfulness-based stress reduction and CBT for improvements inpain or function. Two other studies showed improve-ment in pain and function compared with education(122, 123). Low-quality evidence showed no differencebetween psychological therapies and exercise or phys-ical therapy for pain intensity (120). Low-quality evi-dence showed no differences in pain or function be-tween a combination of psychological therapy plusexercise or physiotherapy compared with exercise orphysiotherapy alone (120). Moderate-quality evidenceshowednodifferencesbetweendifferentpsychologicaltherapies for pain or function outcomes (120).Multidisciplinary Rehabilitation
Moderate-quality evidence showed that multidisci-
plinary rehabilitation moderately reduced short-term(&lt;3 months) and slightly reduced long-term pain inten-sity and disability compared with usual care, althoughthere was no difference in return to work (124). Low-quality evidence showed that multidisciplinary rehabil-itation was associated with moderately lower short-term pain intensity and slightly lower disability than norehabilitation(124).Moderate-qualityevidenceshowedthat multidisciplinary rehabilitation was associated withslightly lower short-term pain intensity and disability,moderately lower long-term pain intensity, and im-proved function compared with physical therapy and agreater likelihood of returning to work compared withnonmultidisciplinary rehabilitation (124).
Acupuncture
Low-quality evidence showed that acupuncture
was associated with moderate improvement in pain re-lief immediately after treatment and up to 12 weekslater compared with sham acupuncture, but there wasno improvement in function (125–130). Moderate-quality evidence showed that acupuncture was associ-ated with moderately lower pain intensity and im-proved function compared with no acupuncture at theend of treatment (125). Low-quality evidence showed asmall improvement in pain relief and function com-pared with medications (NSAIDs, muscle relaxants, oranalgesics) (125).
Massage
Low-quality evidence showed no difference in pain
between foot reﬂexology and usual care for patientswith chronic low back pain (131–133). Moderate-qualityevidence showed that massage improved short-termpain relief and function compared with other interven-tions (manipulation, exercise therapy, relaxation ther-apy, acupuncture, physiotherapy, or TENS) for patientswith subacute to chronic low back pain, although ef-fects were small (84, 86). Low-quality evidence showedthat a combination of massage plus another interven-tion (exercise, exercise and education, or usual care)was superior to the other intervention alone for short-term pain in patients with subacute to chronic low backpain (84).
Spinal Manipulation
Low-quality evidence showed no difference in pain
with spinal manipulation versus sham manipulation at 1month (134, 135). Low-quality evidence showed thatspinal manipulation slightly improved pain comparedwith an inert treatment (136–142). Moderate-quality ev-idence showed no clear differences in pain or functioncompared with another active intervention.

143–147).
Ultrasound
Low-quality evidence showed no difference be-
tween ultrasound and sham ultrasound for pain at theend of treatment or 4 weeks after treatment (148–150).Low-quality evidence showed no difference betweenultrasound and no ultrasound for pain or function (151,152).
TENS
Low-quality evidence showed no difference be-
tween TENS and sham TENS for pain intensity or func-tion at short-term follow-up (153). Low-quality evidenceshowed no difference between TENS and acupuncturein short- or long-term pain (154).
LLLT
Low-quality evidence showed that LLLT slightly im-
proved pain compared with sham laser (155–157), and1 RCT (155) showed that LLLT slightly improved func-tion compared with sham laser.
Lumbar Support
Evidence was insufﬁcient to compare lumbar sup-
port versus no lumbar support. Low-quality evidenceshowed no difference between a lumbar support plusexercise (muscle strengthening) versus exercise alonefor pain or function at 8 weeks or 6 months (158). Low-quality evidence showed no clear differences betweenlumbar supports and other active treatments (traction,spinal manipulation, exercise, physiotherapy, or TENS)for pain or function (159–161).
Taping

tween Kinesio taping and sham taping for back-speciﬁcfunction after 5 or 12 weeks, although effects on painwere inconsistent between the 2 trials (162, 163). Low-quality evidence showed no differences between Kine-sio taping and exercise for pain or function (164, 165).
Other Therapies
Evidence was insufﬁcient to determine the effec-
tiveness of electrical muscle stimulation, interferentialtherapy, short-wave diathermy, traction, or superﬁcialheat or cold.
Radicular Low Back Pain
Exercise
Low-quality evidence showed that exercise re-
sulted in small improvements in pain and function com-pared with usual care or no exercise (166–168).
Traction
Low-quality evidence showed no clear differences
between traction and other active treatments, betweentraction plus physiotherapy versus physiotherapy
alone, or between different types of traction in patientswith low back pain with or without radiculopathy (169).
Other Therapies
Evidence was insufﬁcient for ultrasound, MCE,
Pilates, tai chi, yoga, psychological therapies, multidis-ciplinary rehabilitation, acupuncture, massage, spinalmanipulation, LLLT, electrical muscle stimulation, short-wave diathermy, TENS, interferential therapy, superﬁ-cial heat or cold, lumbar support, and taping.
HARMS OF NONPHARMACOLOGIC THERAPIES
Evidence on adverse events from the included
RCTs and systematic reviews was limited, and the qual-ityofevidenceforallavailableharmsdataislow.Harmswere poorly reported (if they were reported at all) formost of the interventions.
Low-quality evidence showed no reported harms
or serious adverse events associated with tai chi, psy-chological interventions, multidisciplinary rehabilita-tion, ultrasound, acupuncture, lumbar support, or trac-tion (9, 95, 150, 170–174). Low-quality evidenceshowed that when harms were reported for exercise,they were often related to muscle soreness and in-creased pain, and no serious harms were reported. Allreported harms associated with yoga were mild tomoderate (119). Low-quality evidence showed thatnone of the RCTs reported any serious adverse eventswith massage, although 2 RCTs reported soreness dur-ing or after massage therapy (175, 176). Adverseevents associated with spinal manipulation includedmuscle soreness or transient increases in pain (134).There were few adverse events reported and no cleardifferences between MCE and controls. Transcutane-ous electrical nerve stimulation was associated with anincreased risk for skin site reaction but not serious ad-verse events (177). Two RCTs (178, 179) showed anincreased risk for skin ﬂushing with heat compared withno heat or placebo, and no serious adverse eventswere reported. There were no data on cold therapy.Evidence was insufﬁcient to determine harms of electri-cal muscle stimulation, LLLT, percutaneous electricalnerve stimulation, interferential therapy, short-wavediathermy, and taping.
COMPARISON OF CONCLUSIONS WITHTHOSE
OF THE 2007 G UIDELINE
Some evidence has changed since the 2007 ACP
guideline and supporting evidence review. The 2007review concluded that acetaminophen was effective foracute low back pain, based on indirect evidence fromtrials of acetaminophen for other conditions and trialsof acetaminophen versus other analgesics. However,this update included a placebo-controlled RCT in pa-tients with low back pain that showed no difference ineffectiveness between acetaminophen and placebo(low-quality evidence). In addition, contrary to the 2007CLINICAL GUIDELINE Noninvasive Treatments for Acute, Subacute, and Chronic Low Back Pain

Downloaded from https://annals.org by Yi-Fei Zhao on 06/24/2024. review, current moderate-quality evidence showed that
TCAs were not effective for chronic low back pain com-pared with placebo. Additional pharmacologic treat-ments addressed in the current review included dulox-etine and the antiseizure medication pregabalin. Manyconclusions about nonpharmacologic interventions aresimilar between the 2007 review and the update. Addi-tional modalities assessed (with at least low-quality ev-idence) include mindfulness-based stress reduction,MCE, taping, and tai chi. Additional evidence orchanges from the updated review include that superﬁ-cial heat was found to be more effective for acute orsubacute low back pain (moderate-quality evidence)and neither ultrasound nor TENS was shown to be ef-fective compared with controls (low-quality evidence).
TheFiguresummarizes the recommendations and
clinical considerations. Additional details on the evi-dence are available in Appendix Tables 1 to4and the
accompanying evidence reviews (7, 8).
RECOMMENDATIONS
Recommendation 1: Given that most patients with
acute or subacute low back pain improve over time re-gardless of treatment, clinicians and patients should se-lect nonpharmacologic treatment with superﬁcial heat(moderate-quality evidence), massage, acupuncture, orspinal manipulation (low-quality evidence). If pharmaco-logic treatment is desired, clinicians and patients shouldselect nonsteroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs or skeletalmuscle relaxants (moderate-quality evidence). (Grade:strong recommendation)
Clinicians should inform all patients of the gener-
ally favorable prognosis of acute low back pain with orwithoutsciatica,includingahighlikelihoodforsubstan-tial improvement in the ﬁrst month (5, 180). Cliniciansshouldalsoprovidepatientswithevidence-basedinfor-mation with regard to their expected course, advisethem to remain active as tolerated, and provide infor-mation about effective self-care options. Clinicians andpatients should use a shared decision-making ap-proach to select the most appropriate treatment basedon patient preferences, availability, harms, and costs ofthe interventions. Nonpharmacologic interventionsshown to be effective for improving pain and functionin patients with acute or subacute low back pain in-clude superﬁcial heat (moderate-quality evidence andmoderate improvement in pain and function) and mas-sage (low-quality evidence and small to moderate im-provement in pain and function). Low-quality evidenceshowed that acupuncture had a small effect on improv-ing pain and spinal manipulation had a small effect onimproving function compared with sham manipulationbut not inert treatment. Harms of nonpharmacologicinterventions were sparsely reported, and no seriousadverse events were reported. Superﬁcial heat was as-sociated with increased risk for skin ﬂushing, and mas-sage and spinal manipulation were associated withmuscle soreness.
We recommend that the choice between NSAIDs
andSMRsbeindividualizedonthebasisofpatientpref-erences and likely individual medication risk proﬁle.
Treatment with NSAIDs resulted in a small improve-mentinbothpainintensity(moderate-qualityevidence)and function (low-quality evidence), and treatment withSMRs resulted in a small improvement in pain relief(moderate-quality evidence). There was no evidencefor the effect of SMRs on function. Nonsteroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs are associated with gastrointestinaland renal risks. Clinicians should therefore assess reno-vascular and gastrointestinal risk factors before pre-scribing NSAIDs and recommend the lowest effectivedosesfortheshortestperiodsnecessary.Althoughtheyare associated with lower risk for adverse effects thannonselective NSAIDs, COX-2–selective NSAIDs werenot assessed for improvement in pain or function. Skel-etal muscle relaxants are associated with central ner-vous system adverse effects, especially sedation.
The updated evidence showed that acetamino-
phenwasnoteffectiveatimprovingpainoutcomesver-sus placebo. However, this study assessed pain at 3weeks after the intervention, and evidence from head-to-head trials showed no difference between acetamin-ophen and NSAIDs. Low-quality evidence showed thatsystemic steroids were not effective in treating acute orsubacute low back pain, and we recommend againstthese drugs for treatment of acute low back pain.
Recommendation 2: For patients with chronic low
back pain, clinicians and patients should initially selectnonpharmacologic treatment with exercise, multidisci-plinary rehabilitation, acupuncture, mindfulness-basedstress reduction (moderate-quality evidence), tai chi,yoga, motor control exercise, progressive relaxation,electromyography biofeedback, low-level laser therapy,operant therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, or spinalmanipulation (low-quality evidence). (Grade: strongrecommendation)
Nonpharmacologicinterventionsareconsideredas
ﬁrst-line options in patients with chronic low back painbecausefewerharmsareassociatedwiththesetypesoftherapies than with pharmacologic options. It is impor-tant that physical therapies be administered by provid-ers with appropriate training. Moderate-quality evi-dence showed that exercise therapy resulted in smallimprovements in pain and function. Speciﬁc compo-nents associated with greater effects on pain includedindividually designed programs, supervised home ex-ercise, and group exercise; regimens that includedstretching and strength training were most effective.Moderate-quality evidence showed that, comparedwith usual care, multidisciplinary rehabilitation resultedin moderate pain improvement in the short term (&lt;3months), small pain improvement in the long term, andsmall improvement in function in both the short and
long term. Low-quality evidence showed that multidis-ciplinary rehabilitation resulted in a moderate improve-ment in pain and a small improvement in functioncompared with no multidisciplinary rehabilitation. Acu-puncture had a moderate effect on pain and functioncompared with no acupuncture (moderate-quality evi-

effect on function compared with sham acupuncture(low-quality evidence). Moderate-quality evidenceshowed that mindfulness-based stress reduction re-sulted in small improvements in pain and function(smalleffect),and1studyshowedthatitwasequivalentto CBT for improving back pain and function.
Low-quality evidence showed that tai chi had a
moderate effect on pain and a small effect on function.Tai chi sessions in included studies lasted 40 to 45 min-utes and were done 2 to 5 times per week for 10 to 24weeks. Low-quality evidence showed that yoga im-proved pain and function by a moderate amount com-paredwithusualcareandbyasmallamountcomparedwith education. Low-quality evidence showed that MCEhad a moderate effect on pain and a small effect onfunction. Motor control exercise, tai chi, and yoga werefavored over general exercise (low-quality evidence).
Low-quality evidence showed that progressive re-
laxation had a moderate effect on pain and function,electromyography biofeedback and CBT each had amoderate effect on pain and no effect on function, andoperant therapy had a small effect on pain and no ef-fect on function. Low-quality evidence showed thatLLLT had a small effect on pain and function.

Therewere no clear differences between spinal manipulation
and other active interventions (moderate-qualityevidence).
Harmswerepoorlyreportedfornonpharmacologic
therapies, although no serious harms were reported forany of the recommended interventions. Muscle sore-ness was reported for exercise, massage, and spinalmanipulation.
Ultrasound, TENS, and Kinesio taping had no effect
on pain or function compared with control treatments(low-quality evidence).
Recommendation 3: In patients with chronic low
back pain who have had an inadequate response tononpharmacologic therapy, clinicians and patientsshould consider pharmacologic treatment with non-steroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs as ﬁrst-line therapy, ortramadol or duloxetine as second-line therapy. Clini-cians should only consider opioids as an option in pa-tients who have failed the aforementioned treatmentsand only if the potential beneﬁts outweigh the risks forindividual patients and after a discussion of known risksand realistic beneﬁts with patients.

Recommendations Recommendation 1: Given that most patients with acute or subacute low back pain improve over time regardless of treatment, 
clinicians and patients should select nonpharmacologic treatment with superﬁcial heat (moderate-quality evidence), massage,
acupuncture, or spinal manipulation (low-quality evidence). If pharmacologic treatment is desired, clinicians and patients 
should select nonsteroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs or skeletal muscle relaxants (moderate-quality evidence). (Grade: strong 
recommendation)
Recommendation 2: For patients with chronic low back pain, clinicians and patients should initially select nonpharmacologic 
treatment with exercise, multidisciplinary rehabilitation, acupuncture, mindfulness-based stress reduction (moderate-quality 
evidence), tai chi, yoga, motor control exercise, progressive relaxation, electromyography biofeedback, low-level laser therapy , 
operant therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, or spinal manipulation (low-quality evidence). (Grade: strong recommendation)
Recommendation 3: In patients with chronic low back pain who have had an inadequate response to nonpharmacologic 
therapy, clinicians and patients should consider pharmacologic treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs as 
ﬁrst-line therapy, or tramadol or duloxetine as second-line therapy. Clinicians should only consider opioids as an option in patients who have failed the aforementioned treatments and only if the potential beneﬁts outweigh the risks for individual patients and after a discussion of known risks and realistic beneﬁts with patients. (Grade: weak recommendation, 
moderate-quality evidence)
High-Value Care Clinicians should reassure patients that acute or subacute low back pain usually improves over time regardless o f treatment and 
should avoid prescribing costly and potentially harmful treatments. Systemic steroids were not shown to provide benefit and should not be prescribed for patients with acute or subacute low back pain, even with radicular symptoms. For treatment of chronic low back pain, clinicians should select therapies that have the fewest harms and lowest costs. Clinicians should avoid prescribing costly therapies and those with substantial potential harms, such as long-term opioids, and pharmacologic therapies  
that were not shown to be effective, such as tricyclic antidepressants and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.
Clinical Considerations Clinicians should inform patients with acute or subacute low back pain of the generally very favorable o utcome. Thus, patients can
avoid potentially harmful and costly tests and treatments.
Clinicians should advise patients with acute, subacute, or chronic low back pain to remain active as tolerated.Improvements in pain and function due to pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions were small and often showed no 
clear differences compared with controls.
Few differences in recommended therapies were found when they were studied in head-to-head trials. Therefore, clinicians should
base treatment recommendations on patient preferences that also minimize harms and costs.

shouldbetheﬁrstoptionconsidered.Moderate-qualityevidence showed no difference in pain improvementwhen different NSAIDs were compared with one an-other. Nonsteroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs are associ-ated with gastrointestinal and renal risks. Clinicians
should therefore assess renovascular and gastrointesti-nal risk factors before prescribing NSAIDs and shouldrecommend the lowest effective doses for the shortestperiods necessary. COX-2–selective NSAIDs were notassessed for improvement in pain or function, althoughthey are associated with lower risk for adverse effectsthan nonselective NSAIDs.
For second-line therapies, moderate-quality evi-
dence showed that tramadol had a moderate effect onpain and a small effect on function in the short term. Ofnote, tramadol is a narcotic and, like other opioids, isassociated with the risk for abuse (181). Moderate-quality evidence showed that duloxetine had a smalleffect on pain and function.
Moderate-quality evidence showed that opioids
(morphine, oxymorphone, hydromorphone, and tapen-tadol) had a small effect on short-term pain and func-tion. Low-quality evidence showed that buprenorphine(patchorsublingual)resultedinasmallimprovementinpain. Opioids should be the last treatment option con-sidered and should be considered only in patients forwhom other therapies have failed because they are as-sociated with substantial harms. Moderate-quality evi-dence showed no difference in pain or function whendifferent long-acting opioids were compared with oneanother. Harms of short-term use of opioids include in-creased nausea, dizziness, constipation, vomiting, som-nolence, and dry mouth compared with placebo. Stud-ies assessing opioids for the treatment of chronic lowback pain did not address the risk for addiction, abuse,or overdose, although observational studies haveshown a dose-dependent relationship between opioiduse for chronic pain and serious harms (182).
Moderate-quality evidence showed that TCAs did
not effectively improve pain or function (low-quality ev-idence) in patients with chronic low back pain, which iscontrary to the 2007 guideline. In addition, moderate-quality evidence showed that SSRIs did not improvepain.
AREAS OF INCONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE
Evidence is insufﬁcient or lacking to determine
treatments for radicular low back pain. Most RCTs en-rolled a mixture of patients with acute, subacute, andchroniclowbackpain,soitisdifﬁculttoextrapolatethebeneﬁts of treatment compared with its duration. Useof opioids for chronic pain is an important area thatrequires further research to compare beneﬁts andharms of therapy. The evidence is also insufﬁcient formost physical modalities. Evidence is insufﬁcient onwhich patients are likely to beneﬁt from which speciﬁctherapy.Evidenceonpatient-importantoutcomes,suchas disability or return to work, was largely unavailable,and available evidence showed no clear connection
with improvements in pain.
HIGH-VALUECARE
Clinicians should reassure patients that acute or
subacute low back pain usually improves over time, re-gardlessoftreatment.Thus,cliniciansshouldavoidpre-scribing costly and potentially harmful treatments forthese patients, especially narcotics. In addition, sys-temic steroids were not shown to provide beneﬁt andshouldnotbeprescribedforpatientswithacuteorsub-acute low back pain, even with radicular symptoms. Fortreatment of chronic low back pain, clinicians shouldselect therapies that have the fewest harms and lowestcosts because there were no clear comparative advan-tages for most treatments compared with one another.Clinicians should avoid prescribing costly therapies;those with substantial potential harms, such as long-term opioids (which can be associated with addictionand accidental overdose); and pharmacologic thera-pies that were not shown to be effective, such as TCAsand SSRIs.

APPENDIX :DETAILED METHODS
The evidence review was conducted by the
AHRQ's Paciﬁc Northwest Evidence-based PracticeCenter. Details of the ACP guideline development pro-cess can befoundin ACP's methods paper (12). Disclo-sures of interests and management of any conﬂicts canbe found at www.acponline.org/clinical_information/guidelines/guidelines/conﬂicts_cgc.htm.
Key Questions Addressed
1. What are the comparative beneﬁts and harms of
different pharmacologic therapies for acute or chronicnonradicular low back pain, radicular low back pain, orspinal stenosis, including NSAIDs, acetaminophen, opi-oids, muscle relaxants, antiseizure medications, antide-pressants, corticosteroids, and topical or patch-delivered medications?
2. What are the comparative beneﬁts and harms of
different nonpharmacologic, noninvasive therapies foracute or chronic nonradicular low back pain, radicularlow back pain, or spinal stenosis, including but not lim-ited to interdisciplinary rehabilitation, exercise (varioustypes), physical modalities (ultrasound, TENS, electricalmuscle stimulation, interferential therapy, heat [variousforms], and ice), traction tables/devices, back supports/bracing, spinal manipulation, various psychologicaltherapies, acupuncture, massage therapy (varioustypes), yoga, magnets, and low-level lasers?Search Strategy
Reviewers searched MEDLINE, the Cochrane Cen-
tral Register of Controlled Trials, and the Cochrane Da-tabase of Systematic Reviews for trials published fromJanuary 2008 through April 2015. Searches were up-dated through November 2016. Studies published be-fore 2008 were identiﬁed using the 2007 ACP/APS sys-tematic reviews (10, 11).
Quality Assessment
Randomized trials were evaluated using methods
developed by the Cochrane Back Review Group andthe AHRQ (183), and systematic reviews were assessedusing AMSTAR (A Measurement Tool to Assess System-atic Reviews) (184).
Population Studied
Adults with acute, subacute, or chronic nonradicu-
lar low back pain, radicular low back pain, or symptom-atic spinal stenosis.
Interventions Evaluated
Oral or topical pharmacologic therapies included
NSAIDs, acetaminophen, opioids, tramadol and tapen-tadol, antidepressants, SMRs, benzodiazepines, corti-costeroids, antiepileptic medications, capsaicin, andlidocaine.
Noninvasive, nonpharmacologic therapies in-
cluded interdisciplinary or multicomponent rehabilita-tion (physical therapy plus psychological therapy withsome coordination), psychological therapies, exerciseand related interventions (such as yoga or tai chi), com-plementary and alternative medicine therapies (spinalmanipulation, acupuncture, and massage), passivephysical modalities (such as heat, cold, ultrasound,TENS, electrical muscle stimulation, interferential ther-apy, short-wave diathermy, traction, LLLT, and lumbarsupports/braces), and taping.
Comparators
Interventions were compared with each other or
with placebo (drug trials), sham (functionally inert)treatments, or no treatment.
Outcomes
Outcomes included reduction or elimination of low
back pain (including related leg symptoms), improve-ment in back-speciﬁc and overall function, improve-ment in health-related quality of life, reduction in workdisability and return to work, global improvement,number of back pain episodes or time between epi-sodes, patient satisfaction, and adverse effects ofinterventions.
Timing
Timing of outcomes was stratiﬁed as long-term (≥1
year) and short-term (≤6 months).
Setting
Settings included inpatient and outpatient.
Annals.org Annals of Internal Medicine •Vol. 166 No. 7 •4 April 2017
Downloaded from https://annals.org by Yi-Fei Zhao on 06/24/2024. Target Audience
The target audience includes all clinicians.
Target Patient Population
The target patient population includes adults with
acute (&lt;4 weeks), subacute (4 to 12 weeks), or chronic(&gt;12 weeks) nonradicular low back pain, radicular lowback pain, or symptomatic spinal stenosis. Children oradolescents with low back pain; pregnant women; andpatients with low back pain from sources outside theback (nonspinal low back pain), ﬁbromyalgia or othermyofascial pain syndromes, and thoracic or cervicalback pain are not included.
Peer Review
The AHRQ systematic review was sent to invited
peer reviewers and posted on the AHRQ Web site forpublic comments. The accompanying evidence reviews
(7, 8) also underwent a peer review process throughthe journal. The guideline underwent a peer reviewprocess through the journal and was posted online forcomments from ACP Regents and ACP Governors, whorepresent ACP members at the regional level.
