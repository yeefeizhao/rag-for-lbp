Healthy Ageing (2021–2030). 
Most people who experience an episode of 
acute LBP experience time-limited, low-to-
moderate levels of disability and a favourable 
clinical course. Often, the experience of LBP 
is recurrent, and acute episodes become 
more frequent in older age. In some people, 
concurrent spine-related leg pain may also 
be experienced. There is a group of people 
who experience persisting symptoms beyond 
three months, which is defined as chronic 
LBP . Chronic LBP is often associated with 
a reduced ability to participate in family, 
social and work roles, and incurs major 
costs to families, communities and health 
systems. People who experience chronic LBP , 
particularly older people, are more likely 
to experience poverty, prematurely exit the 
workforce and accumulate less retirement 
wealth. In all settings, disabling LBP and 
early retirement owing to chronic symptoms 
are more common among people with lower 
socioeconomic status, thus contributing to 
poverty and inequity. Optimizing the clinical 
management of people with chronic LBP 
is therefore a current priority for Member 
States. 
Among older people, an experience of LBP 
is common and often gives rise to loss of 
physical and mental capacities (i.e. intrinsic 
capacity). For many older people, LBP is 
particularly burdensome because it restricts 
mobility and thus the ability to participate 
in society, thereby leading to psychosocial 
impacts. It is also associated with significant Executive summary
Introduction
Low back pain (LBP) is a very common 
condition experienced by most people across 
their life course. In 2020, approximately 
one in 13 people globally experienced LBP , 
equating to an estimated 619 million people; 
this represents a 60% increase in cases since 
1990. Within this same period, absolute 
global disability estimates attributed to LBP 
have increased by about the same amount, 
being largely ascribed to population growth 
and ageing, with the largest increases 
observed in low- and middle-income 
countries. LBP is currently the leading cause 
of disability globally across all ages and in 
both sexes, while prevalence and disability 
estimates are consistently higher in females 
and older people. Among health conditions 
that may benefit from rehabilitation, LBP is 
the condition which represents the greatest 
number of people for whom benefits may 
be experienced. For these reasons, among 
others, LBP is an important global public 
health issue.
The prevalence, health burden and 
economic cost associated with LBP care and 
participation restriction continue to rise, 
care variation and critical knowledge and 
skills gaps among health workers persist, and 
delivery of care that is not evidence-based 
remains commonplace. No guideline has 
been produced that considers management 
of chronic LBP in adults, and in particular 
for older people, from a global public health 
perspective that takes into account universal 
health coverage (UHC) and the different levels 
of economic development across countries. 
The present guideline fills this gap, supports 
other activities undertaken by WHO in 
improving outcomes for adults with LBP and 
1
Executive summary comorbidities and higher mortality, and 
is strongly related to a decrease in health-
related quality of life, particularly when spine-
related leg pain is also present. Concurrent 
musculoskeletal pain, loss of mobility, frailty, 
falls, urinary incontinence and poor sleep 
are important adverse health outcomes 
associated with chronic LBP in older people.
Purpose, scope and target audience
The purpose of the guideline is to provide 
evidence-based recommendations on non-
surgical interventions for chronic primary 
LBP (CPLBP) in adults, including older 
people, that can be delivered in primary and 
community care settings to improve CPLBP-
related health and well-being outcomes. For 
this reason, the guideline does not consider 
interventions typically delivered in secondary 
or tertiary care settings (e.g. surgical or 
other invasive procedures) or workplace 
interventions. 
The target audience is health workers of 
all disciplines working in the primary and 
community care settings. In this context, the 
guideline is intended to be discipline neutral. 
The guidelines will be of use to clinical staff 
including medical doctors, nurses, allied 
health workers including chiropractors, 
occupational therapists, physiotherapists, 
pharmacists, psychologists and community 
health workers, as well as public health 
programme and system managers.
Chronic primary low back pain 
(CPLBP)
A persistent or recurrent pain 
experience of more than three 
months that is not reliably attributed 
to an underlying disease process or 
structural lesion. Five classes of interventions for the 
management of CPLBP in adults were 
considered for the guideline: A) standardized 
and structured education; B) physical 
interventions; C) psychological interventions; 
D) medicines; and E) multicomponent 
interventions. 
The guideline addresses the 
following overarching question:
“What are the health and well-being 
benefits and harms of non-surgical 
interventions in the management of 
chronic primary low back pain, with 
or without spine-related leg pain, 
in community-dwelling adults in 
primary or community care settings, 
including older people (60 years and 
older), compared with placebo, no 
intervention or usual care?” 
The guideline does not consider surgical 
interventions, invasive intraspinous 
interventions or workplace interventions 
for people with CPLBP , primary prevention 
interventions for LBP , management of acute 
LBP or interventions for chronic secondary 
LBP .
Guideline development methods
The guideline was developed in accordance 
with the process described in the WHO 
handbook for guideline development . The 
development process was coordinated by the 
Ageing and Health Unit, with methods advice 
provided by an independent guidelines 
methodologist and governance oversight 
provided by the internal WHO Steering Group 
and WHO Guideline Review Committee. The 
external Guideline Development Group (GDG) 
was responsible for refining the scope of 
the guideline and defining the population, 
2
WHO guideline for non-surgical management of chronic primary low back 
pain in adults in primary and community care settings priority interventions for systematic 
evidence reviews, comparators and critical 
outcomes. The Grading of Recommendations 
Assessment, Development and Evaluation 
(GRADE) approach was used to appraise 
the certainty of the quantitative evidence 
for benefits and harms of each prioritized 
intervention. An evidence synthesis of 
qualitative studies examining the values 
and preferences for, and acceptability and 
feasibility of, the interventions and their 
outcomes from the perspective of older 
people was commissioned to support the 
GDG in formulating recommendations. 
Confidence in qualitative evidence synthesis 
findings was appraised using the GRADE-
CERQual method. The GDG participated 
in three meetings to review and interpret 
evidence and formulate recommendations. 
The GDG formulated recommendations 
for each intervention based on the GRADE 
Evidence-to-Decision (EtD) approach for 
public health interventions. The independent 
methodologist guided the GDG in interpreting 
the evidence of benefits and harms, 
understanding GRADE certainty-of-evidence 
assessments and translating evidence 
into recommendations. This included 
assessment of the effects (balance of benefits 
and harms) of interventions on outcomes 
for people with CPLBP , and consideration 
of other EtD domains: the values and 
preferences of people with CPLBP and their 
families and health workers relating to the 
interventions and their outcomes, as well 
as the acceptability and feasibility of the 
interventions, resources required and equity. 
The GDG was responsible for determining the 
worthwhile benefit and risk of harm for an 
intervention based on effect-size estimates 
from the systematic reviews and other factors 
related to the delivery and accessibility of an 
intervention.In general, conditional recommendations 
were made when overall certainty was low 
or very low, and/or when the judgements 
in other domains indicated variability or 
uncertainty. Conditional recommendations 
in favour suggest the intervention is 
recommended in most situations, but will 
not be suitable for everyone and, therefore, 
shared decision-making and considering 
appropriateness in certain populations 
or settings will be required. Conditional 
recommendations against use suggest the 
intervention is not recommended in most 
circumstances, since the harms (or other 
negative consequences beyond adverse 
health outcomes) probably outweigh the 
benefits. A good practice statement reflects 
a body of indirect evidence that is difficult to 
summarize and indicates that the desirable 
consequences of the intervention far 
outweigh its undesirable consequences and, 
as such, the intervention is recommended. 
For each intervention, WHO provides a 
recommendation other than in circumstances 
where no evidence was available, where 
the evidence was too limited to make a 
judgement, or where the balance between 
benefits and harms was so equivocal 
that a judgement could not be made with 
confidence.
Recommendations
The guideline considers 37 interventions 
across five intervention classes. There are 
24 recommendations, one good practice 
statement and 12 interventions for which no 
recommendation was made (Table 1). Each 
recommendation is relevant to community-
dwelling adults experiencing CPLBP , with 
or without spine-related leg pain. While 
the population definition allowed for the 
inclusion of comorbid spine-related leg 
pain, the GDG was not able to confidently 
interpret the effects of interventions in 
3
Executive summary subpopulations with and without spine-
related leg pain, since classification systems 
varied across trials and some trials did not 
report on spine-related leg pain prevalence. 
Where the included trials report outcomes 
separately for older people or included older 
people (adults aged 60 years and over) in 
their mean age range, or where evidence 
(direct or indirect) of harms is also relevant 
to older people, the recommendations 
also refer to older people. The GDG 
provided supporting commentaries for its 
recommendations. These remarks or key 
considerations are intended to contextualize 
the recommendations and provide 
additional guidance for implementation 
into practice. The GDG foregrounded its 
recommendations around four guiding 
principles: i) holistic and person-centred care; 
ii) equity; iii) care that is non-stigmatizing 
and non-discriminatory; and iv) integrated 
and coordinated care. Clinical practice 
considerations have also been formulated 
to support interpretation and translation of 
the recommendations into practice, service 
delivery and policy. These broadly include: 
i) arranging clinical assessment and timely 
referral, where indicated; ii) providing 
personalized information and advice; iii) 
delivering interventions that address the 
range of factors contributing to a person’s 
CPLBP experience; and iv) selecting and 
sequencing interventions according to the 
needs and preferences of the person with CPLBP . For medicines, the GDG foregrounded 
its recommendations with supporting 
commentaries around safe medication 
practices applicable to all medicines, with 
additional attention to opioid analgesics.
Twelve “no recommendations” were made. 
The balance between benefits and harms 
for three psychological interventions and 
non-pharmacological weight loss were 
so equivocal that a recommendation 
could not be made. The GDG judged that 
there was insufficient evidence to make a 
recommendation for five herbal medicines, 
while no evidence was available concerning 
the therapeutic use of three medicines 
to allow recommendations for these 
products to be formulated: paracetamol 
(acetaminophen), benzodiazepines 
and cannabis-related pharmaceutical 
preparations. Nonetheless, the GDG 
considered it important to provide guidance 
on the use of these three products in 
particular, given their use in clinical practice 
(see Box 1).

WHO guideline for non-surgical management of chronic primary low back 
pain in adults in primary and community care settings Box 1:  
Key considerations for paracetamol (acetaminophen), benzodiazepines 
and cannabis-related pharmaceutical preparations for therapeutic use.
Paracetamol (acetaminophen) is associated with potential cardiovascular, 
renal and gastrointestinal harms and increased mortality risk, particularly 
in older people with hepatic or renal impairment. Although paracetamol is 
commonly used as a first-line analgesic medicine, available evidence for its 
use in acute LBP suggests it is not superior to placebo in reducing pain, and 
there is no biological reason why a different effect would be observed in 
CPLBP . 
Benzodiazepines are associated with potential harms including memory 
impairment, misuse, overdose deaths from respiratory depression, 
somnolence, fatigue and light-headedness potentially leading to falls. Other 
complications of long-term use of benzodiazepines include development 
of tolerance, dependence and withdrawal syndrome particularly after 
abrupt cessation, which can be life-threatening. The unknown efficacy of 
benzodiazepines in CPLBP and risk of harms suggests benzodiazepines 
would not be an appropriate first-line medicine choice for CPLBP . 
Cannabis-related pharmaceutical preparations for therapeutic use 
are not likely to be an appropriate first-line medicine for the management 
of CPLBP due to a lack of direct evidence of benefit in this condition and 
evidence of possible adverse events, including harms associated with its non-
medicinal use.
The recommended interventions are 
intended to be implemented by countries 
as a suite of likely effective intervention 
options to support adults with CPLBP . Given 
the multifactorial and complex aetiology 
of CPLBP , a single intervention in isolation 
may be inadequate to confer benefit, 
thereby rationalizing the need to provide a 
suite of effective intervention options from which health workers can select, tailor and 
sequence according to the unique needs, 
preferences and circumstances of individuals, 
guided by a biopsychosocial perspective and 
the context of the local health system. For 
those interventions with conditional against 
recommendation, discontinuation of routine 
delivery is recommended in most situations.Interpreting recommendations and their 
implementation
