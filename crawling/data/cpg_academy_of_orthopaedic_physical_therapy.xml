tions, including specific trunk muscle activation, for pa -
tients with acute low back pain (LBP).
EXERCISE FOR ACUTE LOW BACK PAIN WITH LEG PAIN
BPhysical therapists may use exercise training interven -
tions, including trunk muscle strengthening and endur -
ance and specific trunk muscle activation, to reduce pain and 
disability for patients with acute LBP with leg pain.
EXERCISE FOR CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN
APhysical therapists should use exercise training interven -
tions, including trunk muscle strengthening and endur -
ance, multimodal exercise interventions, specific trunk muscle 
activation exercise, aerobic exercise, aquatic exercise, and gener -
al exercise, for patients with chronic LBP .
BPhysical therapists may provide movement control exercise 
or trunk mobility exercise for patients with chronic LBP .

BPhysical therapists may use exercise training interven -
tions, including specific trunk muscle activation and 
movement control, for patients with chronic LBP with leg pain.
EXERCISE FOR CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN WITH 
MOVEMENT CONTROL IMPAIRMENT
APhysical therapists should use specific trunk muscle acti -
vation and movement control exercise for patients with 
chronic LBP and movement control impairment.
EXERCISE FOR CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN IN OLDER ADUL TS
APhysical therapists should use general exercise training to 
reduce pain and disability in older adults with chronic LBP .
EXERCISE FOR POSTOPERATIVE LOW BACK PAIN

patients with LBP following lumbar spine surgery.
MANUAL AND OTHER DIRECTED THERAPIES 
FOR ACUTE LOW BACK PAIN
APhysical therapists should use thrust or nonthrust joint 
mobilization to reduce pain and disability in patients with 
acute LBP .BPhysical therapists may use massage or soft tissue  
mobilization for short-term pain relief in patients with 
acute LBP .
MANUAL AND OTHER DIRECTED THERAPIES 
FOR CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN
APhysical therapists should use thrust or nonthrust joint 
mobilization to reduce pain and disability in patients with

Acute and Chronic Low Back Pain: Clinical Practice GuidelinesAcute and Chronic Low Back Pain: Clinical Practice GuidelinesEDUCATION FOR ACUTE LOW BACK PAIN
BPhysical therapists may use active education strategies 
rather than passive strategies (ie, providing access to ed -
ucational materials only). Active education strategies include 
one-on-one education on the biopsychosocial contributors to 
pain and self-management techniques, such as remaining active, 
pacing strategies, and back-protection techniques. Physical ther -
apists may also incorporate counseling on the favorable natural 
history of acute LBP as part of the education strategy.
EDUCATION FOR CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN
BPhysical therapists may use standard education strate -
gies for patients with chronic LBP , but not as a stand-
alone treatment. Standard education strategies include advice 
related to exercise and advice about staying active.APhysical therapists should deliver pain neuroscience edu -
cation alongside other physical therapy interventions, 
such as exercise or manual therapy, to patients with chronic LBP .
APhysical therapists should use active treatments (ie, yoga, 
stretching, Pilates, and strength training) instead of stand-
alone educational interventions for patients with chronic LBP .
EDUCATION FOR POSTOPERATIVE LOW BACK PAIN
BPhysical therapists may use general education (ie, post -
surgical precautions, exercise, and resuming physical ac -
tivity) for patients with LBP following lumbar spine surgery. This 
recommendation applies to those undergoing discectomy or de -
compression surgery. No specific recommendation is provided for 
education for patients undergoing other surgical procedures (eg, 
spinal fusion) due to lack of evidence.
Introduction
Low back pain (LBP) remains a musculoskeletal condition 
with an adverse societal impact. Globally, LBP is highly prev -
alent and a leading cause of disability.137 In the United States, 
LBP remains one of the most common reasons to seek health 
care and, along with neck pain, is the medical condition as -
sociated with the highest overall costs.45,50 Surgical cases are 
the costliest per care episode, but the majority of spending on 
LBP management can be attributed to the significantly larger 
volume of nonoperative care episodes.89 Costs for LBP are es -
calating at a faster pace than overall health care spending and 
come with no evidence suggesting that there are improved 
outcomes (ie, reduced pain or disability) at a societal level.45 
In fact, a population-based study has suggested that rates of chronic LBP have been increasing during this period of 
escalating costs.56
In 2018, a series of articles in the Lancet  called attention to 
the high priority of improving the quality of care for oper -
ative and nonoperative LBP management.29,54,72 Reducing 
variability of care to better represent evidence-informed ap -
proaches is one way quality of care could improve for LBP. 
Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) can serve as an important 
resource in the process of improving quality of care for LBP 
by synthesizing existing evidence and providing recommen -
dations for evidence-informed treatment options. This infor -
mation can then be used to assist individual providers with List of Abbreviations

Acute and Chronic Low Back Pain: Clinical Practice GuidelinesAcute and Chronic Low Back Pain: Clinical Practice Guidelinesclinical decision making and to encourage health systems to 
develop clinical pathways that structure care delivery that is 
aligned with CPG recommendations.64 The development of 
CPGs for LBP is important, but admittedly only the start of 
improving patient care. Delivering guideline-adherent treat -
ment as part of routine clinical practice remains a continuing 
challenge for physical therapists.172,173
SCOPE AND RATIONALE
Rationale
This is an update to the 2012 Academy of Orthopaedic Phys -
ical Therapy (AOPT), formerly the Orthopaedic Section of 
the American Physical Therapy Association (APTA), CPG 
for LBP.38 The 2012 guidelines made recommendations for 
LBP that encompassed a broad scope, including risk fac -
tors, clinical course, diagnosis/classification, differential 
diagnosis, examination, and interventions. Several key con -
siderations guided the 2021 update (see box below). Since 
2012, many additional CPGs for LBP have been published, 
and the primary literature related to LBP has expanded 
exponentially. The proliferation of CPGs has resulted in 
convergent recommendations for topic areas included in 
the 2012 AOPT LBP CPG. For example, a 2020 review of 
11 high-quality musculoskeletal pain CPGs (including 4 
for LBP) identified consistent best-practice recommenda -
tions to (1) ensure care is patient centered, (2) screen for 
red flag conditions, (3) assess psychosocial factors, (4) use 
imaging selectively, (5) undertake a physical examination to 
assess impairments, (6) monitor patient progress, (7) pro -vide education and evidence-based information as a treat -
ment supplement, (8) incorporate physical activity/exercise, 
(9) use manual therapy only as an adjunct to other active 
treatments, (10) offer high-quality, nonsurgical care prior 
to surgery, and (11) try to keep patients at work.100 An in-
press review of 5 high-quality CPGs for LBP produced a 
synthesis of 13 very similar recommendations for screening, 
assessment, and treatment approaches.101 This consistency 
of recommendations for LBP across diagnosis, differential 
diagnosis, and examination was helpful in supporting the 
decision to de-emphasize these topic areas for the updated 
AOPT CPG for LBP. That is, a decision to focus the 2021 
update on treatments was made because diagnosis, differen -
tial diagnosis, and examination recommendations are well 
covered in other guidelines.
The importance of nonpharmacologic treatments is another 
development directly relevant to the 2021 update’s focus 
on treatments. Since the 2012 CPG, recommendations have 
been made for nonpharmacologic interventions as first-
choice treatments for chronic pain conditions and LBP, 
as opposed to commonly prescribed pharmacologic treat -
ments like opioids.47,131 However, these recommendations 
are made broadly, without providing guidance on differen -
tiating the levels of evidence for specific nonpharmacolog -
ic treatments.47,100,131 Accordingly, this AOPT CPG update 
focused on synthesizing new evidence, with the purpose of 
making recommendations for specific nonpharmacologic 
treatments.
Scope
Therefore, the overall objective of the 2021 LBP CPG update 
was to provide recommendations on interventions delivered 
by physical therapists or studied in care settings that includ -
ed physical therapy providers. The health question covered 
by this CPG was to determine which interventions could be 
recommended for their potential in providing effective pain 
relief, functional improvement, and/or disability reduction 
(ie, the primary outcomes for this CPG). The interventions 
in the 2021 CPG were reviewed in 1 of the following catego -
ries: (1) exercise, (2) manual and other directed therapies, (3) 
classification systems, and (4) patient education. Our prima -
ry goal was to make this CPG update applicable to physical 
therapists practicing globally, and, as such, our literature 
search was not limited to studies originating in the United 
States. We acknowledge that there are likely to be differences 
in factors that influence care delivery for LBP that influence 
the applicability of these recommendations. For example, 
differences in health systems, cultural norms, and social de -
terminants of health could all influence the application of 
these recommendations. Physical therapists are the intended 
primary audience, but other stakeholders (eg, patients, the 
public, other provider types, policy makers, and payers) may CONSIDERATIONS FOR THE 2021 CPG UPDATE
• Recommendations focused on interventions: while there are 
many other CPGs for LBP , none specifically addresses inter -
ventions commonly used by physical therapists
• This CPG excluded studies in which interventions were not pro -
vided by physical therapists or in care settings that did not 
include physical therapists
• Recommendations were made for specific subgroups (eg, acute 
or chronic, leg pain, and postoperative care) as allowed by the 
available literature
• Recommendations were further differentiated with World Health 
Organization ICF terminology as study eligibility criteria allowed
• This CPG includes interventions not considered in the 2012 
CPG (eg, dry needling, cognitive functional therapy, and pain 
neuroscience education)
• This CPG includes randomized trials published before July 1, 
2020. Thus, these guidelines cannot account for any more re -
cent individual studies, systematic reviews, or meta-analyses 
that could impact recommendations

Acute and Chronic Low Back Pain: Clinical Practice GuidelinesAcute and Chronic Low Back Pain: Clinical Practice Guidelinesfind application in the 2021 CPG update if there is interest 
in defining evidence-informed care for LBP.
STATEMENT OF INTENT
The 2021 LBP CPG update is not intended to be construed 
or serve as a standard of medical care. Standards of care are 
determined on the basis of all clinical data available for an in -
dividual patient and are subject to change as scientific knowl -
edge and technology advance and patterns of care evolve. The 
parameters of practice described in this CPG should be con -
sidered as guidelines only. Adherence to them will not ensure a successful outcome in every patient, nor should they be con -
strued as including all proper methods of care or excluding 
other acceptable methods of care. The ultimate judgment re -
garding a particular clinical procedure or treatment plan must 
be made based on clinician experience and expertise in light of 
the clinical presentation of the patient, in addition to the avail -
able evidence, available diagnostic and treatment options, and 
the patient’s values, expectations, and preferences. However, 
we suggest that the rationale for significant departures from 
accepted guidelines be documented in the patient’s medical 
records at the time the relevant clinical decision is made.
Methods
Committee members for this CPG update were selected by 
the AOPT based on content expertise in LBP. The commit -
tee was charged with performing a systematic review and 
evaluation of the literature to produce an updated evidence 
synthesis for LBP interventions. Meta-analysis of the extract -
ed literature was not performed because it was considered 
outside the scope of a CPG update. The scope of this update 
was to consider all relevant literature that has been published 
since the search for the 2012 CPG. A large body of LBP litera -
ture was anticipated, and the committee was subdivided into 
4 focus groups, with each category led by a content expert. 
The 4 intervention categories for this CPG update included 
(1) exercise, (2) manual and other directed therapies, (3) clas -
sification systems, and (4) patient education.
Committee members were required to submit conflict-of-in -
terest forms to the AOPT as a condition of authorship. 
Funding and support for CPG development were provided 
through the APTA (CPG grant) and the AOPT, as well as 
support from a dedicated librarian through Duke University. 
These sponsors did not have any influence over the recom -
mendations in this updated CPG. The development of the 
final CPG was guided by an expert in CPG development, fol -
lowing standards set by the Institute of Medicine and the 
APTA Clinical Practice Guideline Process Manual.
LITERATURE SEARCH
A research librarian with experience in systematic reviews 
updated the original searches that had been completed in 
2010 for the 2012 CPG. An initial literature search for this 
CPG was performed in 2016, a revised search was completed 
early in 2020, and the final search was completed in June 
2020. The literature searches completed in 2020 used a 
more inclusive list of search terms and removed duplicates 
from the 2016 search results. Several additional key words 
and subject headings were included to increase comprehen -siveness of the final search. For example, key word synonyms 
for back pain such as “back ache” and “back strain” were add -
ed to all searches, and new concepts such as treatment-based 
classification (TBC), multidimensional clinical framework, 
and cognitive functional therapy (CFT) were added to the 
classification search. All searches were limited by a filter to 
include only randomized clinical trials (RCTs), systematic 
reviews, CPGs, and meta-analyses.
The final search strategy consisted of a total of 8 subsearch -
es, based on the aforementioned 4 intervention categories. 
Multiple subsearches were necessary for the larger treat -
ment categories of exercise and manual and other directed 
therapies, following the previous LBP CPG search strategy. 
Exercise subsearches included centralization, progressive 
endurance, and trunk coordination, while subsearches 
for manual and other directed therapies included manual 
therapies, traction, and mobilization. The final search was 
conducted on June 25, 2020, with no date or language lim -
itations, to capture any new articles based on the addition 
of updated search terms. Each search was conducted in 
MEDLINE via PubMed, Embase (via Elsevier), CINAHL 
Complete (via EBSCOHost), and the Cochrane Library. The 
4 sets of search results were compiled in separate EndNote 
X9 (Clarivate Analytics, Philadelphia, PA) libraries before 
they were added to a Covidence (Veritas Health Innovation 
Ltd, Melbourne, Australia) project that contained search 
results from the 2016 update, which allowed Covidence to 
deduplicate across all searches and filter to a unique set 
of articles for screening. Additional information on the 
search strategies is included in APPENDIX A  (available at www.
jospt.org ). EndNote, Covidence, and Excel (Microsoft Cor -
poration, Redmond, WA) were used to manage literature 
searches, coordinate article selection, and complete criti -
cal appraisals. The search results are presented in APPENDIX 
B (available at www.jospt.org ). Four PRISMA figures that

EVIDENCE SELECTION
The evidence-selection process is summarized in FIGURE 1  and 
described in more detail in the subsequent sections.
Title and Abstract Screening and Review of Full- T ext Articles
Title and abstract screening and full-text article reviews were 
independently conducted, using prespecified inclusion and 
exclusion criteria, by 2 team members. Reviewers followed 
inclusion and exclusion criteria from the 2012 CPG for inclu -
sion in the 2021 CPG update ( APPENDIX D , available at www.
jospt.org ). Conflicts were resolved by a third team member 
and discussed with content experts as needed.
Extraction
For each extracted full-text article, 2 reviewers evaluated ar -
ticle quality using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PE -
Dro) scale for RCTs and the A MeaSurement Tool to Assess 
Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) for systematic reviews. The 
PEDro scale rates 10 internal validity criteria from a Delphi 
list for assessing RCT quality.164 The AMSTAR rates 11 differ -
ent criteria for methodological quality in systematic reviews.146 
Any conflicts regarding PEDro scale and AMSTAR scores were 
resolved by the 2 reviewers assigned to the same article. Dis -
agreements unable to be resolved were discussed with the CPG 
lead author to arrive at the final decision on article score.LEVELS OF EVIDENCE
The level-of-evidence table ( TABLE 1 ) used for the 2021 CPG 
update is provided below, and summary information is in 
APPENDIX E  (available at www.jospt.org ). Given the size of the 
body of LBP literature, the committee made the decision to 
include all systematic reviews but only higher-quality RCTs 
(PEDro scale score, 6 or greater) in the 2021 update. Thus, 
the strength of evidence for all recommendations in this CPG 
is either I or II. The distinction between level I and II evi -
dence was made by focus group members for each interven -
tion category. Because all studies included in this CPG had 
PEDro scale scores of 6 or greater, the distinction between 
level I and II evidence was primarily based on number of 
studies for a given treatment (level I, multiple individual 
RCTs or systematic reviews/meta-analyses), sample size of 
individual RCTs (level I, larger sample size), and length of

FIGURE 1.  The evidence-selection process started with title and abstract screening and included input from 2 reviewers. Titles and abstracts that were rated as “no” by both 
reviewers were excluded (ie, irrelevant source). Titles and abstracts that were rated as “yes” or “maybe” by both reviewers were moved forward to full-text review. Disagreements 
on ratings were resolved before a final decision was made. A similar process occurred during the full-text review, resulting in articles being extracted that were rated as “include” by 
both reviewers. Adapted from the Covidence Knowledge Base ( https:// support.covidence.org/help/how-references-move-through-a-review , accessed June 25, 2020).

Acute and Chronic Low Back Pain: Clinical Practice GuidelinesAcute and Chronic Low Back Pain: Clinical Practice Guidelinesfollow-up times (level I, short- and long-term follow-ups). 
Disagreements on evidence level were resolved by additional 
discussion until consensus was reached.
STRENGTH OF EVIDENCE AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The strength of recommendations was then given a grade to 
reflect the confidence in and impact of the included evidence. 
The strength of recommendation was based on the evidence 
grade from the 2012 CPG (if available) and the composition 
of level I and level II studies from the updated literature. 
Our literature search was limited to RCTs, and there were 
very few examples of clear superiority for treatment options. 
Therefore, we modified the language used to avoid any “must” 
recommendations. Instead, we framed recommendations to 
range from “should” (grade A) to “should not” (grade D). 
These grades and how they were determined are summarized 
in TABLE 2 . Further information related to evidence grading is 
available online ( www.orthopt.org ).
PATIENT SUBGROUPS
Patient subgroups were included in the 2021 CPG update 
to allow for refinement of clinical recommendations. The 
2012 CPG38 differentiated acute, subacute, and chronic LBP; 
however, the 2021 CPG update only differentiates acute from 
chronic LBP. This decision was based on the lack of an ac -
cepted standard for definitions of subacute pain. Since 2012, 
there have been operational definitions for chronic LBP re -
ported (eg, the National Institutes of Health Task Force on 
research standards for chronic LBP and the International 
Classification of Diseases [ICD], 11th revision).42,120 The com -
mittee decided it would be more practical and consistent with 
the existing literature to only differentiate acute from chronic 
LBP in the 2021 CPG update. Additionally, we differentiated presence of leg pain, older adults, and postoperative LBP as 
study eligibility criteria allowed. Therefore, the patient sub -
groups in the 2021 CPG update were:
• Acute or chronic LBP
- Studies that specifically recruited patients with symp -
toms for less than or equal to 6 weeks were grouped 
as acute LBP (ie, this was clearly indicated in the el -
igibility criteria). All other studies were classified as 
chronic LBP
• LBP with leg pain
- Studies that specifically recruited patients with LBP, 
buttock pain, and/or symptoms extending into the leg 
(above or below the knee) were grouped as LBP with 
leg pain (ie, this was clearly indicated in the eligibility 
criteria)
• LBP in older adults
- Studies that specifically recruited patients with LBP who 
were aged 60 years or older
• Postoperative LBP
- Studies that intentionally recruited patients having 
surgery for LBP in conjunction with the treatment of 
interest were grouped as postoperative LBP (ie, this was 
clearly indicated in the eligibility criteria). Studies that 
included patients with a history of surgery for LBP were 
included in other subgroups as indicated (eg, in chronic 
LBP if meeting the symptom duration criterion)
INTERNATIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF FUNCTION
An International Classification of Functioning, Disability 
and Health (ICF) LBP category was included with the rec -
ommendation when a study provided enough information 
in the eligibility criteria. This information was presented to 
be consistent with the 2012 CPG and to match recommenda -
tions to the current CPG’s ICF system. Briefly, the rationale 
for including an ICF category is that it provides additional 
signs and symptoms to support clinical decision making at 
the individual patient level. The ICF subgroups in this up -
dated CPG remain unchanged from the 2012 version, except 
for omitting the subacute group. Refer to the 2012 CPG38 for 
more details on ICF categories for LBP.
CLASSIFICATION CODES
There have been no changes in ICD-10 codes that would im -
pact the 2021 CPG update. Therefore, this part of the CPG 
was not updated or revised, as ICD-10 codes were part of the 
2012 CPG. There is a transition planned to ICD-11 codes, 
which will include coding for primary chronic pain and sec -
ondary chronic pain conditions (eg, musculoskeletal).120,125 
Changes to the ICD-11 codes are likely to be included in a 
future CPG update, as we expect that the opportunity to 
directly code chronic pain will have a noticeable impact on 
clinical classification of LBP.TABLE 2 Grades of Recommendation

Acute and Chronic Low Back Pain: Clinical Practice GuidelinesAcute and Chronic Low Back Pain: Clinical Practice GuidelinesTREATMENT DESCRIPTION
It was outside the scope of the 2021 CPG update to provide 
detailed descriptions for each of the individual treatments 
included in RCTs. However, for the intervention categories 
with many different treatment approaches (ie, exercise, 
manual and other directed therapies), we provide opera -
tional definitions that summarized key treatment character -
istics. These intervention category sections include a table 
providing the treatments and their supporting operational 
definitions.
GUIDELINE REVIEW PROCESS AND VALIDATION
Drafts of the CPG update were reviewed by multiple stake -
holder groups to ensure that the goals and priorities of this 
publication were appropriately developed. Stakeholder 
groups include additional health care providers and orga -
nizations, consumers, patient representatives, and experts 
in physical therapy practice guideline methodology. The 
AOPT provides a network of external stakeholders who 
regularly participate in formal reviews of CPGs, including 
consumer/patient representatives and claims reviewers, 
medical coding experts, academic educators, clinical ed -
ucators, physician specialists, and researchers. The guide -
line draft was also posted for public comment and review 
on www.orthopt.org , and a notification of this posting was 
sent to the members of the AOPT. All comments, sugges -
tions, and feedback from the expert reviewers, the public, 
and consumer/patient representatives were provided to the 
authors and editors for consideration and revisions. Addi -
tional health care providers who reviewed this CPG meth -
odology and publication include physical therapists and 
assistants, physicians and assistants, and chiropractors. 
Acknowledgments of external stakeholders and reviewers 
are provided at the end of the CPG.There is an annual review of the AOPT CPG performed by 
experts in physical therapy practice guideline methodology. 
This review provides feedback to the CPG coordinator and 
editors to continue to improve and develop APTA guidelines.
DISSEMINATION AND IMPLEMENTATION TOOLS
The APTA developed a process of endorsing CPGs to in -
crease the reach and adoption of evidence-based practice 
information. The updated CPG will also be presented at the 
next Combined Sections Meeting in 2022. Future plans for 
dissemination include other educational conferences and 
web inars for clinicians.
In addition to publishing these guidelines in the Journal 
of Orthopaedic &amp; Sports Physical Therapy (JOSPT ), these 
guidelines will be posted on CPG areas of the JOSPT, 
AOPT, and APTA websites, and made available for free 
(open access) on the ECRI Guidelines Trust ( guidelines.
ecri.org ) and the PEDro ( https://pedro.org.au/ ) websites. 
The implementation tools planned to be available for pa -
tients, clinicians, educators, payers, policy makers, and re -
searchers, and the associated implementation strategies, 
are listed in TABLE 3 .
ORGANIZATION OF THE GUIDELINE
Recommendations and accompanying evidence statements 
are presented in separate sections for (1) exercise, (2) man -
ual and other directed therapies, (3) classification systems, 
and (4) patient education. Each section has the same format. 
First, the 2012 CPG recommendations are reviewed, then a 
review of the literature supporting the 2021 updated recom -
mendation is provided, and finally a distillation of the evi -
dence is presented to summarize recommendations. Please 
see the recommendation guidance for key elements.

Acute and Chronic Low Back Pain: Clinical Practice GuidelinesAcute and Chronic Low Back Pain: Clinical Practice GuidelinesCLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES
Intervention: Exercise
EVIDENCE STATEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
2012 Recommendations
The 2012 recommendations were not divided by patient sub -
group (eg, they did not include separate recommendations 
for acute and chronic LBP).
Progressive Endurance Exercise and Fitness Activities
APhysical therapists should consider (1) moderate- 
to high-intensity exercise for patients with chronic 
LBP without generalized pain, and (2) incorporat -
ing progressive, low-intensity, submaximal fitness and en -
durance activities into pain management and health 
promotion strategies for patients with chronic LBP with 
generalized pain.
Trunk Coordination, Strengthening, and Endurance Exercises
APhysical therapists should consider utilizing trunk 
coordination, strengthening, and endurance exer -
cises to reduce LBP and disability in patients with 
subacute and chronic LBP with movement coordination im -
pairments and in patients post lumbar microdiscectomy.
Centralization and Directional Preference 
Exercises and Procedures
APhysical therapists should consider utilizing repeat -
ed movements, exercises, or procedures to promote 
centralization to reduce symptoms in patients with 
acute LBP with related (referred) lower extremity pain. Phys -
ical therapists should consider using repeated exercises in a 
specific direction determined by treatment response to im -prove mobility and reduce symptoms in patients with acute, 
subacute, or chronic LBP with mobility deficits.
Flexion Exercises
CPhysical therapists can consider flexion exercises, 
combined with other interventions such as manual 
therapy, strengthening exercises, nerve mobiliza -
tion procedures, and progressive walking, for reducing pain 
and disability in older patients with chronic LBP with radi -
ating pain.
Exercise training interventions were categorized using the 
operational definitions displayed in TABLE 4 .
EVIDENCE UPDATE
Based on the results of our literature search, the 2021 update 
will include some of the same, but also different, treatment 
categories as did the 2012 CPG.
EXERCISE TRAINING FOR ACUTE LBP
General Exercise Training
IIAluko et al7 compared 6 weeks of specific trunk 
muscle activation exercises added to a trunk 
strengthening and endurance exercise program 
with the exercise program alone in 33 participants with 
acute LBP. This RCT reported no between-group differenc -
es at assessments conducted 3, 6, and 12 weeks after 
enrollment.
TABLE 4 Operational Definitions for Exercise
Intervention Operational Definition
T runk muscle strengthening and endurance exercise Exercise training prescribed to restore or improve strength, endurance, or power of trunk muscles or muscle groups
Specific trunk muscle activation exercise Exercise training prescribed to target specific deep trunk muscles (eg, transversus abdominis, multifidus) using cocontraction 
to alter or restore control or coordination of the lumbopelvic region
Movement control exercise Exercise training prescribed to alter, restore, or retrain control of functional movements and tasks, with feedback on movement 
patterns
General exercise Exercise training prescribed to restore or improve overall strength or endurance of the major muscle groups of the upper/
lower extremities and trunk, including exercises for flexibility/ mobility and aerobic/ conditioning exercises
T runk mobility exercise Exercise training prescribed to restore trunk range of motion or to repeatedly move the trunk in a specific direction to achieve 
a reduction of symptoms
Aerobic exercise Exercise training prescribed to restore or enhance capacity or efficiency of the cardiovascular system
Multimodal exercise Exercise training that combines 2 or more of the interventions described above

Acute and Chronic Low Back Pain: Clinical Practice GuidelinesAcute and Chronic Low Back Pain: Clinical Practice GuidelinesEvidence Synthesis and Rationale
There is a lack of RCTs examining exercise training interven -
tions for patients with acute LBP who do not have related leg 
pain. This paucity of clinical trials is the primary limiting fac -
tor in making a stronger recommendation for exercise train -
ing. A stronger recommendation will require the completion 
of level I RCTs investigating the effects of exercise training in 
patients with acute LBP.
2021 Recommendation
CPhysical therapists can use exercise training inter -
ventions, including specific trunk muscle activa -
tion, for patients with acute LBP.
EXERCISE TRAINING FOR ACUTE LBP WITH LEG PAIN
Muscle Strengthening and Endurance
IIHuber et al79 compared a muscle strengthening and 
endurance exercise intervention, consisting of su -
pine isometric back extension and abdominal exer -
cises, to advice to reduce activity and loading of the spine in 
52 patients with acute back pain with leg pain. Assessments 
were made before treatment and after 20 days. Patients in 
the muscle strengthening and endurance exercise group had 
a greater reduction of pain intensity after 20 days (mean dif -
ference, –1.7 on the numeric pain-rating scale [NPRS]).
Specific Trunk Muscle Activation
IIYe et al170 compared 2 different exercise training 
interventions in 63 young male participants (age, 
20-29 years) with diagnosed lumbar disc hernia -
tion. Patients were randomized to general exercise or specific 
trunk muscle activation exercises for 3 months. Outcomes 
were assessed after 3 months and 1 year. There were no dif -
ferences at the 3-month assessment; however, at 1 year, those 
receiving specific trunk muscle activation had greater im -
provement in back pain and disability (mean group differ -
ence, –6.7 on the Oswestry Disability Index [ODI]).
Evidence Synthesis and Rationale
These 2 RCTs provide evidence of short-term benefit of exercise 
training interventions, specifically muscle strengthening and 
endurance versus advice only. There was support for specific 
trunk muscle activation having a superior long-term benefit 
when compared to general exercise. The reviewed RCTs had 
methodologic limitations in the duration of follow-up and gen -
eralizability of the study participants. Based on the available 
evidence, there is support for incorporating muscle strength -
ening and endurance and specific trunk muscle activation ex -
ercise training interventions for patients with acute LBP with 
leg pain. This would include patients with ICF categories of 
LBP with related lower extremity pain and radiating pain. A 
stronger recommendation will require more level I RCTs.2021 Recommendation
BPhysical therapists may use exercise training inter -
ventions, including trunk muscle strengthening 
and endurance and specific trunk muscle activa -
tion, to reduce pain and disability in patients with acute LBP 
with leg pain.
Gaps in Knowledge
More research is needed to examine exercise training inter -
ventions for patients with acute LBP with and without leg 
pain. There is a need for level I RCTs comparing exercise 
training interventions against usual care or other control in -
terventions to clarify whether exercise training interventions 
provide benefit beyond the favorable natural history of acute 
LBP. There is also a need for direct comparisons of different 
exercise training interventions for patients with acute LBP 
with leg pain. Effort should be made to ensure that individ -
uals recruited into exercise RCTs match demographic and 
clinical characteristics of those seeking care for LBP.
EXERCISE FOR CHRONIC LBP
Muscle Strengthening and Endurance
IRantonen et al133 compared a muscle strengthening 
and endurance exercise intervention to either a 
multidisciplinary rehabilitation program or a self-
care program in an RCT involving 126 patients with chronic 
LBP in an occupational health setting. The group receiving 
muscle strengthening and endurance exercise had greater 
improvement in pain compared to the self-care group after 3 
and 6 months (pain visual analog scale [VAS] between-group 
mean difference, –10 mm for both follow-up occasions; ODI 
between-group mean difference, –4 and –5, respectively). 
There were no differences among the groups after 24 months.
Specific Trunk Muscle Activation
IAn RCT by Macedo et al104 compared specific trunk 
muscle activation exercise to a general exercise pro -
gram with cognitive behavioral principles in 172 
patients with chronic LBP. Assessments at 2, 6, and 12 
months found no difference in pain or disability between 
groups.
IINine RCTs6,9,13,39,95,111,115,153,159 with small sample sizes 
and primarily short-term follow-up compared spe -
cific trunk muscle activation exercise to other ex -
ercise or an active intervention. Comparison exercise 
training interventions were general exercise,6 yoga,39 manual 
therapy,159 movement control exercise using proprioceptive 
neuromuscular facilitation,13 and muscle strengthening and 
endurance.9,95,111,115,153 Results were mixed, with some studies 
finding differences favoring specific trunk muscle activation 
exercise for pain or disability after 4 to 12 weeks6,95,115,153 and

Acute and Chronic Low Back Pain: Clinical Practice GuidelinesAcute and Chronic Low Back Pain: Clinical Practice Guidelinesothers finding no between-group differences.9,13,111 Demirel 
et al39 found yoga to have a greater effect on pain than spe -
cific trunk muscle activation exercise after 6 weeks (mean 
difference, –1.4 on the NPRS). Tagliaferri et al153 found that 
a muscle strengthening and endurance exercise intervention 
combined with manual therapy had a greater effect on dis -
ability than specific trunk muscle activation exercise after 6 
months. Ulger et al159 found that manual therapy had a 
greater effect on pain and disability after 6 weeks than spe -
cific trunk muscle activation exercise (mean difference, –7.5 
on the ODI).
IIFour RCTs12,121,130,169 compared specific trunk muscle 
exercise with a wait-list group,121 modalities 
alone,130 modalities and trunk exercise,12 or trunk 
endurance exercises.169 All 4 RCTs found greater improve -
ment in pain and disability in patients receiving specific 
trunk muscle activation exercise at short-term follow-ups 
ranging from 4 to 11 weeks.
Movement Control
IIFour RCTs with only short-term outcomes com -
pared movement control exercise to other exercise 
training interventions. Gatti et al63 compared 
movement control exercise (balance exercise) to a general 
exercise program in 79 patients with chronic LBP. Both 
groups received flexibility exercises as well. Greater improve -
ment of pain and disability occurred in the movement control 
exercise group after 6 weeks (mean difference, –2.1 on the 
Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire [RMDQ]). Three 
separate RCTs by Areeudomwong and Buttagat12,13 and 
Areeudomwong et al15 examined movement control exercise 
using proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation compared to 
specific trunk muscle activation and a control group in 55 
patients,12 compared to a control group in 42 patients,15 and 
compared to general exercise in 44 patients.13 Results favored 
movement control exercise versus control or general exercise 
after 3 to 4 weeks and after 12 weeks for pain and disabili -
ty,12,13,15 and no differences were found when compared to 
specific trunk muscle activation after 4 weeks.13
Aerobic Exercise
ISitthipornvorakul et al149 performed a systematic 
review and meta-analysis of aerobic exercise using 
a walking intervention for chronic LBP. Nine 
RCTs were included; 4 compared walking intervention 
alone to other interventions. Five studies compared walking 
as an intervention alone to walking in addition to other in -
terventions. For walking alone versus other interventions 
(general exercise, education), the review found moder -
ate-quality evidence of no significant difference between 
groups for pain in the short term (pooled standardized 
mean difference [SMD], 0.07) or long term (pooled SMD, 0.06). Similarly, no differences were found between groups 
for disability level in the short term (pooled SMD, 0.03) or 
long term (pooled SMD, 0.15). For walking plus other inter -
ventions versus other interventions alone, the review found 
low- to moderate-quality evidence of no significant differ -
ence between groups for pain intensity in the short term 
(pooled SMD, 0.04) or long term (pooled SMD, 0.00). Con -
sistent with other findings, low- to moderate-quality evi -
dence found no differences between groups for disability 
level in the short term (pooled SMD, –0.08) or long term 
(pooled SMD, –0.19).
IITwo RCTs compared aerobic exercise to minimal 
intervention or control groups. Bruehl et al28 com -
pared aerobic exercise to a usual activity control 
group in 82 patients with chronic LBP. Posttreatment com -
parisons (6 weeks) found greater reductions in pain intensity 
and pain interference in the group receiving aerobic exercise 
(NPRS between-group mean difference, –1.5 for average pain 
and –1.7 for worst pain). Cuesta-Vargas et al34 compared a 
deep water–running aerobic exercise program along with 
care from a general practice physician to general practice care 
alone in 58 patients with chronic LBP and found differences 
favoring the group receiving the deep water–running aerobic 
exercise program in pain (pain VAS between-group mean 
differences: –14.8 mm at 4 months, –14.2 mm at 6 months, 
–26.0 mm at 12 months) and disability (RMDQ score be -
tween-group mean differences: –3.4 at 4 months, –3.8 at 6 
months, –2.5 at 12 months).
General Exercise
IFour RCTs compared general exercise interventions 
to other exercise training interventions. Iversen et 
al82 found no differences in pain and function 
across 1 year between general exercise and muscle strength -
ening and endurance using resistance bands in 99 patients. 
Harris et al71 compared general exercise to cognitive behav -
ioral therapy or a brief cognitive intervention in 214 patients 
and found no differences in pain and function at 1-year fol -
low-up. Bello et al20 compared a general exercise program to 
a general exercise program using graded activity and found 
no difference between groups after 4 or 12 weeks. Monticone 
et al114 compared a group-based general exercise program to 
a group-based general exercise program combined with cog -
nitive behavioral therapy principles in 150 patients with 
chronic LBP. The group receiving general exercise with cog -
nitive behavioral principles had greater improvements in 
pain and disability after 5 weeks and 1 and 2 years (NPRS 
[0-10] between-group mean differences: –3.1 postinterven -
tion, –1.8 at 12-month follow-up, and –1.9 at 24-month fol -
low-up; ODI score [0-100] between-group mean differences: 
–9.8 postintervention, –15.8 at 12-month follow-up, and 
–15.0 at 24-month follow-up).

Acute and Chronic Low Back Pain: Clinical Practice GuidelinesAcute and Chronic Low Back Pain: Clinical Practice GuidelinesIITwo RCTs compared general exercise to control con -
ditions. An RCT by Masharawi and Nadaf109 com -
pared group-based, non–weight-bearing general 
exercise to a control group in 40 female nurses with chronic 
LBP. Assessments at 4 and 8 weeks found greater improve -
ment in pain (mean difference, –2.2 on the NPRS) and disabil -
ity (mean difference, –5 on the RMDQ) in the group receiving 
general exercise. Jensen et al83 compared general exercise to 
advice to rest and use of a back brace for 100 patients with 
chronic LBP and Modic changes on imaging. There were no 
differences between groups after 10 weeks or 1 year.
Trunk Mobility
IISegal-Snir et al143 compared trunk mobility using 
rotational exercises to a wait-list control in 50 
women (aged 40 to 70 years) with chronic LBP. 
Both groups received education and advice. There were no 
differences between groups for either pain or disability 
postintervention or at 8-week follow-up.
IIShah and Kage145 compared trunk mobility exercise 
consisting of repeated prone extension to manual 
therapy in 40 patients with LBP lasting less than 3 
months. Results after 7 treatment sessions showed greater 
improvement in pain (mean differences, –1.1 and –2.5 on the 
NPRS) and disability (mean differences, –9.3 and –15.9 on 
the ODI) in the group receiving manual therapy.
Multimodal
IBronfort et al27 conducted an RCT (n = 301) com -
paring a multimodal exercise training intervention, 
including specific trunk muscle activation and mus -
cle strength and endurance training, to spinal manipulation 
and a group receiving instruction in a home-based general 
exercise program. There were no differences among the 3 
treatment groups at the 3-month or 1-year follow-up.
IINazzal et al119 compared a general exercise program 
to a multimodal exercise program, including gen -
eral exercise, muscle endurance, and strengthening, 
along with manual therapy in 100 patients and found greater 
improvements in the multimodal group in pain and disability 
after 6, 12, and 24 weeks. Two additional RCTs found no ben -
efit to adding general exercise (deep-water running or aero -
bic exercise training) to a multimodal treatment that included 
education, manual therapy, specific trunk muscle activation, 
and passive modalities.31,35
IIMagalhães et al106,107 compared 2 different multi -
modal exercise programs in 66 patients with chron -
ic LBP. One program used aerobic exercise and 
muscle strengthening and endurance provided with cognitive 
behavioral principles. The other program used a general ex -ercise program and specific trunk muscle activation exercise. 
There were no differences in pain and disability between 
groups at 6-week, 3-month, and 6-month follow-ups.
Evidence Synthesis and Rationale
There are a large number of RCTs examining exercise inter -
ventions for patients with chronic LBP. However, most are 
level II studies with high heterogeneity in patient popula -
tions, small sample sizes, and short-term follow-up, includ -
ing several trials that reported null findings. The available 
level I RCTs support using multimodal programs and trunk 
muscle strengthening and endurance exercise interventions 
for chronic LBP generally and with older adults specifical -
ly. No studies reported harm from exercise training inter -
ventions. Therefore, exercise training interventions can be 
broadly recommended for chronic LBP. More level I RCTs 
are needed to directly compare different types of exercise, 
as there is no clear evidence of the superiority of one form 
of exercise training intervention over another. The duration, 
dosing, and intensity of exercise interventions were highly 
variable across studies, and controlling this variability should 
be a focus in future RCTs.
2021 Recommendations
APhysical therapists should use exercise training in -
terventions, including trunk muscle strengthening 
and endurance, multimodal exercise interventions, 
specific trunk muscle activation exercise, aerobic exercise, 
aquatic exercise, and general exercise, for patients with 
chronic LBP.
BPhysical therapists may provide movement control 
exercise or trunk mobility exercise for patients with 
chronic LBP.
Gaps in Knowledge
There is a need for additional level I RCTs evaluating exercise 
training interventions for patients with chronic LBP. In partic -
ular, RCTs are needed that directly compare different types of 
exercise, examine the optimal way to deliver exercise training 
interventions with respect to dosage and intensity, and target 
exercise interventions to particular subgroups of patients with 
chronic LBP. In addition, the effects of contextual, medical, 
and/or social factors (eg, expectations for treatment, fear of 
movement, comorbid conditions, socioeconomic status) that 
modulate the effects of exercise should also be explored.

(adjusted mean difference, –2.6 on the NPRS) and disability 
(adjusted mean difference, –5.7 on the ODI) posttreatment (8 
weeks) for the specific trunk muscle activation exercise group.
Multimodal
ITwo RCTs examined multimodal exercise training 
interventions versus minimal treatment for patients 
with chronic LBP with leg pain. Hahne et al67 com -
pared a multimodal exercise training intervention including 
trunk mobility exercise and specific trunk muscle activation 
exercise and advice to advice only in 54 patients. Greater im -
provements in back pain (adjusted mean difference, –1.4 points 
on the NPRS) and disability (adjusted mean difference, –7.7 on 
the ODI) favoring the multimodal exercise training interven -
tion were observed after 10 weeks, and in disability (adjusted 
mean difference, –8.2 on the ODI) after 1 year. Albert and Man -
niche3 compared a multimodal exercise training intervention 
including general exercise, trunk strengthening and endurance, 
and specific trunk exercises to a sham exercise program in 181 
patients. All patients received education and advice. There were 
no differences between groups in disability at follow-ups of 8 
weeks and 1 year. There was a trend toward small differences 
in leg pain favoring the multimodal exercise training group.
IMoustafa and Diab116 compared a multimodal exer -
cise training intervention that included general 
exercise and specific trunk muscle activation exer -
cise to that intervention plus exercise intended to correct 
forward head posture in 154 patients with LBP with leg pain 
who were randomly assigned to either intervention. There 
were no differences between groups at 8 weeks after treat -
ment. Differences favoring the group including the postural 
exercise were reported for disability (mean difference, –11.8 
points on the ODI), back pain, and leg pain (mean difference, 
–1.6 on the NPRS) after 2 years.
Evidence Synthesis and Rationale
A total of 3 RCTs comparing exercise training interventions 
to minimal treatment generally support the use of exercise 
training interventions for patients with chronic LBP with leg 
pain. One study examined a specific trunk muscle activation 
exercise program, while the remaining studies used multi -
modal exercise approaches. The studies do not clearly sup -
port one type of exercise training intervention. One RCT with 
a larger sample size supported the inclusion of postural exer -
cise along with a multimodal exercise training intervention.
2021 Recommendation
BPhysical therapists may use exercise training inter -
ventions, including specific trunk muscle activation 
and movement control, for patients with chronic 
LBP with leg pain.EXERCISE FOR CHRONIC LBP WITH MOVEMENT 
CONTROL IMPAIRMENT
IIFour RCTs14,88,124,129 compared specific trunk muscle 
activation exercise to other exercise interventions 
in patients with chronic LBP who also had signs 
associated with the ICF category of movement control im -
pairment. Khodadad et al88 compared specific trunk muscle 
activation exercise to cognitive functional training and a con -
trol group in 52 patients and found no differences among the 
groups after 8 weeks. Three RCTs14,124,129 compared specific 
trunk muscle activation exercises to stretching exercises in 
studies with small sample sizes ranging from 20 to 42 pa -
tients. These RCTs each found better outcomes for the group 
receiving specific trunk muscle activation exercise in the 
short term (6-10 weeks), with 1 RCT129 showing continued 
benefit for disability in the specific trunk muscle activation 
group after 6 months.
IIMacedo et al105 conducted a preplanned secondary 
analysis of an RCT not included in the systematic 
review by Luomajoki et al.103 The RCT compared 
specific trunk muscle activation and a general exercise pro -
gram provided with cognitive behavioral principles in 172 
patients with chronic LBP. Patients with clinical signs of 
movement control impairment via a questionnaire had great -
er improvement in function after 12 months than patients 
with fewer signs of movement control impairment on the 
questionnaire.
Movement Control
IOne systematic review and meta-analysis included 
11 RCTs that examined movement control exercise 
training intervention programs for patients with 
chronic LBP and movement control impairment.103 The sys -
tematic review found that movement control exercise had a 
small effect on pain postintervention (SMD, –0.39; 95% con -
fidence interval [CI]: –0.73, –0.04), with no effect after 1 
year. For disability, movement control exercise had a small 
effect postintervention in 4 of 11studies (SMD, –0.38; 95% 
CI: –0.68, –0.09), with a small effect maintained after 1 year 
(n = 212; SMD, –0.37; 95% CI: –0.69, –0.04).
Evidence Synthesis and Rationale
For patients with clinical findings consistent with movement 
control impairment, there is consistent evidence supporting 
specific trunk activation exercise and movement control ex -
ercise interventions.
2021 Recommendation
APhysical therapists should use specific trunk muscle 
activation and movement control exercise for pa -
tients with chronic LBP and movement control 
impairment.

or which patient characteristics are indicative of positive 
treatment outcomes.
EXERCISE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR 
CHRONIC LBP IN OLDER ADUL TS
ITwo RCTs examined multimodal exercise pro -
grams for older adults. Ammendolia et al8 com -
pared a multimodal general exercise and aerobic 
exercise program to a self-directed exercise program in 104 
adults with lumbar spinal stenosis (mean age, 71 years). The 
group receiving multimodal exercise had greater improve -
ments in pain and disability after 6 months (adjusted mean 
difference, –1.4 on the NPRS). Schneider et al142 compared 
a group-based general exercise program to an individually 
delivered general exercise program with manual therapy 
and to usual medical care from a physiatrist in 259 adults 
over the age of 60 with lumbar spinal stenosis. The group 
receiving individualized general exercise with manual ther -
apy had greater improvement in disability after 2 months 
than either the usual medical care or group-based general 
exercise group (adjusted mean differences: medical care, 
–2.0; 95% CI: –3.6, –0.4; group exercise, –2.4; 95% CI: 
–4.1, –0.8). There were no differences between groups after 
6 months.
IIHicks et al75 compared a muscle strengthening and 
endurance exercise intervention augmented with 
neuromuscular electrical stimulation to passive 
modalities in 64 older adults (age, 60-85 years). The muscle 
strengthening and endurance exercise group had greater im -
provements in pain and function 12 weeks and 6 months post 
intervention (adjusted mean difference at immediate fol -
low-up, –4.8; at 6 months, –5.1 on the ODI).
IIThree RCTs with small sample sizes and short-term 
follow-ups examined general exercise programs in 
older adults with chronic LBP. Vincent et al166 ex-
amined 49 older adults with abdominal obesity (age, 60-85 
years), comparing 3 groups: (1) a general exercise program 
consisting of total body progressive resistance exercises, (2) 
an isolated trunk extensor muscle strengthening exercise 
program, and (3) a control group. The general exercise group 
had greater improvement in disability after treatment (4 
months) than the muscle strengthening group (mean differ -
ence, –2.6 on the ODI and –3.2 on the RMDQ). Both the 
general exercise and muscle strengthening groups had great -
er reduction in pain during movement than the control group 
(mean difference, –0.6 on the NPRS). Zadro et al174 examined 
60 older adults (age, older than 55 years), comparing a gen -eral exercise program provided using video game technology 
to usual care. The group receiving general exercise had great -
er improvements in pain (mean difference, less than 1 point 
on the NPRS) and disability (mean difference, –1.5 points on 
the RMDQ) after 8 weeks. There were no differences between 
groups after 6 months. No adverse events were reported. Ho -
mayouni et al78 compared an aquatic general exercise pro -
gram to a trunk mobility exercise program using flexion and 
extension, along with passive modalities, in 50 patients with 
chronic LBP diagnosed with lumbar spinal stenosis. The 
study found that the aquatic exercise program provided a 
slight benefit for pain and disability outcomes after 8 weeks, 
with no differences between groups after 3 months (mean 
difference, 2.5 on the pain VAS).
Evidence Synthesis and Rationale
There is strong evidence to support the use of general exer -
cise training (including aquatic exercise) for the management 
of chronic LBP in the older adult population. However, ben -
efits within these studies appear to be more related to exer -
cise prescription (ie, the need to have appropriate volume/
intensity and incorporate principles of exercise progression 
intensity) than to a given exercise type.
2021 Recommendation
APhysical therapists should use general exercise 
training to reduce pain and disability in older 
adults with chronic LBP.
EXERCISE FOR POSTOPERATIVE LBP
General Exercise
IAalto et al1 performed an RCT examining 102 pa -
tients receiving open or microscopic decompres -
sion surgery for lumbar spinal stenosis (19 of the 
enrolled patients had additional fusion surgery). A general 
exercise program was compared to standard postoperative 
treatment. No differences between groups were observed at 
3 and 6 months, and at 1- and 2-year follow-ups.
IHebert et al73 performed an RCT examining a gen -
eral exercise program with and without the addition 
of specific trunk muscle activation exercises started 
2 weeks post surgery in 61 patients after lumbar disc surgery. 
Both groups demonstrated a 50% reduction in disability, but 
no additional benefit was gained from adding the specific 
trunk muscle activation when assessed at 10 and 26 weeks.
IIAn RCT by Ogutluler Ozkara et al122 examined 30 
patients following microdiscectomy and compared a 
general exercise program beginning immediately af -
ter surgery to a control group. The general exercise group had

Acute and Chronic Low Back Pain: Clinical Practice GuidelinesAcute and Chronic Low Back Pain: Clinical Practice Guidelinesgreater improvements in disability at 6 and 12 weeks (mean 
difference, –10.4 and –12.6 on the ODI, respectively) and in 
pain at 12 weeks (mean difference, –0.8 on the VAS).
Evidence Synthesis and Rationale
There are few studies examining exercise training interven -
tions for patients following spine surgery. The results provide 
inconsistent evidence regarding general exercise interven -
tions. None of the RCTs reported harm to patients with ex -
ercise training interventions following spine surgery.
2021 Recommendation
CPhysical therapists can use general exercise training 
for patients with LBP following lumbar spine 
surgery.
Gaps in Knowledge
To better inform postoperative care, there is a need for level 
I RCTs evaluating the effects of different exercise training 
interventions in patients following surgery for LBP.
KEY POINTS FOR EXERCISE INTERVENTIONS
Acute LBP
• Many exercise training interventions potentially reduce 
pain and disability for individuals with acute LBP; howev -er, given the available evidence, it is not possible to recom -
mend any one type of exercise.
• Muscle strength and endurance and specific trunk mus -
cle activation exercise interventions have demonstrated 
some benefit for individuals with acute LBP and related 
leg pain.
Chronic LBP
• Exercise training interventions can be broadly recom -
mended to reduce pain and disability for individuals with 
chronic LBP.
• There is no clear evidence of superiority of one exercise 
type or approach over another when exercise protocols are 
directly compared.
Older Adults With Chronic LBP
• Progressive exercise training can be recommended to re -
duce pain and disability in older adults with chronic LBP.
Postoperative LBP
• Exercise training interventions may be recommended to 
reduce pain and disability for individuals with LBP follow -
ing lumbar spine surgery.
• Surgeries in the literature search included lumbar discec -
tomy, spinal fusion, and decompressive surgery (eg, lami -
notomy, hemilaminectomy, or laminectomy).

Intervention: Manual and 
Other Directed Therapies
EVIDENCE STATEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
2012 Recommendations
The 2012 recommendations were not divided by patient sub -
group (eg, they did not include separate recommendations 
for acute and chronic LBP).
Manual Therapy
APhysical therapists should consider utilizing thrust 
joint mobilization procedures to reduce pain and 
disability in patients with mobility deficits and 
acute low back and back-related buttock or thigh pain. 
Thrust and nonthrust joint mobilization procedures can also 
be used to improve spine and hip mobility and reduce pain 
and disability in patients with subacute and chronic low back 
and back-related lower extremity pain.
Lower-Quarter Nerve Mobilization Procedures
CPhysical therapists should consider utilizing low -
er-quarter nerve mobilization procedures to reduce 
pain and disability in patients with subacute and 
chronic LBP and radiating pain.
Traction
DThere is conflicting evidence for the efficacy of 
intermittent lumbar traction for patients with 
LBP. There is preliminary evidence that a sub -
group of patients with signs of nerve root compression, 
along with peripheralization of symptoms or a positive 
crossed straight leg raise test, will benefit from intermit -tent lumbar traction in the prone position. There is mod -
erate evidence that physical therapists should not utilize 
intermittent or static lumbar traction for reducing symp -
toms in patients with acute or subacute, nonradicular LBP 
or in patients with chronic LBP.
2021 UPDATE
Manual and other directed therapies were categorized using 
the operational definitions displayed in TABLE 5 .
EVIDENCE UPDATE
Based on the results of our literature search, the 2021 update 
will include some of the same treatment categories  included 
in the 2012 CPG and also some different ones.
MANUAL AND OTHER DIRECTED 
THERAPIES FOR ACUTE LBP
Thrust or Nonthrust Joint Mobilization
IFritz et al57 conducted a high-quality RCT of 220 
patients with acute LBP and compared treatment 
with thrust mobilization combined with exercise 
and education to usual care. The group receiving mobiliza -
tion with exercise and education had greater improvement in 
disability after 4 weeks and 3 months, although effect sizes 
were small. There were no between-group differences in pain 
or disability at 1 year, or in pain at 4 weeks or 3 months.
TABLE 5 Operational Definitions for Manual and Other Directed Therapies
Intervention Operational Definition
Thrust or nonthrust joint mobilization A continuum of skilled passive movement applied at varying speeds and amplitudes within or at the end range of motion of 
a joint. Thrust procedures are those provided with low amplitude and high velocity
Soft tissue mobilization Skilled passive movement of soft tissue, including fascia, muscles, and ligaments, to reduce pain or improve range of 
motion. T echniques include myofascial release, trigger point therapy, strain/ counterstrain, etc
Neural tissue mobilization Manual therapy techniques intended to enhance the dynamic balance between the relative movement of neural tissues and 
surrounding mechanical interfaces
Massage A general term referring to techniques using the hands to promote relaxation of underlying muscles
Dry needling An intervention that uses a thin filiform needle to penetrate the skin and stimulate underlying myofascial trigger points and 
muscular and connective tissues for the management of pain and movement impairments
T raction An intervention that uses manually or mechanically applied forces with the intention of stretching and distracting the spine

Acute and Chronic Low Back Pain: Clinical Practice GuidelinesAcute and Chronic Low Back Pain: Clinical Practice GuidelinesIIShah and Kage145 compared nonthrust posteri -
or-to-anterior (PA) mobilizations (grades I-IV) to 
prone press-up exercise in 40 patients with acute 
LBP. Only 1 treatment session was provided. Between-group 
comparisons showed significantly greater improvement in 
pain and disability in the group receiving PA mobilizations. 
No long-term follow-up was conducted.
Soft Tissue Mobilization
IITakamoto et al154 conducted a 3-arm RCT with 63 
patients with acute LBP. Patients were randomized 
into 1 of 3 groups: (1) manual compression at trig -
ger points, (2) compression at nontrigger points, or (3) effleu -
rage massage. Subjects received the assigned treatments 3 
times per week over a 2-week period. There was a significant 
difference at 1 week and 1 month post treatment for pain, but 
not for disability, in favor of the group that received manual 
compression at trigger points.
Massage
IIWe identified 1 systematic review58 that included 1 
RCT with 51 participants examining massage for 
acute LBP. This RCT found that 8 sessions of mas -
sage over a 3-week period were superior to inactive controls 
for pain at the 1-week follow-up, but no difference between 
inactive controls and massage for disability was found. No 
long-term follow-up was conducted.171
Evidence Synthesis and Rationale
There are several RCTs examining manual therapy or other 
directed interventions for patients with acute LBP. Of the 
studies included, evidence supports short-term benefits for 
joint mobilizations (2 RCTs), massage (1 RCT), and soft 
tissue mobilization (1 RCT). The duration of treatment in 
these RCTs was short, including no longer than a 3-week 
period. This is an important consideration when applying 
these treatments, as there is no evidence investigating the 
prolonged use of manual therapy or other directed inter -
ventions for acute LBP. Furthermore, most of the included 
studies had a large degree of heterogeneity in intervention 
delivery parameters. The evidence in support of thrust or 
nonthrust joint mobilization was stronger than for other 
directed interventions.
2021 Recommendations
APhysical therapists should use thrust or nonthrust 
joint mobilization to reduce pain and disability in 
patients with acute LBP.
BPhysical therapists may use massage or soft tissue 
mobilization for short-term pain relief in patients 
with acute LBP.Gaps in Knowledge
There is a need for additional level I RCTs evaluating man -
ual and other directed therapy interventions for acute LBP. 
Specifically, more RCTs comparing manual therapy and other 
directed interventions against usual care are needed to clarify 
whether these therapies provide additional benefit beyond 
the natural course of acute LBP. Additionally, level I RCTs 
that directly compare different types of manual therapy and 
other directed interventions are needed for patients with 
acute LBP.
MANUAL AND OTHER DIRECTED THERAPIES  
FOR CHRONIC LBP
Thrust or Nonthrust Joint Mobilization
IWe identified 20 RCTs examining thrust or non -
thrust mobilization, 8 of which used a control or 
sham comparator.25,44,49,53,76,93,163,165 Dosing and fol -
low-up periods varied across these RCTs. Seven of these RCTs 
found short-term improvement in pain and disability out -
comes for the group receiving mobilization.44,49,53,76,93,163,165 
Sample sizes for these 7 RCTs ranged from 25 to 75, with 
none including long-term follow-up outcome measures. 
Some RCTs provided mobilization combined with other in -
terventions, including neural mobilization49 or other physical 
therapy interventions.93 One small pilot RCT found no differ -
ence in pain or function between mobilization and sham 
treatment.25
Seven RCTs compared thrust or nonthrust mobilization 
with active treatment comparators in patients with chronic 
LBP.4,36,113,140,153,155,160 Two RCTs compared thrust or nonthrust 
mobilization with electrotherapy.4,160 Both RCTs favored the 
group receiving mobilization. Five RCTs36,113,140,153,155 com -
pared thrust or nonthrust mobilization with different types 
of exercise. Two of these RCTs found that nonthrust mobi -
lization did not provide greater short-term improvement in 
pain or disability than did exercise interventions,36,113 with 1 
of these RCTs finding greater improvement for a group re -
ceiving specific trunk activation exercise.113 Another RCT155 
comparing thrust mobilization with an exercise program of 
stretching and general exercise found that the mobilization 
group had greater improvement in short-term (5 weeks) pain 
and disability. Two RCTs investigated mobilization combined 
with ergonomic advice140 or muscle strengthening and en -
durance exercise,153 with the groups receiving mobilization 
experiencing greater short-term improvement in pain and 
quality of life than groups receiving other types of exercise 
without mobilization.
Five RCTs examined the addition of mobilization to an ac -
tive treatment that was received by all patients.51,65,118,141,175 Two 
RCTs that added mobilization to exercise and education51 or

Acute and Chronic Low Back Pain: Clinical Practice GuidelinesAcute and Chronic Low Back Pain: Clinical Practice Guidelinesto cognitive behavioral treatment and exercise65 found no 
additional benefit of adding the mobilization intervention. 
Three RCTs found greater short-term improvements in pain 
and disability when mobilization was added to standard 
physical therapy,175 laser therapy plus exercise,118 or exercise 
plus electrotherapy.141
IFive RCTs compared different delivery methods of 
mobilization for patients with chronic LBP. Two 
RCTs30,33 compared thrust and nonthrust mobiliza -
tion techniques to each other. One RCT30 found greater im -
provement in short-term disability for the group receiving 
thrust mobilization. The other RCT33 had a larger sample size 
(n = 149) and reported no significant between-group differ -
ences. Two RCTs41,46 compared mobilization techniques that 
were targeted to specific spinal segments or regions to mobi -
lization techniques that were nonspecific. These RCTs found 
no differences in outcomes for specific versus nonspecific 
techniques. The larger RCT41 (n = 148) found that both 
groups improved in terms of an immediate decrease in pain, 
but no significant between-group differences were observed. 
One RCT86 of 32 women with chronic LBP compared thrust 
mobilization directed at 2 regions (the sacroiliac joint and 
lumbar spine) to thrust mobilization directed at a single re -
gion (the sacroiliac joint). The authors found a single session 
of thrust mobilization directed at 2 regions to be more effec -
tive for improving short-term (48 hours and 1 month) dis -
ability than sacroiliac joint mobilization alone.
Soft Tissue Mobilization
IIWe identified 6 RCTs that examined soft tissue mo -
bilization for patients with chronic LBP. None of 
these studies conducted a long-term follow-up. Two 
of these RCTs16,17 compared myofascial release to sham myo -
fascial release and found that the group receiving soft tissue 
mobilization with myofascial release had greater improve -
ment in short-term pain and disability. Another RCT24 com -
pared the combination of myofascial release and thrust 
mobilization to thrust mobilization alone and found no sig -
nificant between-group differences. An RCT by Dayanir et 
al37 compared 3 separate soft tissue mobilization techniques 
(manual pressure release, strain/counterstrain, and integrat -
ed neuromuscular inhibition), each combined with a home 
exercise program, to a group receiving only the home exercise 
program. The group receiving strain/counterstrain had 
slightly greater improvement in pain and disability compared 
to the other groups. Kotteeswaran et al92 compared dynamic 
soft tissue mobilization of the hamstring with a stretching 
program in young adults (age, 20-35 years) with chronic LBP 
and found the soft tissue mobilization to be more effective for 
short-term reduction of pain. Finally, 1 RCT144 compared 4 
groups that each received specific trunk activation exercises, 
with one group also receiving a combination of nonthrust mobilization and soft tissue mobilization, another receiving 
elastic taping, and another receiving reflexology. There were 
no differences between groups in pain or disability at 4-week 
follow-up.
Massage
IWe identified 1 systematic review58 that included 24 
RCTs examining massage for chronic LBP. The sys -
tematic review found that massage was superior to 
inactive controls for pain and disability in the short term, but 
not in the long term. When compared to active controls, mas -
sage was superior for the outcome of pain, in both the short 
and long term, but no differences were found for function in 
either the short or long term. There were no reports of seri -
ous adverse events. The evidence was judged to be of low to 
very low quality.
IWe identified 6 RCTs examining massage for pa -
tients with chronic LBP that were not included in 
the systematic review. Two RCTs19,84 compared an 
exercise intervention provided with or without massage. Both 
RCTs found that the addition of massage provided superior 
outcomes compared to those provided by exercise alone. Two 
RCTs compared specific types of massage (Thai and Ayurve -
dic massage) with other active comparator interventions. 
One of these RCTs94 compared Ayurvedic massage with stan -
dard massage and found that the Ayurvedic method led to 
greater short-term (2 and 4 weeks) improvement in pain, but 
not in disability. The other, larger RCT85 (n = 120) compared 
traditional Thai massage with joint mobilization and found 
that both interventions were equally effective for short-term 
(4 weeks) reductions in pain and disability. One RCT98 com -
pared the effect of interferential current electromassage to 
superficial massage in patients with chronic LBP and found 
the electromassage intervention to be superior for short-term 
improvements in pain and disability. Finally, 1 RCT177 inves -
tigated massage with and without a preparatory phase (pa -
tients were provided active feedback during the massage, and 
the preparatory phase included pleasant touch before initi -
ating the massage) and language as therapy for LBP and 
found that massage improved pain and disability at short-
term follow-up, with the experimental group having a more 
immediate response.
Neural Mobilization
IWe identified 1 systematic review151 that included 7 
RCTs examining neural mobilization in patients 
with chronic LBP with leg pain and 2 RCTs exam -
ining patients with chronic LBP without leg pain. The review 
concluded that neural mobilization was superior to minimal 
interventions for pain and disability in patients with chronic 
LBP with leg pain, but neural mobilization was not superior 
to comparator interventions.

Acute and Chronic Low Back Pain: Clinical Practice GuidelinesAcute and Chronic Low Back Pain: Clinical Practice GuidelinesIIWe identified 4 additional RCTs not included in the 
systematic review that examined neural mobiliza -
tion in patients with chronic LBP with leg pain. 
One RCT49 evaluated advice to stay active, with and without 
the addition of neural mobilization. The group receiving sci -
atic nerve mobilization had greater improvement in pain and 
disability at 4 weeks compared to the advice-only group. Two 
RCTs examined the addition of neural mobilization for the 
sciatic nerve to an exercise program. Bhatia et al21 examined 
the addition of neural mobilization to a physical therapy ex -
ercise program and found greater short-term (4 weeks) im -
provements in pain and disability in the group also receiving 
neural mobilization. Plaza-Manzano et al127 examined the 
addition of neural mobilization to a specific trunk muscle 
activation exercise program and found no significant differ -
ence between groups at short-term follow-up (4 weeks). Sat -
pute et al141 added neural mobilization combined with 
nonthrust mobilization to a program of exercise and electro -
therapy, and found that the neural mobilization group had 
significant improvements in pain and disability compared to 
the group receiving only exercise and electrotherapy imme -
diately postintervention, as well as at 3- and 6-month 
follow-ups.
Dry Needling
IIWe identified 3 RCTs examining dry needling inter -
ventions provided by physical therapists to patients 
with chronic LBP, each with only short-term out -
comes. Griswold et al66 compared dry needling and nonthrust 
mobilization and found no significant differences in pain and 
disability after 3 weeks. Tüzün et al158 conducted a small RCT 
(n = 34) that compared dry needling to a comparison group 
receiving passive modalities and a home exercise program. 
The group receiving dry needling had greater improvement 
in pain immediately following the last treatment session. 
There was no long-term follow-up. Mahmoudzadeh et al108 
examined 58 patients with chronic LBP with leg pain. All 
participants received physical therapy, with or without dry 
needling. The group receiving dry needling along with phys -
ical therapy experienced significantly greater improvements 
in pain and disability at the end of treatment and at 2-month 
follow-up.
IIAn RCT by Wang-Price et al167 compared 2 dry nee -
dling techniques (with and without needle manip -
ulation) for a single treatment session. There were 
no significant differences between groups immediately 
posttreatment.
Traction
IWe identified 7 RCTs examining traction for pa -
tients with chronic LBP. Six of these 
RCTs22,40,43,117,128,156 examined the addition of traction to another treatment in patients with chronic LBP with leg 
pain. Bilgilisoy Filiz et al22 conducted a study of 125 patients 
who were randomized to mechanical lumbar traction in ei -
ther the prone or supine position, along with physical thera -
py, or to physical therapy alone (without traction). The 
combination of prone traction and physical therapy showed 
greater improvement in pain and function at the end of treat -
ment (15 sessions) compared to the physical therapy–only 
group. Moustafa and Diab117 conducted an RCT comparing 
hot packs and interferential therapy, with and without the 
addition of lumbar extension traction. The traction group 
showed significant improvements in pain and disability at the 
end of treatment and 6-month follow-up. Diab and Mousta -
fa43 compared stretching and heat with and without the ad -
dition of lumbar extension traction, with the traction group 
showing significant improvements in pain and disability at 
the end of treatment and at 6 months.
Other studies examining the addition of traction to mobi -
lizing exercise,156 to specific trunk muscle activation exercise 
with massage and electrotherapy,40 and to a standard phys -
ical therapy program using an inversion device128 found no 
differences between groups in pain or disability outcomes. 
Thackeray et al156 conducted an RCT of 120 patients with 
LBP with leg pain randomized to receive an extension-ori -
ented physical therapy approach, with or without the ad -
dition of lumbar traction. No significant differences were 
found in pain or disability at the end of treatment and at 
6-month or 1-year follow-up. Demirel et al40 performed a 
pilot RCT of 20 patients, comparing a combination of deep 
friction massage, electrotherapy, and stabilization exercises 
with and without the addition of lumbar traction. There 
were no significant between-group differences in pain or 
function observed at the end of treatment. An RCT con -
ducted by Prasad et al128 compared physical therapy with or 
without the addition of gravity-inversion traction in 24 pa -
tients. There were no significant between-group differences 
in pain or disability at the end of treatment. Last, another 
RCT81 compared high- and low-force mechanical traction in 
patients with chronic LBP and radiating pain, and found no 
difference between groups based on the amount of traction 
force.
Evidence Synthesis and Rationale
There are numerous studies examining manual therapy and 
other directed interventions for chronic LBP. There is good 
evidence in support of thrust or nonthrust joint mobiliza -
tion for short-term benefit for pain and disability associat -
ed with chronic LBP. There was no evidence of differences 
based on mobilization technique. Other directed interven -
tions had less consistent findings. Some RCTs found evi -
dence of benefit of either soft tissue mobilization or massage 
when added to other interventions (joint mobilization,

tients who would fit the ICF category of radiating pain, evi -
dence supports the addition of neural mobilization to other 
interventions (exercise, physical therapy). One level II RCT 
supported adding dry needling to a physical therapy program 
for patients with chronic LBP with leg pain. Multiple RCTs 
examined traction for chronic LBP with leg pain, but there 
was conflicting evidence for the efficacy of lumbar traction. 
A few studies showed small improvements in short-term 
pain and disability when mechanical traction was combined 
with heat, stretching, and/or standard physical therapy, or 
in comparison to directed modalities. However, the majority 
of studies showed no additional benefit in pain or disability 
when traction was added to a program of exercise and joint 
mobilization.
2021 Recommendations
APhysical therapists should use thrust or nonthrust 
joint mobilization to reduce pain and disability in 
patients with chronic LBP.
BPhysical therapists may use thrust or nonthrust 
joint mobilization to reduce pain and disability in 
patients with chronic LBP with leg pain.
BPhysical therapists may use soft tissue mobilization 
or massage in conjunction with other treatments to 
reduce pain and disability in the short term in pa -
tients with chronic LBP.
CPhysical therapists can consider the use of dry nee -
dling in conjunction with other treatments to re -
duce pain and disability in the short term in 
patients with chronic LBP.BPhysical therapists may use neural mobilization in 
conjunction with other treatments for short-term 
improvements in pain and disability in patients 
with chronic LBP with leg pain.
DPhysical therapists should not use mechanical trac -
tion for patients with chronic LBP with leg pain, 
based on the lack of benefit when added to other 
interventions.
Gaps in Knowledge
There is a need for more level I RCTs to examine manual 
therapy and other directed interventions for patients with 
chronic LBP, with or without leg pain. Because of the pref -
erence for active interventions, study designs examining the 
effects of adding manual and other directed therapies to 
exercise can inform the potential value of these treatments 
when multimodal approaches are used for patient care. In 
addition, future RCTs examining manual and other directed 
therapies should incorporate longer follow-up times, as ex -
isting trials often only include immediate posttreatment or 
short follow-up for primary end points.
KEY POINTS FOR MANUAL AND OTHER  
DIRECTED THERAPIES
Acute LBP
• Thrust or nonthrust joint mobilization, massage, and soft 
tissue mobilization have some evidence of reducing pain 
and disability for individuals with acute LBP.
• There is no evidence to support the use of other directed 
therapies for individuals with acute LBP.
Chronic LBP
• Most studies support only short-term effectiveness for any 
of the therapies included in this CPG update (ie, group dif -
ferences favoring the therapy were not observed at long-
term follow-up).
• Traction is not supported by the current evidence as benefi -
cial when added to other interventions for individuals with 
chronic LBP with leg pain.

Intervention: Classification Systems
EVIDENCE STATEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
2012 Recommendations
The 2012 recommendations were not divided by patient sub -
group (ie, they did not include separate recommendations for 
acute and chronic LBP).
Classification systems represent decision-making strategies 
that are designed to help physical therapists identify import -
ant subgroups of patients with LBP and match the subgroups 
to the interventions most likely to be beneficial to them.87 The 
2012 CPG noted that a few RCTs were available that exam -
ined specific classification systems, but the CPG did not pro -
vide recommendations about these systems.38 The following 
endorsements were made regarding classification in general 
in the 2012 CPG.
1. Emphasis in the development of subgrouping methods 
has been placed on patterns of signs and symptoms from 
the clinical examination.
2. The development of classification systems has been iden -
tified as a priority among researchers in the primary care 
management of patients with LBP.
3. The best available evidence supports a classification ap -
proach that de-emphasizes identifying specific anatomical 
lesions after red flag screening is completed.Because the 2012 CPG did not make recommendations about 
specific classification systems, the authors considered evi -
dence from RCTs cited in the previous CPG in these updated 
recommendations when there were no RCTs published since 
the previous CPG literature search.
2021 Update
Classification systems were categorized using the operation -
al definitions presented in TABLE 6 . Based on the results of 
our literature search, the 2021 update will include some of 
the same, but also different, treatment categories as did the 
2012 CPG.
CLASSIFICATION SYSTEMS FOR ACUTE LBP
Mechanical Diagnosis and Therapy
ILam et al96 performed a systematic review of 4 
RCTs that found that Mechanical Diagnosis and 
Therapy (MDT) is not superior to other rehabilita -
tion interventions such as manual therapy plus exercise, 
exercise, or education for addressing pain or disability 
outcomes in patients with acute LBP. There were no RCTs 
comparing MDT with control conditions.
TABLE 6 Operational Definitions for Classification Systems
Intervention Operational Definition
Mechanical Diagnosis and Therapy Classification method based on changes in low back pain (and/ or lower extremity) symptoms in response to direction-specific, repeated 
lumbar spine movements or sustained postures. Findings are used to classify patients into different syndromes (ie, derangement, 
dysfunction, or postural) that guide the treatment approach
T reatment-based classification Classification method to guide initial treatment approach (manipulation, stabilization, specific exercise, or traction) based on specific 
initial assessment findings, including but not limited to patient history, clinical presentation, and physical examination
Movement system impairment Classification method based on impaired trunk movements and postures associated with low back pain symptoms observed during a 
standardized examination. T est results are used to classify patients based on observed lumbar movement or alignment impairments 
(rotation, extension, flexion, rotation with extension, or rotation with flexion), with subgroup assignment guiding the initial treatment 
approach to match specific signs and symptoms
Cognitive functional therapy Classification method that uses an integrated behavioral approach for individualizing the management of low back pain Pathoanatomical, 
physical, psychological, social, lifestyle, and health-related risk factors are assessed, with nonmodifiable barriers and a modifiable 
target for change identified to guide treatment based on 3 components (“making sense of pain,” “exposure with control,” and “lifestyle 
change”). Formerly called O’Sullivan’s classification system
Prognostic risk stratification Classification method that identifies patients at different levels of risk for persistent pain (low, medium, high) using a multidimensional 
screening tool, with each risk category associated with different treatment pathways. Examples include the ST arT Back T ool
Pathoanatomic-based classification Classification method based on pathoanatomic-based findings from examination that could cause low back pain Subgroups are defined 
by symptom location and response to examination procedures and used to guide the treatment approach

Acute and Chronic Low Back Pain: Clinical Practice GuidelinesAcute and Chronic Low Back Pain: Clinical Practice GuidelinesEvidence Synthesis and Rationale
We identified 1 systematic review published since the last 
CPG comparing the effectiveness of MDT to other interven -
tions for patients with acute LBP. There was no evidence that 
MDT was superior to other common interventions for acute 
LBP. Our search failed to identify any additional RCTs com -
paring the effectiveness of MDT to other classification sys -
tems or examining the effectiveness of classification systems 
other than MDT for patients with acute LBP.
2021 Recommendations
BPhysical therapists may use TBC to reduce pain and 
disability in patients with acute LBP. This recom -
mendation is unchanged from the 2012 CPG.
CPhysical therapists can use MDT to reduce pain and 
disability in patients with acute LBP.
Gaps in Knowledge
The MDT classification system has been the most studied 
for acute LBP. Accordingly, there is a need for level I RCTs 
investigating other classification systems for patients with 
acute LBP.
CLASSIFICATION SYSTEMS FOR CHRONIC LBP
IWe identified 1 systematic review including 12 RCTs 
that found some evidence to support using a classi -
fication system for patients with chronic LBP.176 
Another systematic review examining different classification 
systems for patients with chronic LBP included 6 RCTs of 
moderate-to-high methodological quality and found that 
only 1 RCT supported the use of a classification-based 
approach.135
IOne RCT74 (n = 101) compared the effectiveness of 
providing matched versus unmatched treatment 
using the TBC and movement system impairment 
(MSI) classification systems and found no differences based 
on the classification approach used.
Evidence Synthesis and Rationale
Our search identified 2 systematic reviews and 1 RCT pub -
lished since the 2012 CPG comparing the effectiveness of 
classification systems (in general) for patients with chronic 
LBP. The results failed to find consistent, high-quality ev -
idence of benefit when a classification approach was com -
pared to not using a classification approach or to another 
classification approach. No recommendations were made 
based on these studies. They were included in the CPG up -
date to provide a general overview of the evidence base for 
classification systems.Mechanical Diagnosis and Therapy
IWe identified 3 systematic reviews examining 
MDT. A review by Halliday et al68 of 23 RCTs com -
pared MDT to other interventions. Delivery of 
MDT was categorized as “adherent” to the principles of 
MDT or “nonadherent.” Studies investigating adherent 
MDT found greater reductions in pain (15.0 points on a 
100-point scale) and disability (11.7 points) after 3 months 
compared to RCTs with “nonadherent” MDT. Another sys -
tematic review identified 7 RCTs that compared the effec -
tiveness of MDT to other interventions in patients with 
chronic LBP. Lam et al96 found moderate- to high-quality 
evidence that MDT is superior to other interventions for 
reducing pain (–0.33 points) and disability (–0.28 points) 
following treatment. Another systematic review identified 
10 RCTs, 2 of which directly compared MDT to specific 
trunk muscle activation exercise in patients with chronic 
LBP.5 There was no difference between MDT and specific 
trunk muscle activation exercises for pain and disability fol -
lowing treatment.
IOne RCT59 (n = 148) compared MDT with a back 
school intervention and found short-term benefit 
for MDT for disability (RMDQ mean difference, 
2.37), but not for pain, at 4-week follow-up. There were no 
differences between groups at 6-month follow-up. A sec -
ondary analysis of this RCT found that older patients had 
more benefit from MDT at the 4-week follow-up than 
younger patients (RMDQ mean difference, 1.27).60 Another 
RCT126 (n = 350) compared MDT to manual therapy as an 
adjunct to information and advice in patients with chronic 
LBP who demonstrated centralization or peripheralization. 
Results favored MDT for disability after 2 and 12 months 
(RMDQ mean difference, 1.5 at both time points). No dif -
ferences were found for pain. A third RCT61 (n = 148) com -
pared MDT to placebo interventions in patients with 
chronic LBP and found short-term benefit of MDT for pain 
(NPRS mean difference, –1.0), but not for disability, at 
5-week follow-up. No differences were found at the 6- or 
12-month follow-up.61
IIA small RCT70 compared MDT to motor control 
exercise in patients with chronic LBP who had a 
directional preference on clinical examination. A 
small difference in perceived benefit was found at 8-week 
follow-up. No differences between groups for perceived ben -
efit, pain, or disability were found at 12-month follow-up.69
Treatment-Based Classification

come adults with chronic LBP compared educa -
tion, yoga, and physical therapy provided using a

Acute and Chronic Low Back Pain: Clinical Practice GuidelinesAcute and Chronic Low Back Pain: Clinical Practice Guidelinesdisability at 12-week follow-up. Physical therapy provided 
using TBC was superior to education for pain at 12-week fol -
low-up (mean difference, 0.84). There were no differences 
between groups at 12-month follow-up. Another large RCT10 
(n = 156) compared a TBC approach with usual physical ther -
apy in patients with chronic LBP. There were no differences 
between groups for any of the outcomes at the 2-, 6-, or 
12-month follow-up.
Movement System Impairment
IOur search identified 3 high-quality RCTs pub -
lished since the last CPG comparing the MSI clas -
sification system to other interventions for patients 
with chronic LBP. A large (n = 101) RCT162 compared the MSI 
classification treatment to nonclassification treatment in pa -
tients with chronic LBP. No differences were found between 
groups after treatment (8-week follow-up) or at 12-month 
follow-up for pain or disability. A large (n = 148) RCT18 com -
pared MSI classification treatment to treatment with symp -
tom-guided stretching and strengthening exercises in people 
with chronic LBP. There were no differences between groups 
for pain or disability at 2-month follow-up.
IIA small (n = 39) RCT90 compared MSI classification 
treatment to a single education session in patients 
with chronic LBP, with clinical examination find -
ings associated with a lumbar extension-rotation pattern. 
There was a benefit for the MSI classification treatment for 
pain (VAS mean difference, 17.71) and disability (ODI mean 
difference, 5.47) at 6-week follow-up.
Cognitive Functional Therapy
IIA small (n = 49) RCT147 compared CFT treatment 
with a generalized postural intervention in patients 
with chronic LBP and clinical findings of a flexion 
or extension pattern. There was benefit for the CFT group for 
disability (RMDQ mean difference, 3.8) and pain (mean dif -
ference, 2.2) at 4-week follow-up. Another small (n = 70) 
RCT99 compared CFT and general exercise in patients with 
chronic LBP and clinical findings of a movement control im -
pairment. Results favored the CFT group for disability at 3 
months (RMDQ mean difference, 2.4) and 12 months 
(RMDQ mean difference, 1.7).99
Prognostic Risk Stratification
IOur search identified 1 high-quality RCT published 
since the literature search for the 2012 CPG that 
compared prognostic risk stratification to nonstrat -
ified current best practice.77 This large (n = 851) RCT found 
benefits for treatment based on prognostic risk stratification 
using the STarT Back Tool for disability at 4-month (RMDQ 
mean difference, 1.8) and 12-month (RMDQ mean differ -
ence, 1.1) follow-ups. The pain outcome favored prognostic risk stratification at 4-month follow-up (mean difference, 
0.55), with no difference at 12-month follow-up. Patients re -
ceiving stratified care were also more likely to be satisfied 
with treatment at 4-month follow-up and took fewer days off 
work due to LBP at the 12-month follow-up.
Pathoanatomic-Based Classification
IOur search identified 1 RCT52 published since the 
2012 CPG that compared pathoanatomic-based 
classification with guideline-based advice or advice 
alone. This large (n = 300) RCT found benefit for pathoana -
tomic-based classification for pain at 10-week (mean differ -
ence, 1.3) and 6-month (mean difference, 0.90) follow-ups. 
There was no difference between groups for pain at the 
12-month follow-up. The pathoanatomic-based classification 
showed benefit for disability at 10-week (ODI mean differ -
ence, 4.7), 6-month (ODI mean difference, 5.4), and 
12-month (ODI mean difference, 4.3) follow-ups.
Evidence Synthesis and Rationale
The largest number of studies published since the 2012 CPG 
have examined MDT for patients with chronic LBP. Two of 
the 3 published systematic reviews supported the use of MDT 
to reduce pain and disability for chronic LBP, and several of 
the RCTs found a reduction in pain or disability in the short 
term, with small or moderate effect sizes, but did not report 
differences at longer-term follow-ups. There is some evidence 
to suggest that MDT may be more effective when applied in 
an adherent fashion or matched to specific examination find -
ings related to directional preference. Two RCTs compared 
the effectiveness of TBC to other interventions. These RCTs 
suggested that TBC may be superior to minimal interven -
tion (education) but is comparable to other active treatment 
approaches (yoga and usual physical therapy). Three RCTs 
investigated the effectiveness of MSI. The high-quality RCTs 
suggested that MSI is similar to other active comparator 
treatments, while evidence from a low-quality RCT suggested 
that MSI may have short-term benefits when matched to spe -
cific clinical examination findings. Two RCTs supported the 
use of CFT for chronic LBP to reduce pain and disability at 
short- and long-term follow-ups. A single level I RCT (each) 
supports the use of prognostic risk stratification and patho -
anatomic-based classification to reduce pain and disability. 
The magnitude of the differences supporting these classi -
fication systems ranged from small to moderate, and some 
systems were associated with differences noted at short- and 
long-term follow-ups.
2021 Recommendations
BPhysical therapists may use MDT, prognostic risk 
stratification, or pathoanatomic-based classifica -
tion to reduce pain and disability in patients with 
chronic LBP.

Gaps in Knowledge
Additional level I RCTs examining classification systems in -
volving patients with chronic LBP are needed. There is also 
a need for RCTs directly comparing different classification 
systems. Some classification systems have only been tested 
in specific countries or used specially trained physical thera -
pists. The generalizability of the findings from these studies 
should be investigated.KEY POINTS FOR CLASSIFICATION SYSTEMS
Acute LBP
• There is no evidence directly comparing the effectiveness of 
different classification systems for patients with acute LBP.
Chronic LBP
• Some evidence supports the notion that treatments in -
formed by MDT, CFT, prognostic risk stratification, and 
pathoanatomic-based classification lead to reduced pain 
and disability in patients with chronic LBP.
• No evidence exists to support the notion that treatment in -
formed by any single classification system is more effective 
than another for reducing pain and disability in patients 
with chronic LBP.

Intervention: Patient Education
EVIDENCE STATEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
2012 Recommendation
The 2012 recommendations were not divided by patient sub -
group (ie, they did not include separate recommendations for 
acute and chronic LBP).
BPhysical therapists should not utilize patient educa -
tion and counseling strategies that either directly or 
indirectly increase the perceived threat or fear asso -
ciated with LBP, such as education and counseling strategies 
that (1) promote extended bed rest or (2) provide in-depth, 
pathoanatomical explanations for the specific cause of the pa -
tient’s LBP. Patient education and counseling strategies for 
patients with LBP should emphasize (1) the promotion of the 
understanding of the anatomical/structural strength inherent 
in the human spine, (2) the neuroscience that explains pain 
perception, (3) the overall favorable prognosis of LBP, (4) the 
use of active pain coping strategies that decrease fear and catas-
trophizing, (5) the early resumption of normal or vocational 
activities, even when still experiencing pain, and (6) the impor -
tance of improvement in activity levels, not just pain relief.
2021 Evidence Update
Based on the results of our literature search, the 2021 update 
will include some of the same, but also different, treatment 
categories as did the 2012 CPG.
EDUCATION FOR PATIENTS WITH ACUTE LBP
Education and Advice
ITraeger et al157 performed a large (n = 202) place -
bo-controlled RCT of adults with acute LBP. The 
investigators compared intensive patient education 
over two 1-hour sessions that included information on pain 
and biopsychosocial contributors, plus self-management tech -
niques, to placebo patient education (active listening without 
information or advice). This study found a small benefit of 
patient education for disability at 1 week and 3 months, but 
not at 6 or 12 months. There was no additional benefit of in -
tensive patient education for pain intensity at any time point.
IIAn RCT80 (n = 30) in adults with acute LBP found 
a moderate-to-large benefit of adding health coach -
ing by telephone to usual physical therapy for mea -
sures of patient-specific functioning (Patient-Specific 
Functional Scale) after 12 weeks (mean difference, 3.0 points; 
95% CI: 0.7, 5.4), with a corresponding standardized effect size (Hedges’ g = 1.1). No additional benefit of health coach -
ing was seen at any time on the ODI.
IIAn RCT123 (n = 109) of adults with acute severe LBP 
found no difference in 1-week pain intensity trajec -
tory following treatment advice to “stay active in 
spite of pain” versus advice to “adjust activity to the pain.”
Evidence Update
There were 3 RCTs that evaluated the use of different types of 
education strategies among patients with acute LBP. Two of 
these evaluated the addition of intensive education to phys -
ical therapy, and they supported the short-term benefits of 
education for disability and functional end points, but not 
for pain intensity. In particular, the level I RCT reported a 
small benefit for disability at short-term follow-up, but not 
at long-term follow-up, and no additional benefit of intensive 
patient education for pain intensity.
2021 Recommendation
BPhysical therapists may use active education strat -
egies rather than passive strategies (ie, providing 
access to educational materials only). Active edu -
cation strategies include one-on-one education on the bio -
psychosocial contributors to pain and self-management 
techniques, such as remaining active, pacing strategies, and 
back-protection techniques. Physical therapists may also in -
corporate counseling on the favorable natural history of 
acute LBP as part of the education strategy.
EDUCATION FOR PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC LBP
Education and Advice
IIOne clinical trial (n = 90) by Akca et al2 showed 
moderate benefit for pain intensity of postrehabili -
tation group education sessions that included anat -
omy and function of the spine, how back pain develops, 
proper body movements, the most commonly made mistakes 
in everyday life, correct postures at work and rest, and 
back-protection techniques, compared to no treatment. 
Mean pain scores for patients in the education group de -
creased at 3-month follow-up and showed significant im -
provement over the control group, favoring education.
IIDu Bois and Donceel48 performed a large RCT (n = 
509) that found no difference in the average num -
ber of days on sick leave for the index episode of

Acute and Chronic Low Back Pain: Clinical Practice GuidelinesAcute and Chronic Low Back Pain: Clinical Practice GuidelinesLBP across participants managed with rehabilitation-orient -
ed information and advice or with usual care. The proportion 
of claimants with 1 or more recurrences of sick leave for LBP 
was significantly higher in the control group. During the total 
follow-up period, the mean number of days on full benefits 
because of back pain was higher in the control group com -
pared to the intervention group.
IIAnother RCT132 (n = 126) found no additional ben -
efit of education using “The Back Book” pamphlet 
over a natural history control group for outcomes 
related to physical impairment, pain intensity, health-related 
quality of life, and accumulated sickness absence days in an 
occupational cohort with nonacute LBP.
IIAn RCT150 (n = 62) found no additional benefit for 
pain intensity or disability with administration of 
“The Back Book” versus no intervention at a fol -
low-up time of approximately 3 weeks.
IIOne RCT134 (n = 181) found no additional benefit 
of a face-to-face review of “The Back Book” com -
pared to a control group that only received “The 
Back Book” (without a face-to-face review) for pain intensi -
ty or disability at any time point during the 24-month 
follow-up.
IIAn RCT152 (n = 219) of female health care workers 
with recurrent LBP found a moderate benefit of 
combined neuromuscular exercise and back care 
counseling compared to either intervention alone and to a 
nontreatment control group for measures of pain intensity 
(effect size = 0.7). The counseling-only intervention showed 
no additional benefit over the control group.
Evidence Update
In the updated search, 6 RCTs evaluated the use of general 
education or advice as a stand-alone treatment for patients 
with chronic LBP. Four RCTs compared education to no 
treatment or usual care, while the other 2 RCTs compared the 
use of an education booklet (“The Back Book”) to no treat -
ment. The majority of the RCTs that used general education 
or advice as a stand-alone treatment found no additional 
benefit for pain and disability. Studies that included exercise 
showed improvements in pain and disability when combined 
with education.
2021 Recommendation
BPhysical therapists may use standard education 
strategies for patients with chronic LBP, but not as 
a stand-alone treatment. Standard education strat -
egies include advice related to exercise and advice about stay -
ing active.Pain Neuroscience Education
IAn RCT91 (n = 104) studying adults with chronic 
pain found small or moderate short-term benefits 
of pain psychology and neuroscience education 
compared to a health behavior education program for pain 
severity and pain interference at 1-month follow-up.
IA systematic review and meta-analysis168 reported 
that the use of pain neuroscience education (PNE) 
resulted in small additional benefits over no PNE for 
short-term pain (weighted mean difference, 0.73) and that 
benefits were slightly higher (weighted mean difference, 1.32) 
when used alongside physical therapy interventions. Likewise, 
meta-analysis for short ‐term disability demonstrated a weight -
ed mean difference of 0.42, favoring PNE compared to no 
PNE, whereas the addition of PNE to physical therapy inter -
ventions demonstrated larger benefits (weighted mean differ -
ence, 3.94). Study heterogeneity precluded definitive 
assessments of long-term (12-month) outcomes. Another sys -
tematic review,102 which included some of the same studies as 
the aforementioned meta-analysis, reported similar findings. 
Notably, none of the included studies that used PNE alone 
found improvements in pain, whereas 5 of the 6 studies that 
combined PNE with another intervention like exercise or 
manual therapy found significant reductions in pain.
IIAn RCT23 (n = 56) in patients with chronic LBP 
found a moderate or large short-term benefit of 
PNE combined with multimodal therapeutic exer -
cise compared to therapeutic exercise alone for pain intensity 
and disability at 3 months.
IIAn RCT139 (n = 36) compared 4-week outcomes of 
PNE plus manual therapy to traditional patient ed -
ucation plus manual therapy. Pain neuroscience 
education plus manual therapy demonstrated moderate or 
large short-term benefits for changes in pain severity and the 
physical functioning subscale of the Medical Outcomes Study 
36-Item Short-Form Health Survey.
Evidence Update
There were 2 systematic reviews (1 with a meta-analysis) 
and 3 RCTs that met the criteria for inclusion. The included 
evidence supports the use of PNE as an education strategy 
for chronic LBP. However, pain and disability improvements 
were mostly associated with small effect sizes and greatest 
when PNE was combined with exercise or manual therapy 
interventions.
2021 Recommendation
APhysical therapists should deliver PNE alongside oth -
er physical therapy interventions, such as exercise 
or manual therapy, to patients with chronic LBP.

Acute and Chronic Low Back Pain: Clinical Practice GuidelinesAcute and Chronic Low Back Pain: Clinical Practice GuidelinesEducation Compared to Other Active Treatments
IAn RCT (n = 701) by Lamb et al97 found small ben -
efits of a group cognitive behavioral intervention 
compared to a brief session of best-practice advice 
to remain active supplemented by “The Back Book” for mea -
sures of disability at 3, 6, and 12 months. There was no ben -
efit of the cognitive behavioral intervention over education 
for pain intensity.
IAn RCT112 (n = 86) of adults with chronic LBP 
found small to moderate benefits of Pilates com -
pared to an educational booklet containing infor -
mation about the anatomy of the spine and LBP and 
recommendations regarding posture and movements in -
volved in activities of daily living. Improvements in pain in -
tensity and disability favored the Pilates group following a 
6-week intervention, but benefits were no longer significantly 
different by 6-month follow-up.
IAn RCT138 (n = 320) of predominantly low-income, 
racially diverse adults with chronic LBP found no 
additional benefit of yoga or physical therapy com -
pared to education using “The Back Pain Helpbook” for dis -
ability at 12 weeks. Yoga was not better than education for 
pain intensity, but physical therapy demonstrated a small 
benefit over education alone.
ISherman et al148 performed an RCT (n = 229) 
comparing yoga, stretching, and the use of “The 
Back Pain Helpbook” among adults with chronic 
LBP. Yoga demonstrated small benefits over the education 
self-care group for function and symptoms. At 26 weeks, 
function for the yoga group remained superior. Signifi -
cantly more participants in the yoga and stretching groups 
had clinically meaningful improvements in symptoms and 
disability compared with the education self-care group at 
12 weeks.
IAn RCT161 (n = 54) found moderate benefits of Pi -
lates training compared to education using a pam -
phlet that had information on posture, physical 
activity, and exercise. Between-group mean differences in 
disability score changes were 3.2 ± 4.1 on the RMDQ and 12.3 
± 18.5 on the ODI, and the current pain VAS score change 
was 1.4 ± 2.3.
IIAn RCT26 (n = 159) of adults with chronic LBP com -
paring the combination of Kundalini yoga and 
strength training to self-care advice using “The 
Back Book” alone found moderate benefit of exercise com -
pared to use of “The Back Book” alone for change in back 
pain intensity (using the Chronic Pain Grade Scale) at 
6-month follow-up. No benefits were found for disability for yoga and strength training over the educational approach 
alone.
IIAn RCT62 (n = 75) of adults with chronic LBP re -
ported moderate-to-large benefits of a patient-led 
goal-setting intervention compared to advice to 
exercise for improving outcomes in disability and pain inten -
sity. Group differences in improvement were greater in the 
intervention group at posttreatment and 4 and 12 months, 
with moderate-to-high effect sizes.
Evidence Update
Many RCTs evaluated patient education as a control inter -
vention, often by using “The Back Book.” There were 7 RCTs 
that compared patient education to physically active inter -
ventions, including yoga, stretching, Pilates, and strength 
training.26,62,97,112,138,148,161 Results largely supported small or 
moderate benefits of the active treatment over educational 
interventions, with the size of the effect depending on the 
study end point.
2021 Recommendation
APhysical therapists should use active treatments 
(eg, yoga, stretching, Pilates, and strength training) 
instead of stand-alone educational interventions 
for patients with chronic LBP.
EDUCATION FOR POSTOPERATIVE LBP
General Education
IAn RCT11 (n = 86) of patients undergoing laminec -
tomy found moderate to large benefits of a targeted 
cognitive behavioral therapy–based rehabilitation 
approach compared to a general postoperative education 
program for back and leg pain intensity, disability, and pain 
interference at 3 months after surgery, but not immediately 
posttreatment.
IIAn RCT136 (n = 96) of patients undergoing lumbar 
fusion found no additional benefit of a preoperative 
cognitive behavioral intervention compared to 
standard preoperative education for pain or disability 1 year 
following surgery. However, the reduction in disability was 
achieved much faster in the cognitive behavioral intervention 
group.
IIAn RCT (n = 129) by Claus et al32 of adults under -
going first-time discectomy found no additional 
benefit of education using a biopsychosocial evi -
dence-based booklet compared to a biomedical-based book -
let for pain intensity or disability outcomes 2 months 
following surgery.

Acute and Chronic Low Back Pain: Clinical Practice GuidelinesAcute and Chronic Low Back Pain: Clinical Practice GuidelinesIIOne RCT (n = 338)110 found no significant differ -
ences in pain or disability outcomes over 12 months 
among patients receiving education using the “Your 
Back Operation” booklet, education plus rehabilitation, reha -
bilitation alone, or usual care following discectomy or lateral 
nerve root decompression surgery. The educational content 
of the booklet aimed to reduce uncertainty around surgery, 
promote positive beliefs, encourage early reactivation, and 
provide practical advice on self-management.
Evidence Update
Collectively, these findings suggest that education may con -
fer similar benefits to those of cognitive behavioral therapy–
focused treatment when delivered in the preoperative time 
frame, but not when delivered in the postoperative period. 
Given the difference in treatment parameters, content, and 
surgical populations among these studies, no formal rec -
ommendations related to education are made regarding the 
comparative benefits of active treatment versus patient edu -
cation in the preoperative or postoperative period.
2021 Recommendation
BPhysical therapists may use general education (eg, 
postsurgical precautions, exercise, and resuming 
physical activity) for patients with LBP following lumbar spine surgery. This recommendation applies to those 
undergoing discectomy or decompression surgery. No specif -
ic recommendation is provided for education for patients 
undergoing other surgical procedures (eg, spinal fusion) due 
to lack of evidence.
KEY POINTS FOR PATIENT EDUCATION
Acute LBP
• Active patient education strategies, including information 
on biopsychosocial contributors to pain and self-manage -
ment techniques, have evidence that they reduce pain and 
disability in patients with acute LBP.
Chronic LBP
• Patient education should not be used as a stand-alone 
treatment to reduce pain and disability in patients with 
chronic LBP, but can be combined with other interventions 
such as exercise and manual therapy.
Postoperative LBP
• Patient education has primarily been studied post lumbar 
decompression or discectomy surgery.
• No evidence supports education for patients undergoing 
other surgical procedures (eg, spinal fusion).

Acute and Chronic Low Back Pain: Clinical Practice GuidelinesAcute and Chronic Low Back Pain: Clinical Practice GuidelinesARTICLE INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR ARTICLE SCREENING/FULL- TEXT REVIEW
Patient/Subject Characteristics
Include:
• Studies using data from humans
• Subjects over 18 years of age
• Subjects with low back pain, defined with search terms as “nonspecific low back pain,” “mechanical low back pain,” “lumbosacral 
segmental/ spinal instability” (including spondylolisthesis), “lumbosacral somatic dysfunction,” “lumbosacral sprain,” “lumbosacral 
strain flatback syndrome,” “intervertebral disc degeneration” and/ or “herniation,” “lumbar radiculopathy,” or “sciatica”
Exclude:
• Studies of patients with a condition outside the diagnosis of musculoskeletal low back pain (eg, tumor, fracture, kidney dysfunction, 
ankylosing spondylitis)
Article Characteristics
Include:
• English
• Published from December 1, 2010 to present
• Articles reporting analysis of data: systematic reviews, meta-analyses, randomized clinical trials
• Articles reporting patient-centered outcomes, including disability, pain, physical function, ability to work or participate in social activi -
ties, etc
Exclude:
• Study protocols
• Observational, experimental, and quasi-experimental cohort studies
• Cross-sectional studies
• Case reports
• Case series
• Conference abstracts, press releases, newsletters, editorial letters, commentaries, opinions
• Articles published in non–peer-reviewed publications (eg, theses)
T opics Included
Intervention: Diagnosis/Classification
Include:
Articles that analyze data on classification of people with low back pain to inform physical therapy treatment. This may include treat -
ment-based classification systems, acuity-based systems, prognostic risk stratification approaches, and the current CPG’s ICF-based 
classification system (low back pain with mobility deficits, low back pain with movement coordination impairments, low back pain with 
related lower extremity pain, low back pain with radiating pain, low back pain with related generalized pain, and low back pain with re -
lated cognitive or affective tendencies).
Intervention: Manual Therapy
Include:
Skilled hand movements and skilled passive movements of joints and soft tissue (thrust and nonthrust) within the scope of physical 
therapy practice. Manual therapy techniques may include the following:
• T raction: an intervention that uses manually or mechanically applied forces with the intention of stretching and distracting the spine
• Massage
- Connective tissue massage
- Therapeutic massage
• Mobilization/ manipulation
- Soft tissue
- Spinal and peripheral joints
• Dry needling: an intervention that uses a thin filiform needle to penetrate the skin and stimulate underlying myofascial trigger points 
and muscular and connective tissues for the management of neuromusculoskeletal pain and movement impairments. Dry needling 
is a technique used to treat dysfunctions in skeletal muscle, fascia, and connective tissue, and to diminish persistent peripheral noci -
ceptive input and reduce or restore impairments of body structure and function, leading to improved activity and participationAPPENDIX D

Acute and Chronic Low Back Pain: Clinical Practice GuidelinesAcute and Chronic Low Back Pain: Clinical Practice Guidelines• Neural tissue mobilization: manual therapy techniques intended to enhance the dynamic balance between the relative movement of 
neural tissues and surrounding mechanical interfaces, thereby allowing reduced intrinsic pressures on the neural tissue and thus pro -
moting optimum physiologic function
Exclude:
• Articles using “acupuncture”
• Articles on direct traction using pins or wires inserted through bone
• Articles that report on soft tissue mobilization and stretching without targeting nerve mobility
Intervention: Exercise
Include:
Therapeutic exercise may include the following within the scope of physical therapy practice:
• Aerobic capacity/ endurance conditioning or reconditioning
- Aquatic programs
- Increased workload over time
- Movement efficiency and energy conservation training
- Walking and wheelchair propulsion programs
• Flexibility exercises
- Muscle lengthening
- Range of motion
- Stretching
• Strength, power, and endurance training for head, neck, limb, pelvic floor, trunk, and ventilatory muscles
- Active assistive, active, and resistive exercises (including concentric, dynamic/isotonic, eccentric, isokinetic, isometric, and 
plyometric)
- Aquatic programs
- Standardized, programmatic, or complementary exercise approaches (eg, yoga, Pilates, etc)
- T ask-specific performance training
Centralization and Directional Preference Exercises
Include:
• Repeated movements
- Centralization
- Directional preference
- McKenzie therapy
- Flexion-based exercise
- Extension-based exercise
Exclude:
• Articles on complementary movement therapy approaches such as yoga, Pilates, or tai chi if these interventions are delivered by oth -
er health care providers
Intervention: Patient Education and Counseling
Include:
Education and counseling interventions specifically directed toward the management of low back pain that include counseling or patient 
education as the sole intervention studied. Examples of accepted education or counseling approaches are:
• Pathology or health condition
• Performance enhancement
• Psychosocial influences on treatment (eg, fear-avoidance beliefs, behavior change techniques)
• Risk factors for pathology or health condition, impairments in body function and structure, activity limitations, and participation 
restrictions
• Delivery of psychologically informed physical therapy
Exclude:
• Education or counseling outside the scope of physical therapy practice and/ or delivered by other health care providers
• Education or counseling that was not specific to management of low back pain and instead was directed toward general health  
practices (eg, nutrition, weight loss)
