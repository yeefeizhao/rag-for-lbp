Somatic symptom and related disorders is the name for a group of conditions in which the physical pain and symptoms a person feels are related to psychological factors. Such pain and symptoms result in excessive thoughts, feelings and behaviors and can interfere with a person’s ability to function and maintain relationships. These symptoms can’t be traced to a specific physical cause. In people who have a somatic symptom and related disorders, medical test results are either normal or don’t explain the person’s symptoms.
People who have this disorder may have several medical evaluations and tests to be sure that they don’t have another illness. They often become very worried about their health because they don’t know what’s causing their health problems. Their symptoms are similar to the symptoms of other illnesses and may last for several years. People who have a somatoform disorder are not faking their symptoms. The pain that they feel is real.

Sexual symptoms (such as pain during sexual activity, loss of sexual desire, and extremely painful periods in women)
Hypochondriasis
occurs when a person believes that normal body functions (such as a grumbling stomach) or minor symptoms (such as a common headache) are symptoms of a very serious disorder. To a person who has hypochondriasis, a grumbling stomach may mean stomach cancer. A headache may mean a brain tumor.
Body dysmorphic disorder

What causes somatic symptom and related disorders?
No one knows exactly why symptoms of somatic symptom and related disorders appear. In some cases, there may be a problem with the nerve impulses that send signals of pain, pressure, and other unpleasant sensations to the brain.

Like many medical problems, somatic symptom and related disorders often run in families. They also tend to come and go over time.
How is somatic symptom and related disorders diagnosed?
Somatic symptom and related disorders can be difficult to diagnose. Your doctor will do a physical exam and possibly order tests. If tests show that you aren’t sick, your doctor may refer you to a mental health provider. In general, your doctor will evaluate whether you are experiencing:
One or more physical symptoms that are concerning or cause disruption in daily life
Excessive thoughts, feelings or behaviors tied to the physical symptoms or health concerns with at least one of the following:
Ongoing thoughts that are larger than the seriousness of symptoms
Ongoing anxiety about health or symptoms
Excessive time and energy spent on the symptoms or health concerns
At least one symptom that is constantly present, although there may be different symptoms and symptoms may come and go
People with somatic symptom disorder typically see their primary care physician rather than seek counseling or mental health care. This may be due to the fact that people experiencing this disorder can’t accept a mental health diagnosis. They may continue to be fearful and worried even when they are shown evidence that they do not have a serious condition. Some people have only pain as their dominant symptom. Somatic symptom disorder usually begins by age 30.
