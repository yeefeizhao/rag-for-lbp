How this helps:
It lengthens your spine, which improves posture, and increases comfort, mobility and range of motion. Many of us have a forward head posture. We get this from the type of recreation and work activities we do every day. This posture changes our patterns of movement and our breathing efficiency.
How to do it:
Look straight forward.  Tuck your chin to align your ears over your shoulders. This will create a double chin if performed correctly. Hold this position for 10 seconds.
Relax and return to the starting position. Repeat 5 to 10 times.
