 Diagnosis &amp; Treatment of Low Back Pain | PrefaceRecommendations were developed based on a specific definition, inclusion/exclusion criteria, and the resulting literature which excluded conditions 
such as presence of a neurological deficit or leg pain experienced below the knee, among others. Given the exclusion criteria, these guideline rec-
ommendations address a subset of low back pain care as opposed to low back pain in its entirety. This clinical guideline is not intended to be a fixed 
treatment protocol; it is anticipated that there will be patients who require more or less treatment than what is outlined. This clinical guideline should 
not be construed as including all proper methods of care or excluding other acceptable methods of care reasonably directed to obtaining the same 
results. The ultimate judgment regarding any specific procedure or treatment is to be made by the physician and patient in light of all circumstances 
presented by the patient and the needs and resources particular to the locality or institution.2

Improvement/Clinical-Guidelines. Diagnosis &amp; Treatment of Low Back Pain | Introduction6
Recommendations were developed based on a specific definition, inclusion/exclusion criteria, and the resulting literature which excluded conditions 
such as presence of a neurological deficit or leg pain experienced below the knee, among others. Given the exclusion criteria, these guideline rec-
ommendations address a subset of low back pain care as opposed to low back pain in its entirety. This clinical guideline is not intended to be a fixed 
treatment protocol; it is anticipated that there will be patients who require more or less treatment than what is outlined. This clinical guideline should 
not be construed as including all proper methods of care or excluding other acceptable methods of care reasonably directed to obtaining the same 
results. The ultimate judgment regarding any specific procedure or treatment is to be made by the physician and patient in light of all circumstances 
presented by the patient and the needs and resources particular to the locality or institution.Objective 
The objective of the North American Spine Society 
(NASS) Clinical Guideline for the Diagnosis and Treat-
ment of Low Back Pain is to provide evidence-based 
recommendations to address key clinical questions 
surrounding the diagnosis and treatment of adult 
patients with nonspecific low back pain. This guide-
line is based upon a systematic review of the evidence 
and reflects contemporary treatment concepts for 
low back pain as reflected in the highest quality clin-
ical literature available on this subject as of February 
2016. The goals of the guideline recommendations are 
to assist in delivering optimum, efficacious treatment 
and functional recovery from nonspecific low back 
pain. 
Scope, Purpose and Intended User 
This document was developed by the North American 
Spine Society Evidence-Based Guideline Development 
Committee with representation from stakeholder or-
ganizations as an educational tool to assist practi-
tioners who treat adult patients with nonspecific low 
back pain. The goal is to provide a tool that assists 
practitioners in improving the quality and efficiency 
of care delivered to these patients. The NASS Clinical 
Guideline for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Low Back 
Pain outlines a reasonable evaluation of patients with 
nonspecific low back pain and outlines treatment op-
tions for adult patients with this condition. 
THIS GUIDELINE DOES NOT REPRESENT A 
“STANDARD OF CARE,” nor is it intended as a fixed 
treatment protocol. It is anticipated that there will be 
patients who will require less or more treatment than 
the average. It is also acknowledged that in atypical 
cases, treatment falling outside this guideline will 
sometimes be necessary. This guideline should not 
be seen as prescribing the type, frequency or duration 
of intervention. Treatment should be based on the 
individual patient’s need and doctor’s professional 
judgment and experience. This document is designed 
to function as a guideline and should not be used as 
the sole reason for denial of treatment and services. 
This guideline is not intended to expand or restrict a 
health care provider’s scope of practice or to supersede 
applicable ethical standards or provisions of law. Patient Population 
The patient population for this guideline encompass-
es adults (18 years or older) with low back pain defined 
as pain of musculoskeletal origin extending from the 
lowest rib to the gluteal fold that may at times extend 
as somatic referred pain into the thigh (above the 
knee).
Considerations:	 Why	This	Guideline	Is	Different	
and	How 	Exclusion	of 	Leg	Pain	Impacts	the	
Recommendations
NASS typically writes clinical guidelines based on di-
agnosis. Due to demand and the expertise of NASS 
spine care specialists, NASS, in this single instance, 
has opted to address low back pain as a generalized 
topic rather than a specific diagnosis or code. As a 
multidisciplinary organization for spine care provid-
ers, NASS was uniquely positioned to provide specialty 
expertise and a real-world perspective on multidisci-
plinary spine care. It is important to keep in mind that 
“low back pain” is no more a diagnosis in the spine 
field than “chest pain” is for cardiology, but rather a 
generalized patient complaint that can encompass a 
variety of diagnoses. 
Recommendations were developed based on a specific 
definition, inclusion/exclusion criteria, and the re-
sulting literature which excluded leg pain below the 
knee. Leg pain was excluded in order to address treat-
ment of  nonspecific low back pain. For many sections, 
the inclusion of leg pain in the literature search would 
have included many specific causes of back pain, in-
cluding disc herniation and spondylolisthesis, that 
would have made the focus on nonspecific low back 
pain more difficult and less clear.
Without the inclusion of leg pain, these guideline rec-
ommendations address only a subset of low back pain 
and its care. The inclusion and exclusion criteria used 
resulted in the removal of multiple articles that may 
have influenced overall recommendations for a par-
ticular treatment or procedure. Evaluation of a par-
ticular treatment or procedure under different clinical 
circumstances would necessitate a separate evalua-
tion of the evidence. Diagnosis &amp; Treatment of Low Back Pain | Introduction7
Recommendations were developed based on a specific definition, inclusion/exclusion criteria, and the resulting literature which excluded conditions 
such as presence of a neurological deficit or leg pain experienced below the knee, among others. Given the exclusion criteria, these guideline rec-
ommendations address a subset of low back pain care as opposed to low back pain in its entirety. This clinical guideline is not intended to be a fixed 
treatment protocol; it is anticipated that there will be patients who require more or less treatment than what is outlined. This clinical guideline should 
not be construed as including all proper methods of care or excluding other acceptable methods of care reasonably directed to obtaining the same 
results. The ultimate judgment regarding any specific procedure or treatment is to be made by the physician and patient in light of all circumstances 
presented by the patient and the needs and resources particular to the locality or institution.Due to the time needed to develop a guideline of this 
size and breadth, some explanation is needed as to the 
why or why not certain items can be found in the con-
tent.
 Although opioids are addressed, it is in a limited 
fashion. The opioid crisis as we know it today was 
a phenomenon that reached crisis proportions af-
ter the guideline was already in development. In 
the future, more substantial attention to this is-
sue will be merited.
 This is the largest clinical guideline NASS has 
ever undertaken and four years in the making. 
There were 82 clinical questions and the literature 
search resulted in more than 45,000 articles. Due to the high volume of literature and the labor-
intensive nature of the review, literature search 
dates are spread out in some instances (although 
most were within the same month). In addition, 
consideration should be given to the fact that 
newer research has been published since the 
literature searches have taken place.
 This document is based on the evidence known at 
the time of the literature review. However, evi-
dence can be incomplete or immature and recom-
mendations can change in the future where the 
current evidence is thin, weak, or evolving. NASS’ 
future recommendations for research are a valu-
able tool when considering these areas.  Recommendations were developed based on a specific definition, inclusion/exclusion criteria, and the resulting literature which excluded conditions 
such as presence of a neurological deficit or leg pain experienced below the knee, among others. Given the exclusion criteria, these guideline rec-
ommendations address a subset of low back pain care as opposed to low back pain in its entirety. This clinical guideline is not intended to be a fixed 
treatment protocol; it is anticipated that there will be patients who require more or less treatment than what is outlined. This clinical guideline should 
not be construed as including all proper methods of care or excluding other acceptable methods of care reasonably directed to obtaining the same 
results. The ultimate judgment regarding any specific procedure or treatment is to be made by the physician and patient in light of all circumstances 
presented by the patient and the needs and resources particular to the locality or institution.
Diagnosis &amp; Treatment of Low Back Pain | Development Methodology and Process8
Guideline Development 
Methodology
Through objective evaluation of the evidence 
and transparency in the process of making 
recommendations, it is NASS’ goal to develop 
evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for the 
diagnosis and treatment of adult patients with various 
spinal conditions. These guidelines are developed for 
educational purposes to assist practitioners in their 
clinical decision-making processes. 
Multidisciplinary and Multi-Stakeholder 
Collaboration 
With the goal of ensuring the best possible care for 
adult patients suffering with spinal disorders, NASS 
is committed to multidisciplinary involvement in the 
process of guideline development. To this end, NASS 
has ensured that representatives from research, both 
operative and non-operative, medical, interventional 
and surgical spine specialties have participated in the 
development and review of NASS guidelines. To en-
sure broad-based representation on this topic, NASS 
invited representatives from organizations whose 
members are involved in the care of patients with low 
back pain to serve on guideline work groups. A more 
detailed description of stakeholder involvement is 
included under the “Guideline Development Process” 
on page 9. 
Evidence Analysis Training of all Guideline 
Developers 
As a condition of participation, all developers com-
pleted NASS’ Fundamentals of Evidence-Based Med-
icine Training prior to participating in guideline de-
velopment. The training includes a series of readings 
and exercises to prepare guideline developers for 
systematically evaluating literature and developing 
evidence-based guidelines. Participants are awarded 
CME credit upon completion of the course. 
Disclosure	of 	Potential 	Conflicts	of 	Interest	
All participants involved in guideline development 
have disclosed potential conflicts of interest to their 
colleagues in accordance with NASS’ Disclosure Pol-
icy (https://www.spine.org/DisclosurePolicy) and 
their potential conflicts have been documented in the 
Technical Report associated with this guideline. NASS 
does not restrict involvement in guidelines based on 
conflicts as long as members provide full disclosure. 
Individuals with a conflict relevant to the subject 
matter were asked to recuse themselves from delib-eration. Participants have been asked to update their 
disclosures regularly throughout the guideline devel-
opment process. 
Levels of Evidence and Grades of 
Recommendation 
NASS has adopted standardized levels of evidence 
(Appendix A) and grades of recommendation (Appen-
dix B) to assist practitioners in easily understanding 
the strength of the evidence and recommendations 
within the guidelines. The levels of evidence range 
from Level I (high quality randomized controlled tri-
al) to Level V (expert consensus). Grades of recom-
mendation indicate the strength of the recommenda-
tions made in the guideline based on the quality of the 
literature. 
Grades of Recommendation: 
 A: Good evidence (Level I studies with consistent 
findings) for or against recommending interven-
tion.
 B: Fair evidence (Level II or III studies with con-
sistent findings) for or against recommending 
intervention. 
 C: Poor quality evidence (Level IV or V studies) for 
or against recommending intervention. 
 I: Insufficient or conflicting evidence not allowing 
a recommendation for or against intervention.
Levels of evidence have very specific criteria and are 
assigned to studies prior to developing recommenda-
tions. Recommendations are then graded based upon 
the level of evidence. To better understand how levels 
of evidence inform the grades of recommendation and 
the standard nomenclature used within the recom-
mendations see Appendix C. 
Guideline recommendations are written utilizing a 
standard language that indicates the strength of the 
recommendation. “A” recommendations indicate a 
test or intervention is “recommended”; “B” recom-
mendations “suggest” a test or intervention and “C” 
recommendations indicate a test or intervention “may 
be considered” or “is an option.” “I” or “Insufficient 
Evidence” statements clearly indicate that “there is 
insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for 
or against” a test or intervention. Work group con-
sensus statements clearly state that “in the absence of 
reliable evidence, it is the work group’s opinion that” 
a test or intervention may be appropriate.  Recommendations were developed based on a specific definition, inclusion/exclusion criteria, and the resulting literature which excluded conditions 
such as presence of a neurological deficit or leg pain experienced below the knee, among others. Given the exclusion criteria, these guideline rec-
ommendations address a subset of low back pain care as opposed to low back pain in its entirety. This clinical guideline is not intended to be a fixed 
treatment protocol; it is anticipated that there will be patients who require more or less treatment than what is outlined. This clinical guideline should 
not be construed as including all proper methods of care or excluding other acceptable methods of care reasonably directed to obtaining the same 
results. The ultimate judgment regarding any specific procedure or treatment is to be made by the physician and patient in light of all circumstances 
presented by the patient and the needs and resources particular to the locality or institution.
Diagnosis &amp; Treatment of Low Back Pain | Development Methodology and Process9
In evaluating studies as to levels of evidence for this 
guideline, the study design was interpreted as estab-
lishing only a potential level of evidence. As an ex-
ample, a therapeutic study designed as a randomized 
controlled trial would be considered a potential Level 
I study. The study would then be further analyzed as 
to how well the study design was implemented and 
significant shortcomings in the execution of the study 
would be used to downgrade the levels of evidence for 
the study’s conclusions. In the example cited previ-
ously, reasons to downgrade the results of a potential 
Level I randomized controlled trial to a Level II study 
II would include, among other possibilities: an un-
derpowered study (patient sample too small, variance 
too high), inadequate randomization or masking of 
the group assignments and lack of validated outcome 
measures. 
In addition, a number of studies were reviewed sev-
eral times in answering different questions within 
this guideline. How a given question was asked might 
influence how a study was evaluated and interpreted 
as to its level of evidence in answering that particular 
question. For example, a randomized controlled trial 
reviewed to evaluate the differences between the out-
comes of surgically treated versus untreated patients 
with lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy might 
be a well-designed and implemented Level I ther-
apeutic study. This same study, however, might be 
classified as providing Level II prognostic evidence if 
the data for the untreated controls were extracted and 
evaluated prognostically. 
Guideline Development Process 
Step 1: Recruitment of Guideline Members and 
Involvement of Stakeholder Representatives
NASS Evidence-Based Guideline Development Com-
mittee members were solicited to participate in the 
guideline development process. NASS also invited 
stakeholder organizations who participate in the Spine 
Summit, a multi-stakeholder meeting convened to 
discuss and collaborate on projects that advance the 
field of spine care, to nominate representatives from 
their respective organization to serve on the guideline 
panel. Additional specialties not represented at the 
Spine Summit were also solicited to participate in the 
guideline to ensure broad representation of all spe-
cialties directly involved in the care of patients with 
low back pain. In total, 62 volunteers participated in 
this effort, including 11 stakeholder societies. Names 
of guideline panelists are listed on page 2 and dis-
closures are listed in the Technical Report associated with this document.  The stakeholder groups can also 
be found on page 3. 
NASS spearheaded this guideline effort by providing 
staff support and financial support, including liter-
ature searches, full text articles, webinar/conference 
capabilities and food and beverage and facility fees 
for the in-person recommendation meetings. Stake-
holder organizations were asked to cover travel and 
accommodation related expenses for their represen-
tative to attend any in-person meetings.  
Step 2: Identification of Work Groups 
The guideline panel consists of seven sections: Diag-
nosis, Imaging, Medical and Psychological Treatment, 
Interventional Treatment, Physical Medicine and Re-
habilitation, Surgical Treatment and Cost-Utility.  
Stakeholder societies were asked to rank their interest 
in participating in each section and their representa-
tive was placed in their first or second choice. Senior 
and newer NASS Evidence-Based Guideline Develop-
ment members were equally placed in work groups to 
ensure that groups with newer members were bal-
anced with members who have more guideline de-
velopment experience. Each work group consisted 
of 7 to 11 members representing multi-disciplinary 
backgrounds. The guideline panel includes represen-
tation from the fields of primary care, psychology, 
neurosurgery, orthopedic surgery, physical medicine 
and rehabilitation, physiatry, chiropractic care, phys-
ical therapy, anesthesiology, research, and radiology. 
NASS believes that having multidisciplinary teams 
involved in the guideline development process helps 
to minimize inadvertent biases in evaluating the lit-
erature and formulating recommendations. 
Step 3: Surveying Patients 
To seek patient input to help inform the development 
of clinical questions, NASS circulated an informal 
Survey Monkey poll to better understand patients’  
experiences with low back pain treatment. The sur-
vey link was circulated through various websites and 
social media sites, including NASS’ Facebook and 
Twitter pages; spine-health.com’s website, Face-
book group and blog; Low-Back Pain Patient Support 
Group on Facebook; Lower Back Pain Management 
Support Group on Facebook; and numerous Facebook 
shares (of the survey link) on consumer and physician 
profiles. A total of 415 people opened the survey link, 
including 413 who consented to participate in the sur-
vey and 2 who did not participate. The survey included 
the following questions that allowed for check the box 
and open-ended responses: Recommendations were developed based on a specific definition, inclusion/exclusion criteria, and the resulting literature which excluded conditions 
such as presence of a neurological deficit or leg pain experienced below the knee, among others. Given the exclusion criteria, these guideline rec-
ommendations address a subset of low back pain care as opposed to low back pain in its entirety. This clinical guideline is not intended to be a fixed 
treatment protocol; it is anticipated that there will be patients who require more or less treatment than what is outlined. This clinical guideline should 
not be construed as including all proper methods of care or excluding other acceptable methods of care reasonably directed to obtaining the same 
results. The ultimate judgment regarding any specific procedure or treatment is to be made by the physician and patient in light of all circumstances 
presented by the patient and the needs and resources particular to the locality or institution.
Diagnosis &amp; Treatment of Low Back Pain | Development Methodology and Process10
1. What symptoms made you seek medical attention 
for your current and/or any past episodes of low-
back pain?
2. Please identify the treatment(s) you received for 
your current and/or any past episodes of low back 
pain. 
3. Based on your treatment experiences for your 
current and any previous episodes of low back 
pain, is there anything that you wish your health-
care provider shared with you before making your 
decision to receive treatment? 
4. What questions do you recommend that other pa-
tients with low back pain ask their providers when 
seeking a diagnosis and treatment options for low 
back pain?
Step 4: Identification of Clinical Questions 
Framing questions to ask in the guideline is critical to 
the guideline development process. Guideline partici-
pants were asked to submit a list of clinical questions 
pertaining to their assigned section with the patient 
survey as reference. Members were asked to use the 
acronym “PICO” when drafting questions. “PICO” 
serves to guide the development of clinical questions 
that include all of the necessary components to build a 
literature search: “P” for the patient/problem; “I” for 
the intervention or indicator of interest (procedures, 
therapies, diagnostic tests, exposure, etc.); “C” for 
comparison and “O” for outcome of interest. The pro-
posed questions were compiled into a master list and 
circulated to each member for review and comment. 
Step 5: External Review of Clinical Question 
Protocol
The draft list of clinical questions was made public-
ly available on the NASS website for a 4-week public 
comment period from June 16, 2015 to July 14, 2015. 
Additionally, stakeholders were invited through email 
solicitations to comment on the draft questions. In 
response, 27 individuals and organizations submit-
ted comment letters. Based on feedback, several re-
visions were incorporated in the guideline definition 
and clinical question list. After the comment period, 
an updated clinical question list with summarized 
changes was posted to the NASS website and circulat-
ed to all public comment period reviewers. 
Step 6: Identification of Search Terms and 
Parameters 
One of the most crucial elements of evidence analy-
sis is the comprehensive literature search. Thorough 
assessment of the literature is the basis for the re-view of existing evidence and the formulation of ev-
idence-based recommendations. In order to ensure 
a thorough literature search, NASS has instituted a 
Literature Search Protocol (Appendix D) which has 
been followed to identify literature for evaluation in 
guideline development. In keeping with the Literature 
Search Protocol, work group members have identified 
appropriate search terms and parameters to direct the 
literature search. Specific search strategies, including 
search terms, parameters and databases searched, are 
documented in the Technical Report associated with 
this document. The guideline definition and inclu-
sion/exclusion criteria are outlined on page 16. 
Step 7: Completion of the Literature Search 
Once each work group identified search terms/pa-
rameters, the literature search was implemented by 
a medical/research librarian at InfoNOW at the Uni-
versity of Minnesota, consistent with the Literature 
Search Protocol. Following these protocols ensures 
that NASS recommendations (1) are based on a thor-
ough review of relevant literature; (2) are truly based 
on a uniform, comprehensive search strategy; and (3) 
represent the current best research evidence avail-
able. NASS maintains a search history in Endnote, for 
future use or reference. 
Step 8: Review of Search Results/Identification 
of Literature to Review 
Work group members reviewed all abstracts yielded 
from the literature search and identified the litera-
ture they would review in order to address the clinical 
questions, in accordance with the Literature Search 
Protocol (Appendix D). 
Step 9: Evidence Analysis 
Members independently developed evidentiary ta-
bles summarizing study conclusions, identifying 
strengths and weaknesses and assigning levels of ev-
idence. In order to systematically control for poten-
tial biases, two or more work group members have 
reviewed each article selected and independently as-
signed levels of evidence to the literature using the 
NASS levels of evidence. Any discrepancies in scoring 
have been addressed by two or more reviewers. Final 
ratings are completed at a final meeting or web con-
ference of section workgroup members including the 
section chair and a guideline co-chair. As a final step 
in the evidence analysis process, members have iden-
tified and documented gaps in the evidence to educate 
guideline readers about where evidence is lacking and 
help guide further needed research.  Recommendations were developed based on a specific definition, inclusion/exclusion criteria, and the resulting literature which excluded conditions 
such as presence of a neurological deficit or leg pain experienced below the knee, among others. Given the exclusion criteria, these guideline rec-
ommendations address a subset of low back pain care as opposed to low back pain in its entirety. This clinical guideline is not intended to be a fixed 
treatment protocol; it is anticipated that there will be patients who require more or less treatment than what is outlined. This clinical guideline should 
not be construed as including all proper methods of care or excluding other acceptable methods of care reasonably directed to obtaining the same 
results. The ultimate judgment regarding any specific procedure or treatment is to be made by the physician and patient in light of all circumstances 
presented by the patient and the needs and resources particular to the locality or institution.
Diagnosis &amp; Treatment of Low Back Pain | Development Methodology and Process11
Step 10: Formulation of Evidence-Based 
Recommendations and Incorporation of Expert 
Consensus 
Work groups held web-conferences and face-to-face 
meetings to discuss the evidence-based answers to 
the clinical questions, the grades of recommenda-
tions and the incorporation of expert consensus. Ex-
pert consensus was incorporated only where Level 
I-IV evidence is insufficient and the work group has 
deemed that a recommendation is warranted. Trans-
parency in the incorporation of consensus is crucial 
and all consensus-based recommendations made in 
this guideline very clearly indicate that Level I-IV ev-
idence is insufficient to support a recommendation 
and that the recommendation is based only on expert 
consensus. 
Consensus Development Process 
For recommendations with a consensus grading, 
voting was conducted using a modification of the 
nominal group technique in which each work group 
member independently and anonymously ranked 
a recommendation on a scale ranging from 1 (“ex-
tremely inappropriate”) to 9 (“extremely appropri-
ate”). Consensus was obtained when at least 80% of 
work group members ranked the recommendation as 
7, 8 or 9. When the 80% threshold was not attained, 
up to three rounds of discussion and voting were held 
to resolve disagreements. If disagreements were not 
resolved after these rounds, no recommendation was 
adopted. After the recommendations were estab-
lished, work group members developed the guideline 
content, addressing the literature supporting the rec-
ommendations. 
Step 11: Internal Review of Draft Guideline 
Guideline sections were reviewed by the section work 
groups that developed them. The full guideline draft 
was submitted to the guideline co-chairs and NASS 
Research Council for review and comment. Revisions 
to recommendations were considered only when sub-
stantiated by a preponderance of appropriate level ev-
idence. 
Step 12: External Review of Draft Guideline
Stakeholder societies were invited to comment on 
the draft guideline during an external review period 
June-August 2019. Nine of 11 stakeholder societies 
provided comments. Revisions to recommendations 
were considered only when substantiated by a pre-
ponderance of appropriate level evidence. Responses 
to external comments are available in the technical report associated with this guideline. Prior to publi-
cation, external stakeholders were invited to be listed 
as participating or contributing societies.
Step 13: Submission for Board Approval 
Once any evidence-based revisions were incorporat-
ed, the drafts were prepared for NASS Board of Di-
rectors review and approval. Edits and revisions to 
recommendations and any other content were con-
sidered for incorporation only when substantiated by 
a preponderance of appropriate level evidence. 
Step 14: Submission for Publication 
Following NASS Board approval, the guidelines were 
slated for publication. No revisions were made after 
submission for publication, but comments have been 
and will be saved for the next iteration. 
Step 15: Review and Revision Process 
The guideline recommendations will be reviewed ev-
ery five years by an EBM-trained multidisciplinary 
team and revised as appropriate after review and as-
sessment of relevant literature published since the 
development of this version of the guideline or the 
guideline will be rescinded if it will not be updated. 
Use of Acronyms 
Throughout the guideline, readers will see many ac-
ronyms with which they may not be familiar. A glos-
sary of acronyms is available on page 14.  
Nomenclature	for 	Medical/Interventional 	
Treatment 
Throughout the guideline, readers will see that what 
has traditionally been referred to as “nonoperative,” 
“nonsurgical,” or “conservative” care is now referred 
to as “medical/interventional care.” The term medi-
cal/interventional is meant to encompass pharmaco-
logical treatment, physical therapy, exercise therapy, 
manipulative therapy, modalities, various types of 
external stimulators and injections. Recommendations were developed based on a specific definition, inclusion/exclusion criteria, and the resulting literature which excluded conditions 
such as presence of a neurological deficit or leg pain experienced below the knee, among others. Given the exclusion criteria, these guideline rec-
ommendations address a subset of low back pain care as opposed to low back pain in its entirety. This clinical guideline is not intended to be a fixed 
treatment protocol; it is anticipated that there will be patients who require more or less treatment than what is outlined. This clinical guideline should 
not be construed as including all proper methods of care or excluding other acceptable methods of care reasonably directed to obtaining the same 
results. The ultimate judgment regarding any specific procedure or treatment is to be made by the physician and patient in light of all circumstances 
presented by the patient and the needs and resources particular to the locality or institution.

Glossary
Acute low back pain: Within first 6 weeks of person’s 
current LBP episode.1 
Chronic low back pain: Symptoms for current LBP 
episode present for greater than 12 weeks.2
General fitness program: Exercise program not fo-
cused on specific muscle groups; by definition the goal 
is to improve the overall general fitness of the patient 
by using a combination of aerobic conditioning with 
stretching/strengthening of all major muscle groups.
Lumbar stabilization exercises: Focused on facilitat-
ing and strengthening specific muscles that directly 
or indirectly control spinal joint function, especially 
the abdominal, gluteal and spinal extensor muscle 
groups. 
Medical/interventional treatment: The term medi-
cal/interventional treatment is used in place of “non-
operative,” “conservative,” or “nonsurgical” treat-
ment. It encompasses pharmacological treatment, 
physical therapy, exercise therapy, manipulative 
therapy, modalities, various types of external stimu-
lators and injections. 
Nonspecific low back pain: Pain in which no specific 
cause or structure can be identified to account for the 
patient’s perceived symptoms.3Radiculopathy: Dysfunction of a nerve root associated 
with pain, sensory impairment, weakness, or dimin-
ished deep tendon reflexes in a nerve root distribu-
tion.4
Recurrent low back pain: Symptoms less than ½ the 
days in a year occurring in multiple episodes.5
Sciatica: Pain radiating down the leg below the knee in 
the distribution of the sciatic nerve, suggesting nerve 
root compromise due to mechanical pressure or in-
flammation. Sciatica is the most common symptom 
of lumbar radiculopathy.4

Grade of Recommendation: I  
There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against the 
use of pain localization in predicting response to a diagnostic injection.
Grade of Recommendation: I   
There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against the 
assessment of centralization or peripheralization for the prediction of discog -

that would serve as predictors for 
the recurrence of low back pain?There is insufficient evidence to indicate that body mass index (BMI) is a po -
tential predictor of a recurrence of low back pain.
Grade of Recommendation: I  
It is suggested that history of low back pain is a potential predictor of a recur -
rence of low back pain.
Grade of Recommendation: B  Recommendations were developed based on a specific definition, inclusion/exclusion criteria, and the resulting literature which excluded conditions 
such as presence of a neurological deficit or leg pain experienced below the knee, among others. Given the exclusion criteria, these guideline rec-
ommendations address a subset of low back pain care as opposed to low back pain in its entirety. This clinical guideline is not intended to be a fixed

Diagnosis &amp; Treatment of Low Back Pain | Summary of Recommendations18
Diagnosis Question 3.  In patients 
with acute low back pain, are there 
history or physical examination 
findings that would predict that 
an episode will resolve within one 
month?
Diagnosis Question 6.  What are 
the patient characteristics that 
increase or decrease the risk of 
developing chronic low back pain 
after an acute episode? 
Diagnosis Question 9.  Does a psy -
chological evaluation assist with 
identifying patients with low back 
pain who are at risk for developing 
chronic pain or disability?
The work group considered these 
questions together as the vast ma -
jority of the literature evaluating the 
conversion from acute to chronic 
pain combined various demograph -
ic, social, psychological and physical 
examination findings in predictive 
models.It is recommended that psychosocial factors and workplace factors be as -
sessed when counseling patients regarding the risk of conversion from acute 
to chronic low back pain. 
Grade of Recommendation: A  
It is recommended that psychosocial factors be used as prognostic factors 
for return to work following an episode of acute low back pain.
Grade of Recommendation: A  
It is recommended that pain severity and functional impairment be used to 
stratify risk of conversion from acute to chronic low back pain.
Grade of Recommendation: A  
It is suggested that prior episodes of low back pain be considered a prognos -
tic factor for the conversion from acute to chronic low back pain. 
Grade of Recommendation: B   
There is insufficient evidence to assess sleep quality as a prognostic variable 
to predict recovery from acute low back pain.
Grade of Recommendation: I  
There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against the 
use of smoking and/or obesity as prognostic factors for the conversion from 
acute to chronic low back pain.
Grade of Recommendation: I  
Diagnosis Question 4.  In patients 
with low back pain, what histo -
ry and/or physical examination 
findings are useful in determining 
if the cause is nonstructural in 
nature and, therefore, guide treat -
ment?  A nonstructural cause of low back pain may be considered in patients with 
diffuse low back pain and tenderness.
Grade of Recommendation: C  
There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against the 
use of fear avoidance behavior to determine the likelihood of a structural 
cause of low back pain.
Grade of Recommendation: I  
There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against the 
presence of diffuse back tenderness for the prediction of the presence of 
disc degeneration on radiographs.
Grade of Recommendation: I   Recommendations were developed based on a specific definition, inclusion/exclusion criteria, and the resulting literature which excluded conditions 
such as presence of a neurological deficit or leg pain experienced below the knee, among others. Given the exclusion criteria, these guideline rec-
ommendations address a subset of low back pain care as opposed to low back pain in its entirety. This clinical guideline is not intended to be a fixed 
treatment protocol; it is anticipated that there will be patients who require more or less treatment than what is outlined. This clinical guideline should 
not be construed as including all proper methods of care or excluding other acceptable methods of care reasonably directed to obtaining the same

Diagnosis &amp; Treatment of Low Back Pain | Summary of Recommendations19
Diagnosis Question 5.  In patients 
with low back pain, what elements 
of the patient’s history and find -
ings from the physical examination 
would suggest the need for diag -
nostic laboratory studies?There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against 
obtaining laboratory tests to assess for inflammatory disease in patients with 
sacroiliac joint pain.
Grade of Recommendation: I  
Diagnosis Question 7.  In patients 
with low back pain, are there 
specific findings on a pain diagram 
that help differentiate the struc -
ture which is causing pain?
Diagnosis Question 8. Are there 
assessment tools or question -
naires that can help identify the 
cause of acute, subacute or chron -
ic low back pain? A systematic review of the literature yielded no studies to adequately ad -
dress these questions.
Diagnosis Question 10. Are there 
history and physical examination 
findings that would warrant ob -
taining advanced imaging studies?A systematic review of the literature yielded no studies to adequately ad -
dress this question.
Work Group Consensus Statement :
In the absence of reliable evidence supporting an absolute indication for 
advanced imaging based upon history and physical examination in the specif-
ically-defined patient population, it is the work group’s opinion that, in pa -
tients with severe and intractable pain syndromes who have failed medical/
interventional treatment, advanced imaging may be indicated. Subgroups of 
patients have been shown to have a higher or lower incidence of radiograph -
ic abnormalities based upon acuity of low back pain, tenderness to palpation 
and provocation maneuvers; however, the utility of these findings in guiding 
treatment is not clear.  
Imaging
Imaging Question 1.  What is the 
association between low back pain 
and spondylosis on routine radiog -
raphy?There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against an 
association between low back pain and spondylosis using routine radiogra -
phy. 
Grade of Recommendation: I  
Imaging Question 2.  Is there evi -
dence to support the use of com -
puted tomography (CT) or mag -
netic resonance imaging (MRI) for 
the evaluation of low back pain in 
the absence of x-ray/radiographic 
abnormality?A systematic review of the literature yielded no studies to adequately ad -
dress this question.
Imaging Question 3.  In patients 
with low back pain, does duration 
of symptoms correlate with abnor -
mal findings on imaging? A systematic review of the literature yielded no studies to adequately ad -
dress this question. Recommendations were developed based on a specific definition, inclusion/exclusion criteria, and the resulting literature which excluded conditions 
such as presence of a neurological deficit or leg pain experienced below the knee, among others. Given the exclusion criteria, these guideline rec-
ommendations address a subset of low back pain care as opposed to low back pain in its entirety. This clinical guideline is not intended to be a fixed

Imaging Question 4.  What is the 
optimal imaging protocol that 
should be used in the setting of 
low back pain? 
4a. Are unique MRI sequences con -
sidered preferential or optimal?There is insufficient evidence that unique magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
sequences can be considered preferential or optimal. 
Grade of Recommendation: I  
4b. What is the history and clinical 
presentation that suggests the use 
of contrast enhanced imaging in 
patients with low back pain?A systematic review of the literature yielded no studies to adequately ad -
dress this question.
4c. Is there evidence to support im -
aging the lumbar spine in an oblique 
plane?A systematic review of the literature yielded no studies to adequately ad -

back pain?A systematic review of the literature yielded no studies to adequately ad -
dress this question.
Imaging Question 5.  In the ab -
sence of red flags, what are the 
imaging (x-ray, CT or MRI) recom -
mendations for patients with acute 
or chronic low back pain?There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against ob -
taining imaging in the absence of red flags. 
Grade of Recommendation: I  
Imaging Question 6. Are there im-
aging findings that correlate with 
the presence of low back pain?There is insufficient evidence for or against imaging findings correlating with 
the presence of low back pain.
Grade of Recommendation: I  
Imaging Question 7.  Are there 
imaging findings that contribute 
to decision-making by health care 
providers to guide treatment? There is insufficient evidence to determine whether imaging findings contrib -
ute to decision-making by health care providers to guide treatment.
Grade of Recommendation: I  
Medical and Psychological Treatment
Med/Psych Question 1.  Is smoking 
cessation effective in decreasing 
the frequency of low back pain 
episodes?A systematic review of the literature yielded no studies to adequately ad -
dress this question. Recommendations were developed based on a specific definition, inclusion/exclusion criteria, and the resulting literature which excluded conditions 
such as presence of a neurological deficit or leg pain experienced below the knee, among others. Given the exclusion criteria, these guideline rec-
ommendations address a subset of low back pain care as opposed to low back pain in its entirety. This clinical guideline is not intended to be a fixed

to-work status with SMT following 
an episode of low back pain? There is conflicting evidence that symptoms above the knee, low fear avoid -
ance questionnaire score, at least one hypo-mobile segment, and greater 
than 35° of internal rotation of the hip are predictive of responding to spinal 
manipulative therapy (SMT) for patients with acute low back pain.

undergoing treatment for low back 
pain, what are the outcomes, in -
cluding duration of pain, intensity 
of pain, functional outcomes and 
return-to-work status, for bed rest 
versus active exercise? It is suggested that, for patients with acute low back pain, those that exercise 
more at baseline and use exercise to facilitate recovery are predicted to have 
better functional outcomes over time than patients who do not exercise or 
use bed rest to help with recovery. 
Grade of Recommendation: B   
For patients with acute low back pain, it is suggested that advice to remain 
active within limits of pain compared to short periods of bed rest from 3 to 7 
days all result in similar outcomes in pain and function at short- and medi -
um-term follow-up. 
Grade of Recommendation: B   
Work Group Consensus Statement: In the absence of reliable evidence for

Introduction
This section of the guideline deals with the diagno-
sis of low back pain (LBP) as defined specifically for 
this project.  As the questions were developed, there 
were two main focuses. The authors were interested 
in determining if there were specific patient charac-
teristics that would be useful in identifying structural 
abnormalities of the spine. The rationale behind this 
strategy was that structural abnormalities would have 
specific treatments and the ability to identify such 
patients early in the process may allow for expedited 
specific treatment for subgroups of patients. The sec-
ond emphasis related to identification of patient char-
acteristics that could predict the time course of an ep-
isode of back pain. Again, the rationale was to attempt 
to identify patients at high risk for conversion from 
an acute episode to a more chronic condition in order 
to rationally allocate aggressive treatment strategies. 
Because back pain is so prevalent, there is an abun-
dance of literature from multiple sources and the 
panel reviewed thousands of references. Eventual-
ly, the references were pruned down to slightly more 
than 600 selected manuscripts. As the literature was 
reviewed, several issues arose that require comment. 
First of all, it is recognized that many assessments of 
LBP are not necessarily focused on structural abnor-
malities but may be focused on functional or dynamic 
characteristics of the pain syndrome. These assess-
ments were not adequately addressed in this section 
because of the a priori link between assessment and 
structural abnormality in our question set. 
Second, defining the gold standard for a “structural 
abnormality” as a cause of LBP was extremely prob-
lematic. References reporting correlations between 
different assessment methods, assessment methods 
and injections, assessment methods and surgery and 
assessment methods and specific noninvasive thera-
pies were identified. When such studies were well-do-ne, the results were reported as providing high-qual-
ity evidence regarding the correlation between the 
assessment method and the test or treatment em-
ployed as a comparator. For example, a study of pa-
tients with tenderness over the sacroiliac joint may 
correlate well with a positive response to a sacroiliac 
joint injection. However, with regard to the primary 
question, the panel could not agree that a “gold stan-
dard” exists for the diagnosis of LBP due to the wide 
range of treatment efficacy when patients are selected 
for therapies based on a purported “gold standard.” 
There was uncertainty as to whether the “gold stan-
dard” was therefore inaccurate or if the treatment 
methods based on that standard were simply vari-
ably effective. Therefore, with regard to the diagnosis 
of LBP, the evidence derived from these studies was 
downgraded. 
Third, the majority of the literature dealing with the 
assessment of patients with LBP includes patients 
with radicular complaints. Studies were considered 
for inclusion only if patients with leg pain were ex-
cluded or if a subgroup analysis was provided allow-
ing for assessment of only patients without radicular 
pain/radiculopathy. If, however, patients with radic-
ular complaints were included in a study and a sub-
group analysis was not provided, the study did not 
meet the population targeted by this guideline effort 
and was discarded. Unfortunately, many well-known 
and highly-cited papers fall into this latter category.  
Fourth, many of the best-designed and best-performed 
prognosis papers looking at recovery from an acute 
episode of LBP used return to work (RTW) as their 
primary outcome measure without an assessment of 
LBP during the follow-up period. The author panel 
felt that the use of RTW represented a potentially false 
endpoint as it relates to the resolution or persistence 
of LBP. It is recognized that patients may return to  Recommendations were developed based on a specific definition, inclusion/exclusion criteria, and the resulting literature which excluded conditions 
such as presence of a neurological deficit or leg pain experienced below the knee, among others. Given the exclusion criteria, these guideline rec-
ommendations address a subset of low back pain care as opposed to low back pain in its entirety. This clinical guideline is not intended to be a fixed

QQwork despite persistent pain and that patients whose 
pain has resolved may choose not to return to work. For 
this reason, references that used RTW as the outcome 
measure without a concomitant assessment of relevant 
patient-reported outcomes were downgraded with 
respect to the level of evidence. Finally, some observations consistently reported by 
numerous authors were not specifically addressed by 
the initial question set. The author group felt it ap-
propriate to include statements reflecting such ob-
servations where applicable.
Diagnosis Question 1. In patients with low back pain, are there specific history or 
physical examination findings that would indicate the structure causing pain and, 
therefore, guide treatment?

There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against the use of innominate 
kinematics for the assessment of sacroiliac joint pain.
 Grade of Recommendation: I   
Adhia et al1 conducted a single-blinded cross-sectional 
case-control study to compare the innominate 
kinematic measures (movement pattern, range of 
motion and trends of rotation) of participants with 
LBP of sacroiliac joint (SIJ) origin versus participants 
with LBP of non-SIJ origin. Participants with LBP ≥ 
3 months (n=122) underwent a clinical examination 
with valid and reliable noninvasive SIJ symptom 
provocation tests to be classified as SIJ-positive (≥ 
3 familiar symptom reproduction pain provocation 
tests) or SIJ-negative. The clinical evaluation was 
followed by innominate kinematic testing by a 
blinded tester using an electromagnetic palpation-
digitization technique. Disability (Modified Oswestry 
Low Back Pain Disability Questionnaire), level of physical activity, duration of pain and current 
intensity of pain per the visual analog scale (VAS) were 
recorded. Innominate range of motion, movement 
patterns and trend of rotation were recorded and 
compared between SIJ-positive and SIJ-negative 
participants. Results demonstrated that SIJ-positive 
participants had significantly different innominate 
movement patterns and trends of rotation, but not 
innominate ranges of motion. The authors concluded 
that there was an association between SI joint pain 
and altered innominate kinematics. This study 
provides Level III evidence that altered innominate 
kinematics is associated with 3 out of 5 positive 
sacroiliac provocation tests and may be considered for 
the diagnosis of SI joint pain. Recommendations were developed based on a specific definition, inclusion/exclusion criteria, and the resulting literature which excluded conditions 
such as presence of a neurological deficit or leg pain experienced below the knee, among others. Given the exclusion criteria, these guideline rec-
ommendations address a subset of low back pain care as opposed to low back pain in its entirety. This clinical guideline is not intended to be a fixed 
treatment protocol; it is anticipated that there will be patients who require more or less treatment than what is outlined. This clinical guideline should 
not be construed as including all proper methods of care or excluding other acceptable methods of care reasonably directed to obtaining the same 
results. The ultimate judgment regarding any specific procedure or treatment is to be made by the physician and patient in light of all circumstances 
presented by the patient and the needs and resources particular to the locality or institution.

There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against the assessment of centralization 
or peripheralization for the prediction of discography results.
 Grade of Recommendation: I  In a retrospective chart review, Depalma et al2 aimed 
to estimate the sensitivity, specificity, positive and 
negative predictive values, diagnostic accuracy and 
likelihood ratios of positive and negative tests for 
diagnosing internal disc disruption (IDD), facet 
joint pain (FJP) or sacroiliac joint pain (SIJP) by use 
of presence of midline and paramidline LBP. During 
the clinical evaluation, patients pointed to the most 
painful LBP with one finger, which was documented 
as midline (by the spinous processes) or paramid-
line (more than one fingerbreadth lateral to the mid-
line). Charts of patients with a definitive diagnosis for 
source of LBP were reviewed and classified as IDD, 
FJP, or SIJP. In cases of IDD, significantly great per-
centages of patients reported midline LBP compared 
to FJP or SIJP and significantly lower percentages of patients reported paramidline pain compared to FJP 
or SIJP. The diagnostic accuracy of midline LBP was 
83.5% for IDD, 24.1% for FJP and 31.8% for SIJP. The 
authors concluded that the spine specialist can pre-
dict the likely source of the patient’s LBP by evaluat-
ing the location of LBP as the presence of midline LBP 
increases the probability of lumbar IDD and reduces 
the probability of symptomatic FJ and SIJ dysfunction. 
This study provides Level I evidence that location of 
pain can predict response to the injection and Level III 
evidence that the presence of midline LBP increases 
the probability of lumbar IDD and reduces the prob-
ability of symptomatic FJ and SIJ dysfunction. The 
presence of isolated paramidline LBP increases the 
probability of symptomatic FJ or SIJ but mildly reduc-
es the likelihood of lumbar IDD.
Donelson el al3 investigated the relationship between 
responses of centralization and peripheralization with 
discographic findings in a prospective blinded study 
of patients with chronic LBP greater than 3 months. 
Patients who were scheduled for discography were 
enrolled in the study (n=63). Participants underwent 
an initial McKenzie mechanical assessment by a ther-
apist blinded to medical records and were classified 
as centralizers, peripheralizers, or no change. During 
discography that immediately followed the assess-
ment, pain response was assessed to disc injection 
and axial CT was performed on all painful discs. Exact 
pain reproduction and an abnormal image were cri-
teria for a positive discogram. Of the 31 centralizers, 
23 (74%) had a positive discogram; 21 (91%) of those had a competent annular wall of the positive disc. Of 
the 16 peripheralizers, 11 (69%) had a positive discog-
ram; 6 (54%) of those had a competent annular wall. 
Of the 16 with no change upon initial assessment, only 
2 (12.5%) had a positive discogram, both with com-
petent annular walls. The authors concluded that the 
McKenzie assessment process reliably differentiated 
discogenic versus nondiscogenic pain as well as com-
petent versus incompetent annulus in symptomat-
ic discs. This study provides Level III evidence that 
patients who centralize or peripheralize pain with 
McKenzie exercises have a higher incidence of posi-
tive discogram than those with no change. Those who 
centralize have a higher incidence of an intact annu-
lus as compared to those whose pain peripheralized.
Future Directions for Research
It is recognized that the vast majority of LBP does not have an identifiable struc-
tural cause. The term “nonspecific low back pain” provides no biologic basis 
for LBP nor assistance in clinical decision-making. Therefore, future research 
should focus on reliably identifying clusters of history and physical examination 
findings which can classify patients into subgroups to be validated by identifying 
predictably effective treatments. Further studies of nonspecific LBP are unwar-
ranted.FLASK Recommendations were developed based on a specific definition, inclusion/exclusion criteria, and the resulting literature which excluded conditions 
such as presence of a neurological deficit or leg pain experienced below the knee, among others. Given the exclusion criteria, these guideline rec-
ommendations address a subset of low back pain care as opposed to low back pain in its entirety. This clinical guideline is not intended to be a fixed

QQDiagnosis Question 2. In patients with low back pain, are there history or physical 
examination findings that would serve as predictors for the recurrence of low 
back pain?
There is insufficient evidence to indicate that body mass index (BMI) is a potential predictor of a 
recurrence of low back pain.
 Grade of Recommendation: I  
Heuch et al1 conducted a prospective cohort study to 
evaluate the relationship between an elevated body 
mass index (BMI) and probability of experiencing 
chronic LBP in individuals with and without LBP at 
baseline. Participants in the Norwegian HUNT 2 study 
were included for analysis (n=25,450). Participants 
included those with LBP at baseline (2,669 men and 
3,899 women) and without LBP at baseline (8,733 men 
and 10,149 women). Subjects indicated presence of LBP &gt;3 months at baseline and after 11 years. Results 
revealed a significant positive association between 
BMI and risk of LBP among individuals without LBP 
at baseline. There was a significant positive associa-
tion between BMI and LBP recurrence among women. 
The authors concluded that elevated BMI might pre-
dispose to chronic LBP over 11 years. This study pro-
vides Level II evidence that increasing BMI is associ-
ated with higher reporting of back pain in long-term 
follow-up in women.
It is suggested that history of low back pain is a potential predictor of a recurrence of low back 
pain.

Kääriä et al2 evaluated symptoms, chronic disorders, 
low back clinical findings and work absenteeism and 
their relationship to inpatient hospitalization in a pro-
spective cohort study. Employees of a manufacturing 
facility in Finland who agreed to participate (n=902) 
underwent a health examination and completed a 
questionnaire. Personal data and clinical information, 
including low back diagnoses, were available through 
a Finnish Register. Hazard rate ratios of hospitaliza-
tion due to a low back disorder were analyzed. The au-
thors concluded that predictors of inpatient hospital 
care for low back disorders included frequent or radi-ating low back symptoms, chronic low back disorders, 
back-related work absenteeism and clinical findings 
in the low back. This study provides Level I evidence 
that the occurrence of previous episodes of LBP pre-
dicts future episodes of LBP.

The work group encountered numerous high quality prognostic studies with 
heterogeneous study populations including patients with leg pain. In order to 
make useful recommendations, it is recommended that subgroups (ie with or 
without leg pain) be identified and analyzed separately.

It is recommended that psychosocial factors and workplace factors be assessed when 
counseling patients regarding the risk of conversion from acute to chronic low back pain. 
 Grade of Recommendation: A  
Matsudaira et al1 studied prospective cohort data from 
the Japan epidemiological research of Occupation-
related Back pain (JOB) study to assess the association 
between aggravated LBP and psychosocial factors. 
Participating Japanese workers completed a 
questionnaire at baseline (n=5,310) and at one-year 
follow-up (n=3,811) which included information 
regarding LBP. Of the 1,675 individuals with mild 
LBP, 43 (2.6%) developed persistent LBP. Using 
logistic regression, interpersonal stress at work, job 
satisfaction, depression, somatic symptoms, support 
from supervisors, previous sick leave due to LBP and 
family history of LBP with disability were associated 
with the conversion of mild LBP to persistent LBP. 
The authors concluded that psychosocial factors 
are important risk factors for persistent LBP in 
urban Japanese workers. This study provides Level 
I evidence that low job satisfaction, lack of support 
from supervisors, interpersonal stress at home, 
depression, somatic symptoms and family history 
of LBP with disability predicted development of 
persistent LBP related disability. Other risk factors for 
persistent disability included ergonomic factors such 
as bending, twisting, lifting and pushing. 
Bakker et al2 evaluated the use of spinal mechanical 
load as a prognostic factor for the conversion of acute 
nonspecific LBP to persistent (defined as recurrent 
and/or chronic) LBP in a prospective cohort study. 
Subjects with acute LBP &lt;6 weeks were enrolled and 
underwent a baseline assessment (n=97). A trained 
evaluator asked each participant to describe dai-
ly activities and subsequently recorded posture and 
spinal load applied (“no load applied”, “loaded”, or 
“loaded with movement”) on the standardized 24-
hour schedule (24HS) form. Participants completed 
a 6-month follow-up telephone call (n=88) to assess 
changes in characteristics, mechanical load per the 
24HS, and LBP. Sixty percent of the follow-up partic-
ipants reported persistent LBP. Mechanical load was 
not a prognostic factor for persistent LBP, but smok-
ing and advanced age were associated with persistent 
LBP. The authors concluded that mechanical loading 
of the spine is not predictive for chronicity or recur-
rent episodes of LBP. This study provides Level I evi-
dence that smoking and advanced age are predictors 
of conversion of acute to chronic LBP. Alsaadi et al3 aimed to evaluate the association be-
tween sleep quality and pain intensity in patients 
with acute LBP using data from an existing random-
ized controlled trial. Participants from the PACE study 
received paracetamol or placebo until “recovery from 
back pain” for up to 4 weeks and recorded outcome 
data in a weekly diary for 12 weeks. Sleep quality over 
the past 7 days was assessed using the Pittsburgh 
Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and average pain over the 
last 24 hours was rated using a 10-point numerical 
rating scale (NRS). A generalized estimating equation 
model was used with the participants with adequate 
follow-up data (n=1246). Sleep quality and pain in-
tensity both improved over the 12-week follow-up 
period; for every 1-point decrease in sleep quality, 
pain intensity increased by 2.08 points. The authors 
concluded that sleep quality is related to subsequent 
pain intensity in patients with acute LBP. This study 
provides Level I evidence that poor sleep quality as-
sociated with acute LBP is a positive predictor for lack 
of recovery.
Coste et al4 evaluated the associations between vari-
ous risk factors and the natural history of acute LBP 
as well as the impact of LBP on health-related quali-
ty of life (HRQOL). Patients with LBP &lt; 72 hours who 
self-referred to a general practitioner for LBP (n=113) 
completed a baseline assessment which included a 
questionnaire on job satisfaction, pain intensity (on 
a 100-mm VAS), functional disability (Roland Morris 
Disability Questionnaire) and HRQOL (SF-36). Partic-
ipants recorded pain intensity and functional disabil-
ity and had follow-up visits as needed over a 3-month 
period. Independent associations with delayed recov-
ery included prior low back surgery, higher initial 
disability, lower SF-36 and temporary compensation 
status. The authors concluded that work-related fac-
tors and initial HRQOL can contribute to the prognosis 
of LBP. This study provides Level I evidence that pri-
or back disability, high scores on disability question-
naire, temporary disability status and SF-36 general 
health measure were strong determinants of conver-
sion of acute to chronic LBP.
Foster et al5 conducted a multicenter prospective co-
hort study to describe illness perceptions and their 
associations with clinical outcomes at 6 months in 
patients with nonspecific LBP. Patients who consulted  Recommendations were developed based on a specific definition, inclusion/exclusion criteria, and the resulting literature which excluded conditions 
such as presence of a neurological deficit or leg pain experienced below the knee, among others. Given the exclusion criteria, these guideline rec-
ommendations address a subset of low back pain care as opposed to low back pain in its entirety. This clinical guideline is not intended to be a fixed 
treatment protocol; it is anticipated that there will be patients who require more or less treatment than what is outlined. This clinical guideline should 
not be construed as including all proper methods of care or excluding other acceptable methods of care reasonably directed to obtaining the same 
results. The ultimate judgment regarding any specific procedure or treatment is to be made by the physician and patient in light of all circumstances 
presented by the patient and the needs and resources particular to the locality or institution.

a general practice for LBP completed questionnaires 
that included RMDQ and Revised Illness Perception 
Questionnaire (IPQ-R) at enrollment (n=1,591) and 
6 months (n=810). Patients who expected their back 
problem to last a long time, who perceived serious 
consequences and who held weak beliefs in the con-
trollability of their back problem were more likely to 
have poor clinical outcomes after 6 months. The au-
thors concluded that patient perceptions about their 
back pain predict clinical outcomes 6 months after 
consulting their doctor. This study provides Level II 
evidence that patient expectations at baseline, fear of 
adverse consequences and perception of lack of con-
trol predicted 6-month outcomes.
In a longitudinal cohort study, Fritz et al6 aimed to 
determine cut-off values to maximize the predictive 
ability of nonorganic signs and symptoms in patients 
with acute LBP and their ability to predict return to 
work. Patients with work-related LBP &lt; 3 weeks re-
ferred for physical therapy completed a question-
naire and underwent a physical examination upon 
enrollment. A physical therapist gave each participant 
a score from 0 to 5 based on nonorganic signs pres-
ent during examination. That number was added to 
the nonorganic symptom score based on participant 
questionnaire (0-7) to calculate a nonorganic index. 
Participants completed the recommended physical 
therapy, were reevaluated after 4 weeks and were di-
chotomously categorized as returned to work without 
restrictions or not. The presence of 2 or more signs, 
3 or more symptoms and an index score of 3 or more 
were the best cut-off values. The areas under the 
curve ranged from 0.60 to 0.63 which indicate only 
slightly greater predictive ability than that expected 
by chance. The authors concluded that the nonorgan-
ic tests were not effective screening tools, even with 
optimal cut-off values. This study provides Level III 
evidence that nonorganic signs are not a predictor of 
acute LBP resolution. 
Hancock et al7 prospectively studied data from a ran-
domized controlled trial to develop a simple prognos-
tic rule to help clinicians identify patients with acute 
LBP. Patients who presented to a general practitioner 
in Australia with LBP &lt; 6 weeks were enrolled in a ran-
domized controlled trial in which they received place-
bo versus active spinal manipulative therapy and pla-
cebo versus active diclofenac. Prognostic factors were 
recorded such as average pain over 24 hours, disabili-
ty, function, gender, age, duration of current episode, 
number of previous episodes, area of symptoms, 
segmental mobility, hip internal rotation range, fear 
of pain (fear avoidance beliefs questionnaire), cata-strophizing, coping and physiotherapist’s prediction 
score. Recovery was defined as a pain score of 0 or 1 on 
a 0-10 scale for 7 consecutive days per individual pain 
diaries. In the eligible sample (n=239), lower than av-
erage initial pain intensity, shorter duration of symp-
toms and fewer episodes were found to be prognostic 
factors to predict patients who recover quickly. The 
authors concluded that, although it needs external 
validation before recommending for clinical use, the 
simple clinical prediction rule (CPR) can help primary 
care clinicians identify prognosis better than clinician 
judgement in terms of days to recovery for patients 
with acute LBP. In critique of the methodology, the 
work group downgraded this potential Level I study 
due to inclusion of patients with radiculopathy; how-
ever, an appropriate subgroup multivariate analysis 
was completed. This study provides Level II evidence 
that patients with acute LBP who report more severe 
pain (&gt;7 out of 10), have longer than 5 days duration 
of pain and who have previous episodes of acute LBP 
are less likely to recover rapidly from the episode. 
Shaw et al8 aimed to determine if disability risk fac-
tors could predict one-month clinical outcomes of 
functional limitation and return to work in patients 
with work-related LBP. Enrolled participants (n=568) 
completed a questionnaire at baseline and after one 
month that included physical health risks, workplace 
factors, pain, mood and expectations for recovery. 
Outcome measures included functional limitation 
(RMDQ) and return to work. Employer factors and 
self-ratings of pain and mood better predicted func-
tional improvement and return to work compared to 
health history or physical examination. The authors 
concluded that identification and intervention fo-
cused on job factors, pain coping strategies and ex-
pectations for recovery may improve outcomes. The 
work group downgraded this potential Level I study 
due to uncertainty regarding the patient population, 
specifically regarding radiculopathy. This study pro-
vides Level II evidence that risk factors for prolonged 
disability and the converse of recovery from LBP at 30 
days include job circumstances, pain coping strate-
gies and poor expectation for recovery. 
In a prospective cohort, Shaw et al9 assessed the re-
lationship between BMI and pain and function out-
comes in work-related LBP. Participants with LBP ≤ 
14 days (n=607) reported height, weight, pain, func-
tional limitation and work status at baseline and af-
ter one and 3 months. Participants were categorized 
as normal, overweight or obese based on BMI for data 
analysis. There were no significant differences in out-
comes of pain, functional limitation (RMDQ) or return  Recommendations were developed based on a specific definition, inclusion/exclusion criteria, and the resulting literature which excluded conditions 
such as presence of a neurological deficit or leg pain experienced below the knee, among others. Given the exclusion criteria, these guideline rec-
ommendations address a subset of low back pain care as opposed to low back pain in its entirety. This clinical guideline is not intended to be a fixed 
treatment protocol; it is anticipated that there will be patients who require more or less treatment than what is outlined. This clinical guideline should 
not be construed as including all proper methods of care or excluding other acceptable methods of care reasonably directed to obtaining the same 
results. The ultimate judgment regarding any specific procedure or treatment is to be made by the physician and patient in light of all circumstances 
presented by the patient and the needs and resources particular to the locality or institution.

to work based on categorization of BMI. The authors 
concluded that BMI is not a useful prognostic factor 
for work-related acute or subacute LBP. This study 
provides Level II evidence that BMI is not predictive 
of transition to chronicity in the workers compensa-
tion population.
Gatchel et al10 assessed the relationship between psy-
chological characteristics and conversion of acute to 
chronic LBP. A total of 324 participants with acute 
LBP ≤ 6 weeks completed assessments at baseline 
including pain and disability (Million VAS), psycho-
pathology (Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-
III-R) and Minnesota Multiphasic Personality In-
ventory (MMPI). After 6 months, patients completed 
a telephone questionnaire and were categorized as 
currently working or in training/school (n=274), not 
currently working due to original back injury (n=36) 
or not currently working due to factors other than 
original back injury (n=14; not analyzed in this study). 
The disabled group had higher self-reported pain and 
disability, more individuals with a personality disor-
der and higher scores on Scale 3 of the MMPI. The au-
thors concluded that the presence of these psychoso-
cial variables is associated with injured workers who 
are likely to convert from acute to chronic LBP. In cri-
tique of the methodology, the work group downgrad-
ed this potential Level I study due to the inclusion of 
workers with a history of “chronic back pain” in the 
original cohort. This study provides Level II evidence 
that workers with more severe LBP, increased psy-
chological distress and/or personality disorders are 
more likely to remain off work 6 months after acute 
episode.
Gatchel et al11 evaluated the effectiveness of a psycho-
social and personality assessment in predicting the 
transition of acute LBP to chronic pain disability. Par-
ticipants (n=421) with LBP for less than 6 weeks com-
pleted assessments including the DSM-III-R Diag-
nosis, Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory 
and Million Visual Pain Analog Scale. Return-to-work 
status was collected at 6- and 12-month follow-up 
telephone calls. Participants were categorized as cur-
rently working or in training/school (n=365), not 
currently working due to original back injury (n=29), 
or not currently working due to factors other than 
original back injury (n=27; not analyzed in this study). 
Compared to the nondisabled group, the participants 
not currently working due to the original back injury 
had higher pain and disability analog scores, higher 
MMPI Scale 3 scores and proportionately more in-
dividuals with workers compensation and person-
al injury cases. Major psychopathology (depression and substance abuse) did not precede or cause devel-
opment of chronic pain disability. The authors con-
cluded that their statistical algorithm to determine a 
“psychosocial disability factor” can predict patients 
with acute LBP that will likely develop into chronic 
disability. The work group downgraded this poten-
tial Level I study due to the inclusion of some work-
ers with preexisting chronic LBP in the cohort. This 
study provides Level II evidence that initial pain and 
disability MMPI score, female gender and insurance 
status can predict return to work one year following 
acute LBP episode.
Reme et al12 conducted a study to identify clusters 
of self-reported concerns and expectations in 
individuals with LBP who would benefit from early 
intervention. Participants with acute LBP related 
to work (n=496) completed a questionnaire with 
11 possible risk factors upon enrollment and a 
follow-up questionnaire assessing pain, functional 
limitation and work status after 3 months. Eight of 
the risk factors had significant associations with the 
outcomes and were used to create 4 clusters: minimal 
risk (best functional outcomes), workplace concerns, 
activity limitations and emotional distress (poorest 
functional outcomes). The authors concluded that 
questionnaires that contain pain-related concerns 
and expectations can be useful to identify patients 
with LBP who could benefit from early intervention. 
This study provides Level II evidence that recovery 
expectations, life impact of pain, organizational 
support, kinesiophobia, functional limitation, 
pain catastrophizing, depressive symptoms and 
pain intensity showed significant associations 
with functional recovery and return to work. These 
measures were entered into the cluster analysis. A 
4-cluster solution met criteria for cluster separation 
and interpretability and the 4 clusters were labeled: 
(a) minimal risk (29 %), (b) workplace concerns (26 
%), (c) activity limitations (27%) and (d) emotional 
distress (19 %). Functional outcomes were best in the 
minimal risk group, poorest in the emotional distress 
group and intermediate in the other two groups.
Rolli Salathe et al13 aimed to identify work-related 
resources to predict sickness absence in individuals 
with LBP. Employed individuals with acute (&lt;6 
weeks) or subacute (&lt;12 weeks) LBP (n=279) 
completed a questionnaire at baseline and after one

questionnaire as days missed from work due to LBP. 
Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that life 
satisfaction, work-related FABQ and sickness absence 
at baseline were predictors of sickness absence after 
one year. The authors concluded that life satisfaction 
was a predictor of sickness absence after one year. This 
study provides Level III evidence that life satisfaction, 
job satisfaction and social support decreased sickness 
absence at baseline and one-year follow-up. 
In a prospective cohort study, Shaw et al14 evaluated 
the effect of psychiatric diagnoses on the likelihood 
of transitioning from subacute to chronic LBP. Men 
presenting to their provider with LBP for 6-10 weeks 
completed an assessment at baseline (n=140) and after 
6 months (n=120) which included a standardized or-
thopedic evaluation, structured psychodiagnostic in-
terview (Diagnostic Interview Schedule Version III-R 
[DIS]) and details on pain intensity (Descriptor Dif-
ferential Scale [DDS]) and Disability (Sickness Impact 
Profile [SIP]). The outcome of transition to chronic 
pain was defined as SIP score &gt;10 and DDS score for 
pain intensity &gt;10 at 6-month follow-up. Men with a 
diagnosis of major depressive disorder, generalized 
anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), or 
current nicotine dependence had greater risk of tran-
sitioning to chronic LBP. The authors concluded that 
screening for depressive disorder or anxiety disorder 
may identify individuals with greater risk of transi-
tion to chronic LBP. Due to the subacute patient popu-
lation, the work group determined this study provid-
ed Level II evidence that risk of conversion to chronic 
pain in male patients was significantly elevated in the 
presence of a lifetime diagnosis of major depression, 
PTSD and generalized anxiety or a diagnosis of nico-
tine dependence in the past 6 months.
Turner et al15 assessed the predictive value of work-
er demographic, pain, disability and psychosocial 
variables on 6-month work disability in individ-
uals with work-related LBP. Individuals who sub-
mitted a workers’ compensation back pain disabili-
ty claim (n=1,068) completed a telephone interview 
that addressed pain intensity (on a scale from 0 to 
10), disability (RMDQ), catastrophizing (Pain Cata-
strophizing Scale), recovery expectations, coworker 
relations, and blame. The outcome measure of work 
disability was wage replacement compensation for 
total disability after initially submitting the claim. At 
6 months, predictors of disability included age, race, 
education and baseline pain and disability. High levels 
of fear-avoidance and low expectations of recovery 
were independent predictors of 6-month disability. 
The authors concluded that in the studied population, risk factors for chronic work disability include high 
pain and disability, low recovery expectations and 
fears that work may increase pain or cause harm. The 
work group initially rated this study as a Level II due 
to uncertainty regarding the duration of enrollment, 
but downgraded the level of evidence to a Level III due 
to the outcome of “not being paid” for return to work. 
This was felt to introduce an additional false endpoint 
that may not have been completely dependent upon 
the resolution of back pain. Therefore, this study pro-
vides Level III evidence that workers with lower re-
covery expectations and greater work fear avoidance 
at baseline were significantly (P &lt; 0.05) more likely to 
be receiving work disability wage replacement com-
pensation at 6 months.
Melloh et al16 investigated factors that influence the 
progression of acute LBP to persistent LBP in an in-
ception cohort study of patients presenting to a health 
practitioner for acute LBP. Enrolled participants 
(n=62) completed a questionnaire at baseline and were 
invited to complete follow-up questionnaires after 3, 
6, 12 weeks and 6 months. Predictor variables were 
combined into three indices: “working conditions,” 
“depression and maladaptive cognitions” and “pain 
and quality of life.” Persistent LBP was defined as an 
Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) score &gt;10 points after 
6 weeks. In the participants who followed up after 6 
months (n=53), the index “depression and maladap-
tive cognitions” (depression, somatization, resigned 
attitude towards the job, fear-avoidance, rumination, 
helplessness, catastrophizing and negative expecta-
tions on return to work) at baseline was a significant 
predictor for transition of acute to persistent LBP. The 
authors concluded that psychological factors at base-
line correlated with progression from acute to per-
sistent LBP at 6 months and may be beneficial to add 
into screening tools. In critique of the methodology, 
the work group downgraded this potential Level I ar-
ticle due to concerns of select patient population and 
sample size. This study provides Level II evidence that 
depression and maladaptive cognitions are a signifi-
cant risk factor for conversion from acute to chronic 
LBP at 6 months. 
Sewitch et al17 conducted a secondary analysis of data 
from a randomized controlled trial on the effective-
ness of a back school program in order to find the re-
lationship between psychological factors and recovery 
from first episode of LBP. Participants (n=134) with a 
first occurrence of LBP receiving workers’ compensa-
tion with the inability to work due to LBP completed 
baseline assessments. Demographics, lifestyle hab-
its, job-related variables, mental health status (per  Recommendations were developed based on a specific definition, inclusion/exclusion criteria, and the resulting literature which excluded conditions

Psychiatric Symptom Index and General Well Being 
Scale), functional status (RMDQ) and pain (VAS) were 
recorded. The outcome of late return to work was de-
fined as return to work &gt; 31 days after enrollment in 
study; the outcome of compensated recurrence was 
defined as a subsequent compensated disability due to 
LBP after initial return to work. Multivariate analysis 
revealed that lower psychological distress predicted 
late return to work while higher general well-being, greater control over emotions, higher aggressiveness 
and lower anxiety predicted compensated recurrence. 
The authors concluded that psychological factors do 
not impact clients with all types of LBP the same way. 
The work group downgraded this potential Level II 
study due to nonconsecutive patients and the return-
to-work outcome measure. This study provides Level 
III evidence that history of back pain and psychologi-
cal level of functioning influences return to work in a 
workers’ compensation population.
It is recommended that psychosocial factors be used as prognostic factors for return to work 
following an episode of acute low back pain.

Gatchel et al10 assessed the relationship between psy-
chological characteristics and conversion of acute to 
chronic LBP. A total of 324 participants with acute 
LBP ≤ 6 weeks completed assessments at baseline 
including pain and disability (Million VAS), psycho-
pathology (Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-
III-R) and Minnesota Multiphasic Personality In-
ventory (MMPI). After 6 months, patients completed 
a telephone questionnaire and were categorized as 
currently working or in training/school (n=274), not 
currently working due to original back injury (n=36)
or not currently working due to factors other than 
original back injury (n=14; not analyzed in this study). 
The disabled group had higher self-reported pain and 
disability, more individuals with a personality disor-
der and higher scores on Scale 3 of the MMPI. The au-
thors concluded that the presence of these psychoso-
cial variables is associated with injured workers who 
are likely to convert from acute to chronic LBP. In cri-
tique of the methodology, the work group downgrad-
ed this potential Level I study due to the inclusion of 
workers with a history of “chronic back pain” in the 
original cohort. This study provides Level II evidence 
that workers with more severe LBP, increased psy-
chological distress and/or personality disorders are 
more likely to remain off work 6 months after acute 
episode.
Gatchel et al11 evaluated the effectiveness of a psycho-
social and personality assessment in predicting the 
transition of acute LBP to chronic pain disability. Par-
ticipants (n=421) with LBP for less than 6 weeks com-
pleted assessments including the DSM-III-R Diagno-
sis, Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory and 
Million Visual Pain Analog Scale. Return-to-work sta-
tus was collected at 6- and 12-month follow-up tele-phone calls. Participants were categorized as currently 
working or in training/school (n=365), not current-
ly working due to original back injury (n=29), or not 
currently working due to factors other than original 
back injury (n=27; not analyzed in this study). Com-
pared to the nondisabled group, the participants not 
currently working due to the original back injury had 
higher pain and disability analog scores, higher MMPI 
Scale 3 scores and proportionately more individu-
als with workers compensation and personal injury 
cases. Major psychopathology (depression and sub-
stance abuse) did not precede or cause development 
of chronic pain disability. The authors concluded that 
their statistical algorithm to determine a “psychoso-
cial disability factor” can predict patients with acute 
LBP that will likely develop into chronic disability. The 
work group downgraded this potential Level I study 
due to the inclusion of some workers with preexisting 
chronic LBP in the cohort. This study provides Level II 
evidence that initial pain and disability MMPI score, 
female gender and insurance status can predict return 
to work one year following acute LBP episode.

ous risk factors and the natural history of acute LBP 
as well as the impact of LBP on health-related quali-
ty of life (HRQOL). Patients with LBP &lt; 72 hours who 
self-referred to a general practitioner for LBP (n=113) 
completed a baseline assessment which included a 
questionnaire on job satisfaction, pain intensity (on 
a 100-mm VAS), functional disability (RMDQ) and 
HRQOL (SF-36). Participants recorded pain intensity 
and functional disability and had follow-up visits as 
needed over a 3-month period. Independent associ-
ations with delayed recovery included prior low back 
surgery, higher initial disability, lower SF-36 and 
temporary compensation status. The authors con-cluded that work-related factors and initial HRQOL 
can contribute to the prognosis of LBP. This study

Australia. Patients who initially presented to primary 
care with acute (&lt;2 weeks) LBP which transitioned to 
chronic (&gt;3 months) LBP were included in this study 
(n=406). A telephone interview was conducted at on-
set of chronic LBP and after 9 and 12 months to as-
sess potential prognostic factors as well as intensity 
of pain, disability and work status. Participants were 
considered to be completely recovered when they 
reported they were pain free, had no disability from 
back pain and returned to work for 30 consecutive 
days. Delayed recovery was associated with previous 
sick leave due to low LBP, high disability levels or pain 
intensity at onset of chronic LBP, low levels of edu-
cation, greater perceived risk of persistent pain and 
birthplace outside of Australia. The authors conclud-
ed that the prognosis for individuals with chronic LBP 
is moderately optimistic; they identified prognostic 
factors that may make prognosis less favorable. This 
study provides Level II evidence that patients who do 
not rapidly recover from acute LBP who are at risk for 
developing chronic symptoms have: lower educa-
tion; workers compensation claims; the use of med-
ications; increased disability at acute presentation; 
previous sick leave for LBP; feelings of depression, 
tension or anxiety; high pain intensity; morning back 
stiffness and perception of having a high risk of per-
sistent pain.
Hancock et al7 prospectively studied data from a ran-

were recorded such as average pain over 24 hours, 
disability, function, gender, age, duration of cur-
rent episode, number of previous episodes, area of 
symptoms, segmental mobility, hip internal rotation 
range, fear of pain (fear avoidance beliefs question-
naire), catastrophizing, coping and physiotherapist’s 
prediction score. Recovery was defined as a pain score 
of 0 or 1 on a 0-10 scale for 7 consecutive days per in-
dividual pain diaries. In the eligible sample (n=239),

use, the simple CPR can help primary care clinicians 
identify prognosis better than clinician judgement in 
terms of days to recovery for patients with acute LBP. 
In critique of the methodology, the work group down-
graded this potential Level I study due to inclusion of 
patients with radiculopathy; however, an appropriate 
subgroup multivariate analysis was completed. This 
study provides Level II evidence that patients with 
acute LBP who report more severe pain (&gt;7 out of 10), 
have longer than 5 days duration of pain and who have 
previous episodes of acute LBP are less likely to re-
cover rapidly from episode. 
Friedman et al19 investigated whether 5 high-risk 
variables predict poor functional outcomes in patients 
presenting to the emergency department (ED) for 
nontraumatic LBP classified as musculoskeletal. 
The high-risk variables included baseline functional 
disability related to LBP, radicular signs, depression, 
work-related injury or history of chronic or recurrent 
LBP. In this prospective observational cohort study 
at a single ED, enrolled participants (n=556) were 
interviewed prior to ED discharge which included 
information regarding demographics, duration 
and symptoms of LBP and the RMDQ. Patients’ LBP 
was categorized as chronic, episodic or rare/never. 
Participants were contacted at one week (97% follow-
up) and three months (92% follow-up) post-discharge 
to assess the outcome measure of functional limitation 
per the RMDQ score (score &gt;0 indicating LBP-related 
functional impairment). A higher baseline RMDQ 
score and chronic LBP were each associated with LBP-
related functional disability at 7-day and 3-month 
follow-up. Depression, radicular signs and work-
injury did not predict functional outcome at either 
time point. The authors concluded that, in patients 
presenting to the ED with nontraumatic LBP, those 
with worse baseline functional impairments and history of chronic LBP are more likely to have worse 
short- and long-term functional outcomes. In critique 
of the methodology, the work group downgraded this 
potential Level I study due to the short follow-up 
period. This study provides Level II evidence that high 
initial disability (RMDQ ≥ 17) and a history of previous 
LBP for 30 straight days predicted lack of recovery at 
3 months. 
Neubauer et al20 conducted a prospective cohort study 
with the objective to develop a short and reliable in-
strument to predict the chronicity of LBP. Patients 
presenting to an orthopedic specialist for acute LBP 
&lt;6 months were invited to participate. Participants 
completed a questionnaire at enrollment (n=235) 
and again by mail after 6 months (n=192, 82%) af-
ter receiving standard treatment for LBP. Question-
naires covered 167 items including LBP history and 
pain (VAS), cognitive strategies of pain management, 
psychosomatic comorbidities, subjective well-being, 
depressive symptoms (Zung Depression Index), work 
satisfaction and socio-demographic data. The main 
outcome measure was chronicity of LBP, defined as 
presence of LBP after 6 months. Results revealed that 
pain intensity, tolerance and duration, as well as edu-
cational level, pain experienced elsewhere in the body, 
depression, female gender, catastrophizing thoughts, 
and feelings of helplessness were strong predictors 
for the development of chronic LBP. The authors con-
cluded that a questionnaire with these items can pre-
dict a patient’s risk of developing chronic LBP with a 
probability of 78%. This study provides Level II evi-
dence that pain intensity and acceptance, response 
to massage therapy, duration of pain, patient educa-
tional level, pain elsewhere in body, depression, fe-
male gender, catastrophizing thoughts, and feelings 
of helplessness predicted conversion to chronic LBP 
at 6 months.
It is suggested that prior episodes of low back pain be considered a prognostic factor for the 
conversion from acute to chronic low back pain.

is moderately optimistic; they identified prognostic 
factors that may make prognosis less favorable. This 
study provides Level II evidence that patients who do 
not rapidly recover from acute LBP who are at risk for 
developing chronic symptoms have: lower educa-
tion; workers compensation claims; the use of med-ications; increased disability at acute presentation; 
previous sick leave for LBP; feelings of depression, 
tension or anxiety; high pain intensity; morning back 
stiffness and perception of having a high risk of per-
sistent pain.
Sewitch et al17 conducted a secondary analysis of data 
from a randomized controlled trial of the effective-
ness of a back school program in order to find the re-
lationship between psychological factors and recovery 
from first episode of LBP. Participants (n=134) with a 
first occurrence of LBP receiving workers’ compensa-
tion with the inability to work due to LBP completed 
baseline assessments. Demographics, lifestyle hab-
its, job-related variables, mental health status (per 
Psychiatric Symptom Index and General Well Being 
Scale), functional status (RMDQ) and pain (VAS) were 
recorded. The outcome of late return to work was de-
fined as return to work &gt;31 days after enrollment in 
study; the outcome of compensated recurrence was 
defined as a subsequent compensated disability due to 
LBP after initial return to work. Multivariate analysis 
revealed that lower psychological distress predicted 
late return to work while higher general well-being, 
greater control over emotions, higher aggressiveness 
and lower anxiety predicted compensated recurrence. 
The authors concluded that psychological factors do 
not impact clients with all types of LBP the same way. 
This study provides Level III evidence that history of 
back pain and psychological level of functioning in-
fluences return to work in a workers’ compensation 
population.
There is insufficient evidence to assess sleep quality as a prognostic variable to predict recov -
ery from acute low back pain.
 Grade of Recommendation: I  
Alsaadi et al3 aimed to evaluate the association be-
tween sleep quality and pain intensity in patients with 
acute LBP using data from an existing randomized 
controlled trial. Participants from the PACE study re-
ceived paracetamol or placebo until “recovery from 
back pain” for up to 4 weeks and recorded outcome 
data in a weekly diary for 12 weeks. Sleep quality over 
the past 7 days was assessed using the Pittsburgh 
Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and average pain over the 
last 24 hours was rated using a 10-point numerical 
rating scale (NRS). A generalized estimating equation model was used with the participants with adequate 
follow-up data (n=1246). Sleep quality and pain in-
tensity both improved over the 12-week follow-up 
period; for every 1-point decrease in sleep quality, 
pain intensity increased by 2.08 points. The authors 
concluded that sleep quality is related to subsequent 
pain intensity in patients with acute LBP. This study 
provides Level I evidence that poor sleep quality as-
sociated with acute LBP is a positive predictor for lack 
of recovery. Recommendations were developed based on a specific definition, inclusion/exclusion criteria, and the resulting literature which excluded conditions 
such as presence of a neurological deficit or leg pain experienced below the knee, among others. Given the exclusion criteria, these guideline rec-
ommendations address a subset of low back pain care as opposed to low back pain in its entirety. This clinical guideline is not intended to be a fixed 
treatment protocol; it is anticipated that there will be patients who require more or less treatment than what is outlined. This clinical guideline should 
not be construed as including all proper methods of care or excluding other acceptable methods of care reasonably directed to obtaining the same 
results. The ultimate judgment regarding any specific procedure or treatment is to be made by the physician and patient in light of all circumstances 
presented by the patient and the needs and resources particular to the locality or institution.

There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against the use of smoking 
and/or obesity as prognostic factors for the conversion from acute to chronic low back pain.
 Grade of Recommendation: I  
Bakker et al2 evaluated the use of spinal mechanical 
load as a prognostic factor for the conversion of acute 
nonspecific LBP to persistent (defined as recurrent 
and/or chronic) LBP in a prospective cohort study. 
Subjects with acute LBP &lt;6 weeks were enrolled and 
underwent a baseline assessment (n=97). Spinal me-
chanical load was calculated using the 24HS measure-
ment. Participants completed a 6-month follow-up 
telephone call (n=88) to assess changes in character-
istics, mechanical load per the 24HS and LBP. Sixty 
percent of the follow-up participants reported per-
sistent LBP. Mechanical load was not a prognostic 
factor for persistent LBP, but smoking and advanced 
age were associated with persistent LBP. The authors 
concluded that mechanical loading of the spine is not 
predictive for chronicity or recurrent episodes of LBP. 
This study provides Level I evidence that smoking and 
advanced age are predictors of conversion of acute to 
chronic LBP. 
In a prospective cohort, Shaw et al9 assessed the rela-
tionship between BMI on pain and function outcomes 
in work-related LBP. Participants with LBP ≤14 days 
(n=607) reported height, weight, pain, functional 
limitation and work status at baseline and after one 
and 3 months. Participants were categorized as nor-
mal, overweight or obese based on BMI for data anal-
ysis. There were no significant differences in out-
comes of pain, functional limitation (RMDQ) or return 
to work based on categorization of BMI. The authors 
concluded that BMI is not a useful prognostic factor for work-related acute or subacute LBP. This study 
provides Level II evidence that BMI is not predictive 
of transition to chronicity in the workers compensa-
tion population.
In a prospective cohort study, Shaw et al14 evaluated 
the effect of psychiatric diagnoses on the likelihood 
of transitioning from subacute to chronic LBP. Men 
presenting to their provider with LBP for 6-10 weeks 
completed an assessment at baseline (n=140) and after 
6 months (n=120) which included a standardized or-
thopedic evaluation, structured psychodiagnostic in-
terview (Diagnostic Interview Schedule Version III-R 
[DIS]) and details on pain intensity (DDS) and Dis-
ability (Sickness Impact Profile [SIP]). The outcome 
of transition to chronic pain was defined as SIP score 
&gt;10 and DDS score for pain intensity &gt;10 at 6-month 
follow-up. Men with a diagnosis of major depressive 
disorder, generalized anxiety, post-traumatic stress 
disorder (PTSD) or current nicotine dependence had 
greater risk of transitioning to chronic LBP. The au-
thors concluded that screening for depressive disor-
der or anxiety disorder may identify individuals with 
greater risk of transition to chronic LBP. Due to the 
subacute patient population, the work group deter-
mined this study provided Level II evidence that risk 
of conversion to chronic pain in male patients was 
significantly elevated in the presence of a lifetime di-
agnosis of major depression, PTSD and generalized 
anxiety, or a diagnosis of nicotine dependence in the 
past 6 months.
Future Directions for Research
The work group encountered numerous high quality prognostic studies with 
heterogeneous study populations including patients with leg pain. In order to 
make useful recommendations, it is recommended that subgroups (ie with or 
without leg pain) be identified and analyzed separately.
The work group recommends further research on interventions addressing the 
prognostic factors above and the effect of those interventions on the conver-
sion from acute to chronic LBP.

QQDiagnosis Question 4. In patients with low back pain, what history and/or physical 
examination findings are useful in determining if the cause is nonstructural in nature 
and, therefore, guide treatment?
A nonstructural cause of low back pain may be considered in patients with diffuse low back pain 
and tenderness.
 Grade of Recommendation: C  
Jensen et al1 assessed the associations between the 
number of tender points and spinal structural chang-
es as well as psycho-social factors in a cross-sec-
tional study of patients who were sick-listed due to 
LBP for 3-16 weeks. Participants completed a ques-
tionnaire that included information on LBP and the 
Common Mental Disorders Questionnaire (CMDQ) and underwent a clinical examination that includ-
ed a standardized assessment of tender points. Pa-
tients were classified as nonspecific LBP without leg 
pain (n=96), nonspecific radiating pain (n=119), or 
verified nerve root affection with relevant structur-
al lesion on MRI (n=111). A disc degeneration score 
was computed based on x-ray findings of disc height  Recommendations were developed based on a specific definition, inclusion/exclusion criteria, and the resulting literature which excluded conditions

reductions and patients were classified as “moder-
ate or severe degeneration at minimum one level” 
or “no or slight degeneration at any level.” Results 
revealed that many tender points on exam were as-
sociated with female sex, psychological distress and 
widespread pain. Multiple tender points were neg-
atively associated with disc degeneration (DD) and 
verified root involvement. The authors concluded that 
the presence of multiple tender points indicates that 
the pain syndrome is widespread and unlikely due to a 
specific spinal cause. This study provides Level III ev-
idence that diffuse back tenderness tends to indicate a 
nonstructural cause.
Coste et al2 conducted a descriptive cross-sectional 
study with the aim of developing a clinical and psy-
chological classification of LBP to define treatment 
protocols. Patients presenting to an outpatient clinic 
with chief complaint of LBP of any time duration were included. Participants (n=330) completed a clinical 
interview (including information on LBP and DSM-
III classification) and underwent physical and radio-
graphic examinations. Per DSM-III classification, 136 
patients (41.2%) had at least one psychiatric disorder. 
Diffuse spinal pain, impossibility to assess intensity of 
pain on a pain scale and pain increased by changing 
climate, domestic activities or psychological factors 
were related to the presence of a psychiatric disorder. 
The authors concluded that LBP should be assessed 
both physically and psychologically so that an appro-
priate management may be initiated, which may in-
clude psychiatric therapy. This study provides Level II 
evidence that psychological disorders are common in 
patients with  nonspecific LBP. A combination of dif-
fuse spinal pain, impossibility to assess pain inten-
sity, pain increased by psychological factors, or with 
changing climate and dysesthesias in the back, indi-
cates a nonorganic syndrome. 
There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against the use of fear avoid-
ance behavior to determine the likelihood of a structural cause of low back pain.
 Grade of Recommendation: I   
In a prospective cross-sectional study, Lundberg et 
al3 aimed to describe the occurrence and association 
of fear-avoidance variables (pain intensity, kinesi-
ophobia, depression and disability) in patients with 
specific or  nonspecific chronic LBP. Participants 
with LBP (n=147) were diagnosed as specific (attrib-
utable to a specific pathology such as disc hernia-
tion, isthmic spondylolisthesis and spinal stenosis) 
or  nonspecific (pain not able to be attributed to a 
recognizable specific pathology). Upon enrollment, 
participants completed questionnaires that includ-
ed information on demographics, pain duration, in-
tensity (VAS), disability (Oswestry Disability Index), kinesiophobia (Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia) and 
depressed mood (Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale). 
Both groups of patients, with either specific or  non-
specific chronic LBP, had elevated fear-avoidance val-
ues. All fear-avoidance variables predicted disability 
in all patients with chronic LBP with the exception of 
kinesiophobia in those with  nonspecific chronic LBP. 
The authors concluded that pain must be analyzed and 
treated, in addition to searching for the cause of pain. 
This study provides Level IV evidence that the pres-
ence of fear avoidance behavior does not indicate the 
absence of a specific structural cause of LBP.
There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against the presence of diffuse 
back tenderness for the prediction of the presence of disc degeneration on radiographs.

tender points on exam were associated with female 
sex, psychological distress and widespread pain. Mul-
tiple tender points were negatively associated with DD 
and verified root involvement. The authors concluded that the presence of multiple tender points indicates 
that the pain syndrome is widespread and unlike-
ly due to a specific spinal cause. This study provides 
Level III evidence that diffuse back tenderness tends 
to indicate a nonstructural cause.
Future Directions for Research
The work group recommends further prospective research evaluating the associ-
ation between psychological distress and structural abnormalities of the lumbar 
spine.

QQDiagnosis Question 5. In patients with low back pain, what elements of the 
patient’s history and findings from the physical examination would suggest the 
need for diagnostic laboratory studies?
There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against obtaining laboratory 
tests to assess for inflammatory disease in patients with SI joint pain.
 Grade of Recommendation: I  
Gupta et al1 retrospectively reviewed pain history, 
clinical examination including SIJ provocative tests, 
laboratory investigations and skeletal imaging to de-
scribe the clinical spectrum and propose a diagnos-
tic scheme in patients with LBP due to sacroiliac joint 
(SIJ) involvement. Of the 61 patients with suspected 
SIJ problems, 52 had specific SIJ pathology diagnoses; 
40 of which had rheumatic conditions and 12 of which 
had nonrheumatic conditions. The authors concluded that sacroiliac joint pathology diagnosis was support-
ed by medical history, clinical examination including 
sacroiliac joint tests, plain radiography and labora-
tory investigations and that a diagnostic scheme of 
dividing SIJ pathologies into rheumatic and nonrheu-
matic conditions in these patients was helpful. This 
study provides Level IV evidence that, in patients with 
SI joint pain, laboratory tests should be considered to 
assess for inflammatory disease.
Future Directions for Research: 
The work group recommends prospective studies of patients with sacroiliac joint 
pain to define the role of laboratory investigation in the absence of other signs of 
inflammatory disease.

QQDiagnosis Question 7. In patients with low back pain, are there specific findings 
on a pain diagram that help differentiate the structure which is causing pain?
Diagnosis Question 8. Are there assessment tools or questionnaires that can 
help identify the cause of acute, subacute or chronic low back pain? 
A systematic review of the literature yielded no studies to adequately address these questions 
in this patient population.
Future Directions for Research:
Based upon a review of the available literature, the work group feels that, in the 
specifically-defined patient population, it is unlikely that pain diagrams are going 
to elucidate the cause of LBP.
QQDiagnosis Question 10. Are there history and physical examination findings that 
would warrant obtaining advanced imaging studies?
A systematic review of the literature yielded no studies to adequately address this question.
Work Group Consensus Statement:
In the absence of reliable evidence supporting an absolute indication for advanced imaging based 
upon history and physical examination in the specifically-defined patient population, it is the work 
group’s opinion that, in patients with severe and intractable pain syndromes who have failed med-
ical/interventional treatment, advanced imaging may be indicated. Subgroups of patients have 
been shown to have a higher or lower incidence of radiographic abnormalities based upon acuity 
of low back pain, tenderness to palpation and provocation maneuvers; however, the utility of these 
findings in guiding treatment is not clear.
Future Directions for Research: 
The work group does not have any recommendations for future research on this 
topic.FLASK

QQImaging Question 1. What is the association between low back pain and 
spondylosis on routine radiography?
There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against an association be-
tween low back pain and spondylosis using routine radiography.
 Grade of Recommendation: I  
Nemoto et al1 conducted a longitudinal study to in-
vestigate the development of low back pain (LBP) and 
lumbar degenerative changes. In 1984, 45 Japanese 
male parachutists, aged 18-19 years, in the Japanese 
Self Defense Forces were enrolled. None of the partic-
ipants had a history of LBP, sciatica, neurogenic clau-
dication, or abnormal lumbar spine radiographs at the 
time of enrollment. In 2009, repeat radiographs were 
obtained for 40 of the original subjects who then com-
pleted an updated questionnaire related to LBP (de-
fined as ≥7 consecutive days experienced during the 
year prior to this study), lifestyle habits and number 
of parachute descents. A single trained observer as-
sessed the radiographs and assigned summary grades 
to each lumbar spine based on presence and severity 
of vertebral osteophytes (VOs), disc space narrowing 
(DSN) and facet joint osteoarthrosis (FJOA). The inci-
dence of VOs, DSN, or FJOA was 70%, 48% and 57%, 
respectively. Mild LBP pain was reported by 60% of 
subjects. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that an 
increased risk of VOs was associated with number of 
parachute descents (p=0.025) and DSN (p=0.014). No 
significant association was found between LBP and 
various factors. However, VO development showed a 
greater (nonsignificant) odds ratio (OR 3.80, 95% CI 
0.95-15.20). The authors concluded that, in young and radiologically normal parachutists, frequent 
parachuting descent and newly developed DSN were 
predictors of VO formation. In critique of the meth-
odology, the work group downgraded the level of evi-
dence of this potential Level III study due to the small 
sample size. This study provides Level IV evidence that 
there is an association between vertebral osteophyte 
formation and incidence of LBP.
Nemoto et al2 conducted a longitudinal study to inves-
tigate the association between LBP and the incidence 
of newly developed lumbar degenerative changes at 
middle age. In 1990, 84 Japanese infantry servicemen 
in the Japanese Self Defense Forces, aged 18 years, 
were enrolled after confirming normal anteroposte-
rior, lateral and bilateral oblique lumbar spine radio-
graphs. None of the enrolled participants had a his-
tory of LBP, sciatica or neurogenic claudication. In 
2010, repeat radiographs were obtained for each of the 
original 84 participants who then also completed an 
updated questionnaire related to LBP (defined as ≥7 
consecutive days experienced during the year prior to 
this study) and lifestyle factors. A single trained ob-
server assessed the radiographs and assigned sum-
mary grades to each lumbar spine based on presence 
and severity of vertebral osteophytes (VOs) and DSN.  Recommendations were developed based on a specific definition, inclusion/exclusion criteria, and the resulting literature which excluded conditions 
such as presence of a neurological deficit or leg pain experienced below the knee, among others. Given the exclusion criteria, these guideline rec-
ommendations address a subset of low back pain care as opposed to low back pain in its entirety. This clinical guideline is not intended to be a fixed 
treatment protocol; it is anticipated that there will be patients who require more or less treatment than what is outlined. This clinical guideline should 
not be construed as including all proper methods of care or excluding other acceptable methods of care reasonably directed to obtaining the same 
results. The ultimate judgment regarding any specific procedure or treatment is to be made by the physician and patient in light of all circumstances 
presented by the patient and the needs and resources particular to the locality or institution.

Mild LBP was reported by 44 subjects (52%). No as-
sociation between LBP and lifestyle factors such as 
smoking, sports, alcohol intake or weight gain was 
demonstrated. Lumbar degenerative changes were 
found in 52% of the subjects, with DSN and VOs found 
in 30% and 46% of subjects, respectively. More lum-
bar spine degeneration was found in subjects with LBP 
compared to those without LBP. There was a signifi-
cant correlation between VOs and LBP (OR 3.00, 95% 
CI 1.23-7.33; p=0.013). There was not a significant association between DSN and LBP. The authors con-
cluded that, in young men without initial radiologi-
cal abnormalities, there was a significant association 
between VOs and incidence of mild LBP. In critique 
of the methodology, the work group downgraded the 
level of evidence of this potential Level III study due 
to the small sample size. This study provides Level IV 
evidence that there is an association between verte-
bral osteophyte formation and incidence of LBP. 
Future Directions for Research
The work group recommends the development of studies that incorporate a 
reference standard in patients without other confounding factors such as spon-
dylolisthesis or radiculopathy.

There is insufficient evidence that unique magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences can be

 Grade of Recommendation: I  
Lakadamyali et al1 conducted a retrospective case 
control study to investigate the relationship between 
degenerative changes in posterior spinal elements 
and LBP, as well as to explore the age- and sex-re-
lated distribution of those changes on STIR sequence 
magnetic resonance (MR) images. In the first stage of 
this two-stage study, the MR images of 372 patients 
(231 women, 141 men) with LBP without radiculopa-
thy were evaluated after being referred to a radiology 
department between the years 2000-2004. During the 
second stage, 249 additional volunteers (123 women, 
126 men) without LBP who were referred to the same 
department for other MRI examinations, formed a 
control group. Conventional and sagittal STIR se-
quences were obtained for all subjects. Two experi-
enced radiologists evaluated the lumbar MR images 
and recorded presence of intervertebral disc degen-
eration (DD), disc herniation, interspinous ligament 
degeneration or rupture, facet joint effusion, neocyst 
formation, intrinsic spinal muscular degeneration 
and/or subcutaneous edema. Compared to patients without LBP, patients with LBP had higher incidenc-
es of facet joint effusion (p=0.0001), interspinous 
ligament edema (p=0.001 for T12-L1; p=0.0001 for 
all lumbar levels), neocyst formation (p=0.0001) and 
intrinsic muscle degeneration (p=0.0001). The inci-
dences of intervertebral DD, disc herniation, subcuta-
neous edema and muscle edema were similar in sub-
jects with and without LBP, but increased with age in 
both groups. Relevant posterior paraspinal changes 
were better visualized with STIR imaging than rou-
tine MRI. The authors concluded that the percentage 
of posterior paraspinal degenerative change findings 
was higher in subjects with LBP compared to those 
without LBP and that the use of the STIR sequence im-
proved the visualization of those changes. This study 
provides Level III evidence that patients with LBP had 
significantly higher rates of facet joint effusion, in-
terspinous ligament edema, neocyst formation and 
paraspinal muscle edema. The incidence of interver-
tebral DD, disc herniation and subcutaneous edema in 
persons with and without LBP were similar. Recommendations were developed based on a specific definition, inclusion/exclusion criteria, and the resulting literature which excluded conditions 
such as presence of a neurological deficit or leg pain experienced below the knee, among others. Given the exclusion criteria, these guideline rec-
ommendations address a subset of low back pain care as opposed to low back pain in its entirety. This clinical guideline is not intended to be a fixed

QQImaging Question 5. In the absence of red flags, what are the imaging (x-ray, CT 
or MRI) recommendations for patients with acute or chronic low back pain?
There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against obtaining imaging 
in the absence of red flags. 
 Grade of Recommendation: I  
One Level II study shows that in the absence of red 
flags, x-ray does not provide additional benefit at 
initial consultation. Kerry et al1 performed a random-
ized controlled trial (RCT) with an observational arm 
across 94 general practices in South London and the 
South Thames region in order to compare outcomes of 
patients with LBP who were immediately referred for 
lumbar spine x-ray with those who were not. Over the 
course of 26 months, patients with LBP, aged 16-64 
years, were allocated into a RCT (n=153) or an obser-
vational arm (n=506) at the time they consulted their 
general practitioners. Allocation into these groups 
was determined by sealed envelope or per the discre-
tion of the individual practitioner. The patients in the 
RCT group were then randomized into an immediate 
x-ray referral group (n=73) or no immediate x-ray 
referral (control) group (n=80). Subjects were includ-
ed in the final analysis if they completed a question-
naire which included the back-pain specific Roland 
Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ), the Hospital 
Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the short 
form health survey SF-36 at the time of enrollment, 6 weeks and one year later (response rate at one year 
was 67%). In the RCT, those who had been immedi-
ately referred for radiography had no differences in 
physical functioning, pain, or disability compared to 
the control group. However, the subjects in the im-
mediate radiography group scored higher on psycho-
logical wellbeing at 6 weeks and one year compared to 
the control group. Similar findings were observed in 
the observational study in which, after adjusting for 
length of back pain episode at presentation, there were 
no differences in physical outcomes between groups. 
Those referred for x-ray had lower depression scores 
at six weeks and one year. The authors concluded that, 
unless patient anxiety is a major factor, it is not rec-
ommended to routinely refer for early x-ray for LBP 
as it is not associated with improvement of physical 
functioning, pain or disability. The work group down-
graded this potential Level I study due to poor fol-
low-up, significant crossover and potential bias. This 
study provides Level II evidence that, in the absence of 
red flags, x-ray does not provide additional benefit at 
initial consultation.
Future directions for Research
The work group recommends studies to evaluate the value of imaging (x-ray, CT 
or MRI) for patients with acute or chronic LBP in the absence of red flags.FLASK

QQImaging Question 6. Are there imaging findings that correlate with the presence of 
low back pain?
There is insufficient evidence for or against imaging findings correlating with the presence of 
low back pain.
 Grade of Recommendation: I  
Carragee et al1 investigated the association between 
new and serious LBP episodes with MRI findings of 
200 subjects in a 5-year prospective observational 
study. Working subjects with risk factors for degener-
ative lumbar disc disease but without a history of clin-
ical LBP episodes underwent a physical examination 
with plain radiographs, lumbar spine MRI and a de-
tailed interview at enrollment, 6 months and 5 years. 
The detailed interview included using a visual analog 
scale (VAS) for LBP intensity, Modified Oswestry Low 
Back Disability Questionnaire for subjective function-
al assessment and modified psychometric studies. If a 
new serious LBP episode with a rating scale intensity 
≥6 for ≥1 week was reported, MR imaging taken within 
6-12 weeks of the episode was compared with base-
line images. MR images were assessed by 2 indepen-
dent blinded examiners. Outcome measures includ-
ed MR findings (DD, annular disruption, herniation, 
moderate-severe endplate changes, spinal stenosis or 
neurologic compression, serious back pain episodes 
and occupation compensation or disability claims due 
to LBP. A total of 51 subjects had repeat scans avail-
able. The most common progressive findings were 
disc signal loss, facet arthrosis and endplate changes. 
Subjects having another MR were more likely to have 
had baseline psychological distress (OR 2.27, 95% 
CI 1.15-4.49). Radicular symptoms were the primary 
reason for three of the repeat scans. Only 2 subjects 
with primary radicular complaints had new findings 
of probable clinical significance. The authors con-
cluded that it was highly unlikely that new findings on 
MRI within 12 weeks of serious LBP represent any new 
structural change as many of the changes were relat-
ed to progressive age changes. The work group noted 
that although there was a subgroup analysis, the mix 
of back and radicular pain resulted in a small patient 
population with only LBP. Therefore, the work group 
downgraded this potential Level II study. This study 
provides Level III evidence that, in the setting of new 
back pain, MRI is highly unlikely to detect new struc-
tural disease and instead represents existing struc-
tural disease.Cho et al2 conducted a cross-sectional study to eval-
uate the prevalence and risk factors of LBP in mid-
dle-age and elderly residents of a rural community in 
South Korea. All participants were a part of the Korean 
Health and Genome cohort (aged 40-79 years). A total 
of 1,772 subjects had lumbar spine radiographs avail-
able. A single rheumatologist reviewed the radio-
graphs and graded the presence and severity of an-
terior osteophytes, endplate sclerosis and joint space 
narrowing using a reference atlas. Each vertebral 
level was graded using the Kellgren-Lawrence (K-L) 
grading system. Each subject completed a question-
naire that included information on lifestyle habits and 
self-report of LBP (current, past 6 months and life-
time) using the 7-item Guttman scale to classify pain 
intensity. Based on the results, the authors conclud-
ed that risk factors associated with either current or 
lifetime LBP included advanced age, female sex, time 
spent squatting, presence of osteophytes, joint space 
narrowing and advanced K-L grading; there was no 
association between presence of endplate sclerosis 
and LBP. This study provides Level III evidence that 
presence of disc space narrowing and osteophytes, 
but not presence of endplate sclerosis, correlates with 
LBP. 
Lakadamyali et al3 conducted a retrospective case 
control study to investigate the relationship between 
degenerative changes in posterior spinal elements 
and LBP, as well as to explore the age- and sex-re-
lated distribution of those changes on STIR sequence

and recorded presence of intervertebral DD, disc her-
niation, interspinous ligament degeneration or rup-
ture, facet joint effusion, neocyst formation, intrinsic 
spinal muscular degeneration and/or subcutaneous 
edema. Compared to patients without LBP, patients 
with LBP had higher incidences of facet joint effusion 
(p=0.0001), interspinous ligament edema (p=0.001 
for T12-L1; p=0.0001 for all lumbar levels), neocyst 
formation (p=0.0001) and intrinsic muscle degen-
eration (p=0.0001). The incidences of intervertebral 
DD, disc herniation, subcutaneous edema and muscle 
edema were similar in subjects with and without LBP, 
but increased with age in both groups. Relevant pos-
terior paraspinal changes were better visualized with 
STIR imaging than routine MRI. The authors conclud-
ed that the percentage of posterior paraspinal degen-
erative change findings was higher in subjects with 
LBP compared to those without LBP and that the use 
of the STIR sequence improved the visualization of 
those changes. This study provides Level III evidence 
that patients with LBP had significantly higher rates 
of facet joint effusion, interspinous ligament edema, 
neocyst formation and paraspinal muscle edema. The 
incidence of intervertebral DD, disc herniation and 
subcutaneous edema in persons with and without LBP 
were similar.
Liu et al4 conducted a prospective comparative and 
reliability study in order to develop and evaluate a 
quantitative assessment of the high-intensity zone 
(HIZ) on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in pa-
tients with LBP compared to those without LBP. A to-
tal of 72 patients (40 males, 32 females, aged 24-59 
years) with LBP for ≥ 6 months were enrolled into the 
symptomatic group (group A). All subjects underwent 
MRI scanning to confirm absence of potential non-
discogenic LBP sources. A total of 79 patients without 
LBP who presented to the hospital for routine health 
examinations or minor extremity injuries (44 males, 
35 females, aged 23-59 years) were enrolled into an 
asymptomatic control group (group B). All subjects 
underwent MR imaging. HIZ was recorded using Pic-
ture Archiving and Communication System (Jin YeX-
iang, Beijing, China). Blinded, experienced radiol-
ogists evaluated the images. The incidence of HIZ in 
symptomatic group A (45.8%) was significantly high-
er than asymptomatic group B (20.2%) (p=0.001). The 
intensity of the HIZ signal was significantly brighter 
in symptomatic group A (57.55 ± 14.04%) compared 
to asymptomatic group B (45.61 ±- 7.22%) (p=0.000). 
There were no significant differences in area of disc 
and HIZ nor the area ratio between group A and group 
B. The authors concluded that HIZ intensity is greater 
in subjects with LBP compared to those without LBP. In critique of the methodology, the work group down-
graded this potential Level II study as the study arm 
was retrospective rather than prospective. This study 
provides Level III evidence that HIZ intensity is great-
er in patients with LBP compared to controls. 
Maatta et al5 examined the relationship between Mod-
ic change (MC) and severe, disabling LBP along with 
features of DD in a longitudinal cohort study of twins. 
All subjects completed a comprehensive nurse-led 
questionnaire related to LBP and underwent lumbar 
MRI at baseline (n=823, 95.7% female) and after 10 
years (n=429, 98.1% female). A single blinded observ-
er evaluated all MR images to assess for MC and DD. 
A second reader evaluated a select subset of images 
to confirm acceptable inter-rater reliability. Subjects 
with severe and disabling LBP ≥ 1 month were more 
likely to have MC at baseline (subjects with MC: 35.0% 
vs. subjects without MC: 16.4%, p&lt;0.001) and at fol-
low-up (subjects with MC: 35.1% vs subjects without 
MC: 20.0%, p&lt;0.001). After adjusting for age, BMI, 
DD and Schmorl’s nodes (SN) at baseline, there was 
a significant association between severe, disabling 
LBP and MC (OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.04-2.41). The authors 
concluded that MC is an independent risk factor for 
episodes of severe and disabling LBP in middle-aged 
women. In critique of the methodology, the work-
group downgraded this potential Level III study due 
to poor follow-up. This study provides Level IV evi-
dence that Modic changes are associated with severe 
disabling back pain.
Riihimaki et al6 studied the relationship between LBP 
and lumbar spinal degeneration in concrete workers 
(n=216) and house painters (n=201). Each participant 
completed a self-administered questionnaire (related 
to occupation history, back accidents and smoking) 
and a physiotherapist-administered interview relat-
ed to back symptoms. Demographic information and 
lumbar radiographs were obtained. A radiologist re-
viewed the radiographs and recorded the presence of 
disc space narrowing, vertebral osteophytes (spondy-
lophytes) and endplate sclerosis for each of the lumbar 
intervertebral spaces using a graded system. Although 
there was a trend of increasing LBP with increased se-
verity of degeneration, there was no statistical signif-
icance. The authors concluded that there was an as-
sociation between moderate to severe degenerative 
changes and increased risk of sciatic pain. However, 
there were no significant correlations between these 
changes and occurrence of back pain. This study pro-
vides Level III evidence that degenerative changes on 
imaging were not associated with increased risk of the 
occurrence of  nonspecific LBP. Recommendations were developed based on a specific definition, inclusion/exclusion criteria, and the resulting literature which excluded conditions 
such as presence of a neurological deficit or leg pain experienced below the knee, among others. Given the exclusion criteria, these guideline rec-
ommendations address a subset of low back pain care as opposed to low back pain in its entirety. This clinical guideline is not intended to be a fixed 
treatment protocol; it is anticipated that there will be patients who require more or less treatment than what is outlined. This clinical guideline should 
not be construed as including all proper methods of care or excluding other acceptable methods of care reasonably directed to obtaining the same 
results. The ultimate judgment regarding any specific procedure or treatment is to be made by the physician and patient in light of all circumstances 
presented by the patient and the needs and resources particular to the locality or institution.

Teraguchi et al7 examined the associations between 
LBP and combinations of DD, endplate signal change 
(ESC) and Schmorl node (SN) in a cross-sectional 
study of 975 patients (324 men, 651 women, aged 21-
97 years) in Japan. Participants were recruited from 
the Research on Osteoarthritis/Osteoporosis against 
Disability (ROAD) cohort and included in this study af-
ter agreeing to a whole-spine MRI. T2-weighted im-
ages were obtained for all subjects used to assess DD, 
ESC and SN from L1-L2 to L5-S1. A board-certified or-
thopedic surgeon, who was blinded to the background 
of the participants, classified the degree of DD and the 
presence of ESC and/or SN. Kappa analysis to describe 
intraobserver and interobserver variability was com-
pleted for scoring of two orthopedic surgeons for DD, 
ESC and SN. LBP was diagnosed based on a standard-
ized question asked by board-certified orthopedic 
surgeons. The overall prevalence of DD alone (30.4%) 
was highest compared to ESC alone (0.8%), SN alone 
(1.5%), DD and ESC (26.6%), DD and SN (12.3%), SN 
and ESC (0.6%) and DD, ESC and SN (19.1%). A combi-
nation of DD, ESC and SN was significantly associated 
with LBP (OR 2.17, 95% CI 1.2-3.9; p&lt;0.01). Addition-
ally, significant associations with LBP were found in 
a combination of DD, ESC and SN at L1-L2 (OR 6.00, 
95% CI 1.9-26.6; p&lt;0.005), L4-L5 (OR 2.56, 95% CI 
1.4-4.9; p&lt;0.005) and L5-S1 (OR 2.85, 95% CI 1.1-2.3; 
p&lt;0.05) as well as a combination of DD and ESC at L3-
L4 (OR 2.43, 95% CI 1.5-4.0; p&lt;0.05), L4-L5 (OR 1.82, 95% CI 1.2-2.8; p&lt;0.01) and L5-S1 (OR 1.60, 95% CI 
1.1-2.3; p&lt;0.05). The authors concluded that although 
DD alone is not associated with LBP, a combination 
of DD and ESC, with or without SN, was significantly 
associated with LBP. Although there were some lim-
itations to the methodology as only T2 images were 
available, the work group did not find this sufficient 
reason to downgrade the study. This study provides 
Level II evidence that a combination of degenerative 
changes shows high correlation to LBP.
 
Wiikeri et al8 studied the relationship between lum-
bar DD and LBP in 295 Finnish concrete workers aged 
19-64 years. After each participant was radiological-
ly examined, a radiologist and an orthopedic surgeon 
evaluated each participant’s radiograph and graded 
lumbar DD as none, slight (12%), moderate (23%) or 
severe (9%). After adjusting for age, there was a weak 
association between history of LBP and DD (p&lt;0.01). 
There was also a weak association between history of 
sciatica and DD (p&lt;0.001). The authors concluded that 
there is a weak association between lumbar DD and 
LBP or sciatica, independent of age. This study pro-
vides Level IV evidence that lumbar degeneration has 
a weak correlation with LBP. 
Future directions for Research
The work group recommends separation between radicular pain and LBP 
groups, inclusion of an asymptomatic reference group and inclusion of a refer-
ence standard in a well-powered study.FLASK

QQImaging Question 7. Are there imaging findings that contribute to decision-making 
by health care providers to guide treatment? 
There is insufficient evidence to determine whether imaging findings contribute to decision-
making by health care providers to guide treatment.
 Grade of Recommendation: I  
Pneumaticos et al1 conducted a prospective random-
ized controlled trial to evaluate the use of bone scin-
tigraphy with single photon emission computed to-
mography (SPECT) in 47 adult patients (23 men and 
24 women) with low back pain who were referred 
for facet joint injection. The patients were random-
ized into group A or group B (with a ratio of 2:1 for 
patients in group A to group B). Bone scanning with 
SPECT was used for group A. If abnormalities were 
found, these patients were further categorized into 
group A1 (n=15) and injections were given at the lev-
el of the spine in which facet joint abnormalities were 
found on the scan. If no abnormalities were found, the 
patients were categorized into group A2 (n=16) and 
injections were given at the level originally indicated 
by the referring physician. Group B (n=16) underwent 
injections at the level originally indicated by the re-
ferring physician, without SPECT bone scanning. All participants completed a validated pain and function 
questionnaire before the injection and after 1, 3, and 
6 months. There was no significant difference be-
tween groups in average pain score at baseline. At one 
month, 87%, 13%, and 31% of patients in group A1, 
group A2, and group B, respectively, reported positive 
improvement in pain. The change in pain score was 
significantly higher in group A1 than group A2 and 
group B after one month and 3 months, but there was 
no difference after 6 months. The authors concluded 
that bone scintigraphy with SPECT can help identi-
fy patients with LBP who have been referred for facet 
joint injections. In critique of the methodology, the 
work group downgraded this potential Level I study 
due to a small sample size. Therefore, this study pro-
vides Level II evidence that bone scintigraphy with 
SPECT can help identify patients with LBP.
Future directions for Research
The work group recommends designing studies focused on the role of imaging 
in health care decision-making related specifically to LBP.FLASK

A systematic review of the literature yielded no studies to adequately address this question.
Future Directions for Research
The work group recommends further population-based observational studies 
that investigate the association between low back pain (LBP) and smoking. Spe-
cifically, a study comparing the frequency of LBP episodes between patients who 
have quit smoking and those who continue to smoke would be useful.FLASK

Antidepressants are not recommended for the treatment of low back pain
 Grade of Recommendation: A   
Atkinson et al2 conducted a double-blind random-
ized controlled trial with head-to-head comparison 
to evaluate the relative efficacy of noradrenergic and 
serotonergic antidepressants to treat chronic LBP in 
patients without depression. Participants aged 21-
65 years with chronic LBP ≥6 months who met study 
inclusion criteria were enrolled and randomized into 
groups using a stratified allocation scheme based on 
presence of radicular pain. Participants in the mapro-
tiline (n=33), paroxetine (n=34) and diphenhydr-
amine hydrochloride active placebo (n=36) groups 
were instructed to take a single capsule at the same 
time each day. Each drug dosage was increased ev-
ery 3 days as tolerated to the maximum range that is 
used for antidepressant dosage. Participants were in-
terviewed weekly to determine side effects. Pain in-
tensity using the Descriptor Differential Scale (DDS) 
and mood measures were obtained at enrollment and 
exit of the study. A total of 20, 22 and 32 participants 
in the maprotiline, paroxetine and placebo groups, 
respectively, completed the trial. Based on analyses 
of participants who completed the trial, the partici-
pants had an average pain intensity decrease of 45%, 
26% and 27% on maprotiline, paroxetine and place-
bo, respectively. The participants in the maprotiline 
group had significantly greater reduction in pain in-
tensity compared to paroxetine (p=0.013) and placebo 
(p=0.023). There was no difference in pain intensity reduction from paroxetine compared to placebo. Us-
ing an intent-to-treat analysis, pain intensity re-
duction was greater with maprotiline compared to 
paroxetine (p=0.028) but not compared to placebo 
(p=0.275). The most frequent adverse events reported 
were dry mouth, insomnia and sedation. The authors 
concluded that noradrenergic agents may be more 
effective analgesic agents than selective serotoner-
gic reuptake inhibitors. In critique of the methodol-
ogy, the work group downgraded this potential Level 
I study due to the rapid dose escalation and less than 
80% follow-up. This study provides Level II evidence 
that noradrenergic agents such as maprotiline are 
associated with greater reductions in LBP compared 
with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in non-
depressed patients with chronic LBP. 
Dickens et al3 conducted a randomized controlled trial 
to determine if paroxetine is more effective at reducing 
depression and pain than placebo. Patients with LBP 
(aged 18-65 years) were included in this study, given 
a placebo for 7 days and then randomized to receive 
either 20 mg paroxetine (n=44) or placebo (n=48) for 
the remainder of the study. Assessments were com-
pleted after 14, 28 and 56 days (±3 days each). At each 
assessment, measurements obtained included sever-
ity of depressive symptoms using MADRS, diagnosis 
of depression per DSM-III-R, pain intensity using a Muehlbacher et al1 studied the efficacy of topira-
mate for the treatment of chronic LBP in a random-
ized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Par-
ticipants with chronic LBP were recruited through 
advertisements and randomized into the topiramate 
group (n=48) or placebo group (n=48). Each partici-
pant completed the McGill pain Questionnaire (MPQ), 
State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory (STAXI), Os-
westry Low Back Pain Disability Questionnaire (OLB-
PQ) and and SF-36 Health Survey (SF-36) during a 
face-to-face interview at the time of enrollment and 
weekly for the duration of the study. After a one-week 
period in which participants were asked not to use an 
analgesic or anti-inflammatory medication, they re-
ceived daily study medication for 10 weeks. The par-
ticipants in the topiramate group received 50 mg of topiramate per day which was titrated at 50 mg/week 
to 300 mg/d by week 6 through week 10. Using an in-
tent-to-treat analysis, the participants in the topira-
mate group had significantly greater improvements 
in MPQ (p&lt;0.001), STAXI (p&lt;0.001), OLBPQ (p&lt;0.001) 
and and SF-36 (p&lt;0.001) compared to the partici-
pants in the placebo group. Adverse events such as 
severe somnolence, vision problems, psychomotor 
slowing, memory problems, dizziness, headache and 
paresthesia were reported, but there were no serious 
side effects reported. The authors concluded that the 
study drug is safe and effective in treating chronic 
LBP. This study provides Level I evidence that topira-
mate is more effective than placebo for the treatment 
of chronic LBP over 10 weeks.There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against the use of anticon-
vulsants for the treatment of low back pain.

100-mm Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and short-form of 
the McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ), disability using 
the Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Questionnaire 
(ODQ) and health cognitions using the Illness Attitude 
Scale (IAS). In an intention-to-treat analysis, there 
were no significant differences in depression symp-
toms (MADRS), pain intensity (VAS) or disability per 
Owestry Disability Index (ODI). However, subjects in 
the paroxetine group were more likely to reduce their 
intake of analgesia (n=4) compared to subjects in the 
placebo group (n=1). In an analysis of patients who 
took all pills as prescribed and attended all appoint-
ments, there were no significant differences between 
the placebo group (n=34) or paroxetine group (n=27) 
regarding depression, pain or disability. The authors 
concluded that paroxetine showed no effects on pain 
or depression compared to placebo. This study pro-
vides Level I evidence that treatment with paroxetine 
is no better than placebo at 56 days follow-up.
Goodkin et al4 assessed the efficacy of trazadone 
hydrochloride for the relief of LBP in a multicenter, 
randomized controlled trial. Adults with current LBP 
≥2 weeks which had either been continuous ≥1 year 
or with at least 2 prior LBP episodes ≥2 weeks were 
randomized to receive 50 mg trazadone (n=22) or 
placebo (n=20) tablets. Participants were instructed 
to start with one tablet per day and increase at inter-
vals of 3 days as tolerated to a maximum of 4 tablets 3 
times a day was reached. A 10-point VAS was used to 
rate pain every 12 hours at baseline; results were col-
lected at biweekly visits. Additionally, the Beck De-
pression Inventory (BDI) and Sickness Impact Profile 
(SIP) were used to assess depressed mood and daily 
life function, respectively. There were no significant 
differences in VAS scores between groups. Side ef-
fects of constipation, orthostatic hypotension, light-
headedness/dizziness, sedation/lethargy, dry mouth 
and confusion were reported more frequently in the 
trazadone group than placebo. The authors conclud-
ed that trazadone did not have any significant treat-ment effects in patients with LBP. This study provides 
Level II evidence that trazadone HCL is not more ef-
fective than placebo/no treatment for chronic LBP in 
the short-term study.
Skljarevski et al5 assessed the efficacy of duloxetine 
for the treatment of chronic LBP in a multicenter, 
double-blind, randomized controlled trial. Patients 
with LBP ≥6 months who met inclusion criteria were 
enrolled in a one-week screening phase. Eligible 
participants were then randomized, stratified by 
reported regular analgesic/NSAID usage, to receive 
a placebo (n=117) or duloxetine at 20 mg (n=59), 60 
mg (n=116), or 120 mg (n=112). During this 13-week 
treatment phase, participants recorded average 24-
hour pain ratings in a daily diary. A total of 267 (66.1%) 
of participants completed the study. The patients 
taking 60 mg duloxetine had significantly improved 
weekly pain from weeks 3 through 11, but not at weeks 
12 and 13. The patients receiving duloxetine 60 mg had 
significantly improved Patient’s Global Impressions 
of Improvement (PGI-I), 24-item Roland-Morris 
Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ), Brief Pain Inventory 
(BPI) average pain and BPI average interference. 
There were no significant differences between groups 
in occurrence of serious adverse events. Treatment-
emergent adverse events included nausea, insomnia, 
dry mouth, constipation, headache, diarrhea, 
dizziness, somnolence and fatigue. There were 
significantly more treatment-emergent adverse 
events in the 120 mg duloxetine group compared to 
the placebo. The authors concluded that duloxetine 
was superior to placebo for pain relief only from weeks 
3-11, but was superior to placebo for other secondary 
measures. In critique of the methodology, the work 
group downgraded the Level of evidence due to less 
than 80% follow-up. This study provides Level II 
evidence that duloxetine has no statistical benefit on 
pain or function in chronic LBP patients at 12 weeks. Diagnosis &amp; Treatment of Low Back Pain | Recommendations | Medical &amp; Psychological Treatment

There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against the use of Vitamin D for 
the treatment of low back pain
 Grade of Recommendation: I   
In a double-blind randomized clinical trial, Sandoughi 
et al6 studied the effect of vitamin D on LBP. Patients 
aged 18-40 years with chronic LBP &gt;3 months were 
recruited from a rheumatology clinic and randomized 
to receive either 50,000 IU vitamin D (n=26) or pla-
cebo (n=27) once a week for 8 weeks. All participants 
were encouraged to exercise at home and were given 
celecoxib to use as needed (up to 200 mg per day) for 
back pain. Severity of pain was assessed at baseline 
and after the 8-week trial using a VAS. At trial com-pletion, both groups had significant improvements in 
mean VAS scores and chronic pain with no significant 
differences between groups. There was no significant 
difference between groups for usage of celecoxib. The 
authors concluded that there were no significant dif-
ferences between vitamin D3 and placebo groups as 
both improved chronic LBP. This study provides Lev-
el II evidence that vitamin D is no more effective than 
placebo for treatment of chronic LBP.
Non-selective NSAIDs are suggested for the treatment of low back pain.

There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against the use of selective

 Grade of Recommendation: I   
Birbara et al7 conducted a double-blind, randomized, 
placebo-controlled trial across 46 centers in the 
United States. Adults with LBP for ≥3 months who 
regularly used an NSAID or acetaminophen for 30 
days prior to enrollment were included in this study. 
They were classified into two groups: LBP without 
radiation to the extremities or LBP with radiation 
to extremities but not below the knee and without 
neurological signs. At enrollment, each participant 
underwent a physical exam and completed the LBP 
intensity scale, low back pain bothersomeness scale, 
Patient Global Assessment of Disease Status (PGADS), 
Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ), 27 
Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and 
the Patient Health Survey (MOS Short Form [SF]-
12). If, after a 4-15 day washout period abstaining 
from their previous use of NSAID or acetaminophen, 
the patients had a LBP intensity scale score ≥40 mm 
which increased by at least 10 mm from baseline 
and a worsened PGADS score by at least 1 point, 
they remained enrolled. Patients were randomized 
into one of three groups: 90 mg dose of etoricoxib 
(n=107), 60 mg dose of etoricoxib (n=103), or placebo 
(n=109). They were instructed to take the study pill once daily and return after 1, 2, 4, 8 and 12 weeks to 
measure vital signs and undergo physical and safety 
assessments. The completion rates for the placebo, 
60 mg etoricoxib and 90 mg etoricoxib groups were 
59.6%, 72.8% and 67.3%, respectively. There were no 
significant differences in results between intent-to-
treat and per-protocol analyses. Compared to placebo, 
both etoricoxib groups had significant improvements 
in back pain intensity after 4 weeks (p≤0.001) and 12 
weeks (p≤0.05). Significantly different improvements 
in RMDQ, LBP bothersomeness scale, PGADS and 
patient and investigator-global assessment of 
response to therapy were also observed in both 
etoricoxib doses compared to placebo after 4 and 12 
weeks. There were no significant differences between 
reported clinical adverse events between the placebo 
(46.8%), 60 mg etoricoxib (58.3%) and 90 mg 
etoricoxib (52.3%) treatment groups. Compared to 
placebo group, the incidence of adverse events that the 
investigator judged as drug-related was high in the 90 
mg etoricoxib group, but not in the 60 mg etoricoxib 
group. The authors concluded that compared to 
placebo, etoricoxib once daily provided significant 
improvement in chronic LBP-related symptoms and  Diagnosis &amp; Treatment of Low Back Pain | Recommendations | Medical &amp; Psychological Treatment

disability after one week, with a maximal effect at 4 
weeks, for up to 3 months. This study provides Level I 
evidence that COX-2 inhibitors at two different doses 
have a mild effect on chronic LBP. However, this effect 
did not reach clinical significance as defined as 20 mm 
improvement on VAS.
Pallay et al8 evaluated the efficacy and safety of 
etoricoxib for LBP in a randomized multicenter, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Adults aged 
18-75 years with LBP &gt;3 months and regularly treated 
with NSAID or paracetamol for ≥30 days who met 
inclusion criteria were enrolled in this 12-week study 
across 46 outpatient centers. After a 4-25 day washout 
period of analgesic discontinuation, participants were 
randomized to take once-daily etoricoxib 60 mg 
(n=109), etoricoxib 90 mg (n=106), or placebo (n=110) 
using a double-dummy approach. Patients were 
evaluated and completed questionnaires at baseline 
and 1, 2, 4, 8 and 12 weeks postrandomization. 
Outcomes measured included LBP intensity 
using a 0-100 mm VAS, Roland-Morris Disability 
Questionnaire (RMDQ), LBP bothersomeness, patient 
global assessment of disease status and the Patient 
Health Survey (MOS Short Form [SF]-12). A total 
of 231 participants completed the study (77 in each 
group) with over 95% compliance in each group. An 
intention-to-treat analysis found the etoricoxib 60 
mg and 90 mg groups had significantly improved 
RMDQ scores at 12 weeks and decreased LBP intensity 
at 4 and 12 weeks compared to the control group. The 
per-protocol analysis was not significantly different. 
There were no significant differences in adverse 
events between groups. The authors concluded that 
etoricoxib provided relief in LBP symptoms and 
disability at 1 week, 4 weeks and 3 months. The work 
group downgraded this potential Level I study due 
to low follow-up rate, potential bias to responders 
to NSAIDS and no active comparator in this trial to 
compare against other NSAIDs. This study provides 
Level II evidence that etoricoxib can reduce chronic 
LBP better than placebo for up to three months.Dreiser et al9 conducted a multicenter, double-blind, 
double-dummy, randomized controlled trial to assess 
the safety and efficacy of diclofenac-K (12.5 mg tab-
let) compared to placebo and ibuprofen (200 mg) for 
acute LBP. Patients aged 18-60 years with acute LBP 
≥50 mm on a 100 mm VAS were randomized into a 
12.5 mg diclofenac-K group (n=124), 200 mg ibupro-
fen group (n=122), or placebo group (n=126). All par-
ticipants were instructed to follow a flexible multiple 
dosing regimen by taking 2 tablets initially, then 1-2 
tablets every 4-6 hours, not to exceed 6 tablets per 
day, while recording frequency of each dosage in a di-
ary. They were given the option to take a rescue med-
ication, paracetamol, which would terminate par-
ticipation in the trial. Each participant recorded pain 
(4-point scale) and pain relief (5-point scale) at 30 
minutes after initial trial drug and after each hour for 
6 hours. The End of First Dose (FD) global assessment 
of efficacy (5-point scale) was used to assess effica-
cy after 6 hours, time of rescue medication, or time of 
remedication. Participants completed a 100-mm VAS 
and the Eifel algofunctional questionnaire at base-
line and at the end of the 7-day trial. Compliance was 
measured using the diary entries and counting the 
medication left at the end of the trial. Intent-to-treat 
analysis was completed. Compared to patients in the 
placebo group, patients in the diclofenac-K group had 
significantly greater improvements in total pain relief 
over the first 3 and 6 hours as well as greater sum of 
pain intensity differences over 6 hours. Patients in the 
diclofenac-K group experiences greater pain intensi-
ty differences over the first 3 hours compared to both 
placebo and ibuprofen. Adverse events were similar in 
the diclofenac-K and ibuprofen groups, but higher in 
the placebo group. The most frequent adverse events 
were digestive reports; there were no serious adverse 
outcomes or deaths. The authors concluded that the 
flexible multiple dosing regimen of diclofenac-K 12.5 
mg is an effective and safe treatment for acute LBP. 
This paper provides Level I evidence that use of di-
clofenac in the treatment of acute LBP in the short-
term (one week) is safe and effective in the treatment 
of acute LBP for both pain and disability. Diagnosis &amp; Treatment of Low Back Pain | Recommendations | Medical &amp; Psychological Treatment

(n=39) or placebo (n=40). Pain was reported using the 
10-cm VAS upon ED arrival and discharge. Each pa-
tient was discharged home with 4 doses of the study 
medication (one dose per day). Five to 7 days after 
discharge, a phone interview was conducted to assess 
pain on a 3-point verbal rating scale (VRS). At 5 days, 
there was no statistically-significant difference in the 
3-point VRS for pain between groups. No significant 
side effects were reported during the follow-up tele-
phone call for either groups. The authors conclud-
ed that oral corticosteroids did not provide a benefit 
to ED patients with musculoskeletal LBP. This study 
provides Level II evidence that oral steroid (predni-
sone) is not more effective than placebo for acute LBP 
presenting to an emergency department.
Friedman et al11 conducted a double-blind randomized 
controlled trial to test the efficacy of intramuscular 
methylprednisolone acetate to treat nonradicular LBP 
one month after discharge from the emergency de-
partment (ED). Adults 21-50 years of age with a chief complaint of nontraumatic LBP upon presentation to 
the ED were enrolled if inclusion criteria were met af-
ter eligibility screening and interview. Only patents 
with a LBP etiology of twisting or lifting and who had 
a negative straight leg raise test were included. Par-
ticipants were randomized into the 160 mg methyl-
prednisolone acetate group (n=44) or placebo (n=43). 
After the attending physician completed individual-
ized treatment and back pain was controlled to a level 
acceptable for patient discharge, the subject received 
an injection of the study drug or placebo. Each par-
ticipant was discharged with a one-week supply of 
naproxen (500 mg), oxycodone 5 mg/acetamino-
phen 325 tablets, a detailed standardized instruction 
sheet. Subjects were called one week and one month 
after ED discharge and provided pain rating on an 
11-point numerical rating scale (NRS) and a 4-point 
descriptive scale. A total of 44 and 42 patients in the 
methylprednisolone and placebo groups were includ-
ed in final analysis. There were no differences in NRS 
scores between groups at one week or one month. The 
authors concluded that parenteral corticosteroids did 
not provide any benefit for treatment of nonradicular 
LBP in patients in the ED. This study provides Level 
II evidence that intravenous steroids are not more ef-
fective than placebo for acute LBP presenting to the 
emergency department.
It is suggested that the use of opioid pain medications should be cautiously limited and restrict -
ed to short duration for the treatment of low back pain. 
 Grade of Recommendation: B   
Work Group Narrative: There are limited data that support the short-term effectiveness of opioid pain medication for 
low back pain. There remain concerns in study design including the role of enriched enrollment and high dropout rates 
in these trials. The trials also report high rates of adverse events, which may factor into the high dropout rates. As there 
are few studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of opioids for low back pain beyond 12 weeks and given the con-
cerns associated with the use of opioids with the availability of other effective pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic 
treatment options, we recommend the cautious use of opioid pain medication in those with low back pain and, when 
utilized, that a short duration is recommended. Diagnosis &amp; Treatment of Low Back Pain | Recommendations | Medical &amp; Psychological Treatment
Recommendations were developed based on a specific definition, inclusion/exclusion criteria, and the resulting literature which excluded conditions 
such as presence of a neurological deficit or leg pain experienced below the knee, among others. Given the exclusion criteria, these guideline rec-
ommendations address a subset of low back pain care as opposed to low back pain in its entirety. This clinical guideline is not intended to be a fixed 
treatment protocol; it is anticipated that there will be patients who require more or less treatment than what is outlined. This clinical guideline should 
not be construed as including all proper methods of care or excluding other acceptable methods of care reasonably directed to obtaining the same 
results. The ultimate judgment regarding any specific procedure or treatment is to be made by the physician and patient in light of all circumstances 
presented by the patient and the needs and resources particular to the locality or institution.75
Buynak et al12 conducted a multicenter, double-blind, 
randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy 
and safety of tapentadol extended relief (ER) for the 
treatment of moderate to severe chronic LBP. Adults 
with LBP ≥ 3 months with a pain intensity ≥ 5 out of 
11 on a numerical rating scale (NRS) were enrolled 
in this study. Participants were randomized into 
the 100-250 mg BID tapentadol ER group (n=321), 
20-50 mg BID oxycodone HCl controlled release 
(CR) group (n=334), or BID placebo group (n=326) 
and underwent a screening and washout period. 
During a 3-week double-blind titration period, doses 
were increased every 3 days, as tolerated, with the 
assistance of a physician to reach optimal pain relief. 
Participants were instructed to maintain a steady 
dose for the duration of the 12-week maintenance 
trial period if possible. The mean pain intensity was 
measured using an 11-point NRS throughout the 
maintenance period and at week 12. A total of 52.2%, 
40.5% and 47.6%, of participants completed the 
study in the tapentadol ER, oxycodone CR and placebo 
groups, respectively. An intent-to-treat analysis was 
completed on participants who received at least one 
dose of their assigned medication in the tapentadol 
(n=315), oxycodone HCl (n=326), or placebo (n=317) 
groups. There was a significant reduction in mean 
pain intensity with tapentadol compared to placebo 
(least square mean difference vs placebo [95% 
confidence interval {CI}] -0.8, [-1.22 to -0.47]) at 
week 12. There was also a significant reduction in 
mean pain intensity with oxycodone CR compared 
to placebo (least square mean difference vs. placebo 
[95%CI], -0.9 [-1.24 to -0.49]) at week 12. Mean pain 
intensity was significantly reduced throughout the 
overall maintenance period for both tapentadol ER 
compared to placebo and oxycodone HCl compared 
to placebo. The most common adverse events 
reported in the treatment groups included nausea, 
constipation, headache, vomiting, dizziness, pruritus 
and somnolence. Compared to the tapentadol group, 
the oxycodone HCl group had approximately double 
the incidence of vomiting, constipation and pruritus 
as well as higher odds of experiencing constipation 
or nausea and/or vomiting (p&lt;0.001). Serious adverse 
events were reported in the placebo group (0.9%), 
tapentadol ER group (2.2%) and oxycodone CR 
group (3.4%). Serious adverse events likely related to 
either of the study drugs included decreased level of 
consciousness, mental confusion, atrial fibrillation, 
dizziness and dehydration.The authors concluded 
that tapentadol ER was effective for relief of moderate 
to severe chronic LBP over 15 weeks. In critique of 
the methodology, the work group downgraded this 
potential Level I article due to less than 80% follow-up. This study provides Level II evidence that tapentadol 
improved pain, sleep and physical functioning (BPI 
scores in patients with chronic LBP compared to 
placebo and similar to oxycodone CR with improved 
tolerability [gastrointestinal side effects]). 
Cloutier et al13 conducted a double-blind randomized 
controlled trial to study the efficacy and safety of con-
trolled release (CR) oxycodone/CR naloxone for the 
treatment of chronic LBP. Adults with chronic LBP ≥ 
3 months with a pain intensity of ≥2 out of a 5-point 
ordinal scale were enrolled in this study and com-
pleted a 2-7 day washout period from period opioid 
analgesics. Participants were randomly assigned to 
the study treatment group to receive CR oxycodone/
CR naloxone (n=39) or placebo (n=44). Patients at-
tended weekly clinic visits in which the dosage was 
titrated to the maximum effect with acceptable side 
effects and maintained that dosage for 4 weeks. After 
4 weeks, they received the initial dose again and re-
peated the same titration period. The 5-point ordinal 
scale and 100 mm VAS were used to measure pain two 
times a day in a daily diary. A per-protocol analysis 
was completed for patients who completed at least 2 
weeks in each phase while following protocol (n=54, 
65%). Per the per-protocol analysis, the CR oxyco-
done/CR naloxone group had a significantly greater 
reduction in mean VAS (p=0.0296) and ordinal pain 
scores (p=0.0415) compared to placebo. An intent-to-
treat analysis was conducted for participants who had 
at least one dose and at least one post-randomization 
data point (n=83). Compared to the placebo group, 
the CR oxycodone/CR naloxone group had lower, but 
with no statistical significance, VAS and 5-point ordi-
nal pain scale. There were four serious adverse events 
during the trail, which were all deemed “not related 
to study medication.” Other adverse events report-
ed included nausea, constipation, diarrhea, fatigue, 
somnolence, vomiting, dizziness, dry mouth, upper 
respiratory tract infection and abdominal pain. There 
was no difference in the incidence of adverse events 
between groups. The authors concluded that CR oxy-
codone/CR naloxone was effective for treatment of 
moderate to severe chronic LBP in patients who com-
plied with the protocol. In critique of the methodol-
ogy, the work group downgraded this potential Level 
I article due to small sample size and less than 80% 
follow-up. This study provides Level II evidence that 
opioids help pain control for chronic LBP versus pla-
cebo.

ery system (OROS) hydromorphone extended release 
(ER) in the treatment of moderate to severe chronic 
LBP in opioid-tolerant patients. After a screening pe-
riod of &lt;2 weeks, 459 patients with chronic LBP un-
derwent a 2-4 week conversion and titration phase in 
which they received a dose of hydromorphone ER that 
was approximately 75% of their previous total daily 
opioid dose. If they met inclusion criteria, they were 
then randomized into the hydromorphone ER group 
(n=134) or placebo group (n=134) and entered the 12-
week double-blind treatment phase. The hydromor-
phone ER group continued to take a fixed dose for the 
duration of the treatment phase. The placebo group 
received gradually-reduced doses of hydromorphone 
ER over 14 days and received placebo only for the du-
ration of the treatment phase. Patients recorded their 
pain rating using a 10-point numerical rating system 
(NRS) in a daily diary. Patients were asked to bring 
their diaries to each follow-up visit. Staff also called 
patients to monitor safety and compliance in between 
visits. A total of 49.6% and 33.1% of participants in the 
hydromorphone ER and placebo group, respectively, 
completed the 12-week treatment trial. A total of 266 
patients were included in the intent-to-treat analy-
sis of the hydromorphone group (n=133) and placebo 
group (n=133). Over the 12-week treatment phase, the 
hydromorphone ER group had significantly reduced 
pain intensity (p&lt;0.001), change in weekly patient di-
ary NRS scores (p&lt;0.001) and change in office visit NRS 
scores (p&lt;0.05) compared to placebo. The hydromor-
phone group had a significantly higher proportion of 
participants (60.6%) who reported at least 30% pain 
reduction compared to placebo (42.9%). A total of 43 
(32.1%) in the placebo group and 36 (26.9%) in the 
hydromorphone ER group of the double-blind phase 
reported adverse events that were considered likely to 
be related to the study medication in the double-blind 
phase. Adverse events including constipation, sinus-
itis and arthralgia were reported at a higher rate in the 
hydromorphone ER group compared to placebo. The 
authors concluded that hydromorphone ER was safe 
and effective in opioid-tolerant patients with mod-
erate to severe LBP. In critique of the methodology, 
the workgroup downgraded the level of evidence of 
this potential Level I study due to the high drop-out 
rate, less than 80% follow-up and no validated out-
come measures. This study provides Level II evidence 
that once daily oral hydromorphone ER is more effec-
tive than placebo in opioid-experienced patients with 
chronic lower back pain for up to three months in a 
randomized withdrawal protocol which tapered both 
long acting and short acting (rescue opioids) in the 
placebo group. Functional improvements were noted 
in the treatment arm per RMDQ.Lasko et al15 conducted a double-blind, multicenter, 
randomized controlled trial to assess the safety and 
efficacy of an extended-release combination for-
mulation of 75mg tramadol and 650mg paracetamol 
(DDS-06C) compared to placebo for treatment of LBP. 
Patients aged 18-80 years with LBP rated as at least 
2 out of 4 and 2 out of 11 on intensity rating scales 
were included in this phase III study. Patients were 
randomized into DDS-06C (n=141) or placebo group 
(n=136) and instructed to take 1-2 tablets of the study 
pill every 10-12 hours for 2.5 hours. They rated their 
pain intensity (4-point scale) and pain relief (5-point 
scale) at 0.5 h, 1 h, 1.5 h, 2 h, 4 h, 6 h (±30 min), 26 h 
(±30 min), 30 h (±30 min), 34 h (±30 min) and 50 h 
(±30 min). If patients required ongoing treatment at 
the day 3 follow-up visit, they continued to receive the 
open-label DDS-06C for 2.5 more days (n=219). Com-
pared to the subjects in the placebo group, the sub-
jects in the DDS-06C group had a significantly greater 
decrease in pain intensity (p=0.038) and greater pain 
relief (p=0.026) during the 50 hour observation peri-
od. Adverse events were reported by both the placebo 
(2.2%) and DDS-06C group (12.1%). Most of the ad-
verse events were mild-to-moderate and considered 
to be at least possibly related to the treatment. There 
was one serious adverse event (hospitalization due to 
exacerbation of back pain) but it was deemed not re-
lated to the study medication. The authors concluded 
that the study drug was superior to placebo for relief 
of LBP and intensity. This paper provides Level I evi-
dence that tramadol/paracetamol ER can reduce acute 
LBP better than placebo in the short-term (50 hours).
Lee et al16 studied the efficacy and safety of trama-
dol hydrochloride 75-mg/acetaminophen 650-mg 
extended release tablets (TA-ER) for the treatment 
of chronic LBP. Adults aged 25-75 years with mod-
erate to severe chronic LBP who met inclusion crite-
ria were enrolled in this multicenter, double-blind, 
randomized controlled trial. After a 7-day screening 
period, participants were randomized into the TA-ER 
group (n=125) or placebo group (n=120) and began a 
4-week trial which included a 7-day dose-titration 
phase. Patients attended regularly-scheduled fol-
low-up visits and rated their average pain intensity 
using a 6-point VAS, quality of life using the Korean 
Short Form-36 (K-SF-36) and functionality using 
the Korean Oswestry Disability Index (K-ODI). A to-
tal of 104 and 92 patients in the placebo and TA-ER 
group, respectively, completed this study. In the full 
analysis set and the per-protocol analysis, the TA-ER 
group had a significantly higher percentage of patents 
with a pain intensity change rate ≥30% compared to 
the placebo group (p&lt;0.05). The patients in the TA-ER  Diagnosis &amp; Treatment of Low Back Pain | Recommendations | Medical &amp; Psychological Treatment

group also had significantly higher pain relief at days 
8 and 15, improved general health and higher func-
tional improvements compared to the placebo group. 
Adverse events were reported more frequently in the 
TA-ER group compared to the placebo group. No se-
rious adverse events that were believed to be related 
to the study drug occurred. The authors concluded 
that TA-ER was safe and effective in treating chronic 
LBP. In critique of the methodology, the work group 
downgraded the level of evidence of this potential 
Level I article due to the short follow-up period and 
non-stratification of the patients. This paper provides 
Level II evidence that short-term relief is better with 
ER tramadol/acetaminophen than no treatment in 
patients with chronic LBP. 
Peloso et al17 conducted a multicenter, double-blind, 
randomized, placebo-controlled trial to study the ef-
ficacy of tramadol 37.5 mg/acetaminophen 325 mg 
(tramadol/APAP) for the treatment of LBP. Adults 
with LBP requiring daily medication &gt; 3 months but 
otherwise generally healthy were enrolled, complet-
ed a washout phase of all pain medication for up to 
21 days, were randomized to receive tramadol/APA 
(n=167) or placebo (n=169) and completed a titration 
phase. Patients were evaluated and reported pain us-
ing a 100 mm VAS, Short-Form McGill Pain Question-
naire (SFMPQ), Roland Morris Disability Question-
naire (RMDQ), Medical Outcome Study Short Form-36 
(SF-36) Health Survey and overall medication assess-
ments on days 1, 14, 28, 56 and 91. Patients were given 
instructions regarding the use of rescue medications 
and were allowed to maintain physiotherapy if it was 
started prior to the double-blind portion of the study. 
A total of 86 and 61 participants completed the study 
in the tramadol/APAP and placebo groups, respec-
tively. Intention-to-treat analysis found that the par-
ticipants in the tramadol/APA group had significantly 
better mean pain VAS, pain relief, RMDQ and SF-36 
scores compared to the placebo group. Common ad-
verse events included nausea, dizziness, constipation 
and somnolence, but there were no serious adverse 
events thought to be related to the study medication. 
The authors concluded that the study drug had similar 
tolerability as other opioids and was effective in pain 
reduction, physical functioning and quality of life for 
the treatment of LBP. The work group downgraded 
the level of evidence due to less than 80% follow-up 
and other critique of the methodology such as un-
certainty regarding blinding, patients may have had 
other interventions, and pain patients were a selected 
group with various exclusion criteria. Therefore, this 
study provides Level II evidence that tramadol/acet-
aminophen provides better pain relief and functional improvement than placebo for up to three months.
Ruoff et al18 assessed the efficacy and safety of tra-
madol 37.5 mg/acetaminophen 325 mg (tramadol/
APAP) for the treatment of LBP in a multicenter, ran-
domized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Pa-
tients aged 25-75 years with chronic LBP requiring 
daily pain medication≥3 months who met inclusion 
criteria were enrolled. Eligible patients completed a 
3-week screening and washout period and were then 
randomized to receive tramadol/APA or placebo. Af-
ter a 10-day titration period, participants received up 
to 8 tablets per day. Patients reported their pain us-
ing a 100 mm and completed the Pain Relief Rating 
Scale (PRRS), Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire 
(SF-MPQ), Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire 
(RMDQ), 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) 
and overall medication assessment at various time 
points from day 1-91. A total of 161 and 157 partici-
pants were included in the intention-to-treat analy-
sis in the tramadol/APAP and placebo groups, respec-
tively. A total of 91 and 74 participants completed the 
treatment in its entirety in the tramadol/APAP and 
placebo groups, respectively. Compared to the place-
bo group, the tramadol/APAP group had significant-
ly favorable final mean PVA scores (p=0.015), PRRS 
scores (p&lt;0.001), SF-MPQ improvements (p=0.021), 
RMDQ score improvements (p&lt;0.027) and SF-36 sub-
category improvements. Adverse events thought to 
be related to treatment medication included nausea, 
somnolence and constipation; there were no treat-
ment-related serious adverse events. The authors 
concluded that tramadol/APAP was effective for the 
treatment of chronic LBP and had a favorable safe-
ty profile. This study provides Level II evidence that 
tramadol/acetaminophen is better than placebo for 
chronic LBP for up to 3 months.
Schiphorst et al19 conducted a randomized controlled 
trial to evaluate the efficacy of tramadol/acetamino-
phen in patients with chronic LBP. Adult patients with 
chronic LBP &gt;3 months on a wait list for a rehabili-
tation program were randomized to receive tramadol 
37.5 mg/acetaminophen 325 mg capsules (n=25) or 
placebo (n=25). All participants conducted a wash-out 
period up to 7 days before beginning a one-week ti-
tration phase followed by a steady dose for at least one 
week. Functional capacity, pain intensity and self-re-
ported disability per the Roland Morris Disability 
Questionnaire (RMDQ) were measured at baseline and 
at completion of the two-week trial. One patient in the 
treatment group was lost to follow-up; a total of 49 
patients were included in final analysis. There were no 
significant differences in outcome measures between  Diagnosis &amp; Treatment of Low Back Pain | Recommendations | Medical &amp; Psychological Treatment

groups. One subgroup (n=10) reported improvements 
in RMDQ and global pain relief. Side effects such as 
dizziness, nausea, tiredness, diarrhea and skin rash 
were reported in both the placebo group (24%) and 
treatment group (88%). The authors concluded that 
there were only small nonsignificant treatment ef-
fects with tramadol/acetaminophen. The workgroup 
downgraded the level of evidence from Level I to Level 
II due to the small sample study, no power analysis, 
short follow-up and limited generalizability of this 
exploratory study. This study provides Level II evi-
dence that tramadol/acetaminophen provided simi-
lar outcomes to placebo in measures of function in a 
2-week study.
Schnitzer et al20 evaluated the efficacy and safety of 
tramadol for treatment of moderate chronic LBP in a 
two-part trial at 26 centers in the United States. Eligi-
ble patients aged 25-75 with LBP requiring daily med-
ication ≥3 months who met inclusion criteria were 
enrolled in a screening and washout phase for up to 
3 weeks. Patients with at least moderate LBP (n=380) 
then entered a 3-week open-label phase in which they 
initially received 50 mg tramadol/day which increased 
to at least 200 mg/day (maximum 400 mg/day) by 
day 14. If patients tolerated and perceived benefit 
during the open-label phase, they were enrolled in 
the 4-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-con-
trolled phase. These participants were randomized to 
receive tramadol 200-400 mg/day (n=127) or placebo 
(n=127) with no rescue medication. Patients were in-structed to continue their current level of exercise but 
not to initiate any new physiotherapy during the trial. 
Participants recorded pain according to a 10-cm VAS, 
pain relief per the pain relief rating scale, LBP details 
per the short form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-
MPQ), quality of life per the Roland Morris Disability 
Questionnaire (RMDQ). Patients were considered to 
have “therapeutic failure” if they did not experience 
pain relief for any 24-hour period. A total of 91 and 
55 patients completed the entire trial in the tramadol 
and placebo group, respectively. The time to ther-
apeutic failure was significantly different between 
groups. The participants in the tramadol group also 
experienced significantly lower mean pain VAS scores 
and significantly better SF-MPQ and RMDQ scores. 
Common adverse events included nausea, dizziness, 
somnolence and headache. Seventy-eight of the 380 
participants in the open-label period discontinued 
treatment due to adverse events, but &lt;10% experi-
enced each adverse event in the double-blind phase. 
Four participants in the tramadol group experienced 
serious adverse events that were deemed possibly or 
unlikely related to the treatment drug (ie, myocardial 
infarction, myocardial ischemia, prostate cancer and 
depression). The authors concluded tramadol was ef-
fective for the treatment of chronic LBP in patients 
who tolerate it well. This study provides Level II ev-
idence that tramadol is better than no treatment at 
reducing chronic LBP up to 45 days in tramadol re-
sponders.
Future Directions for Research
The work group recommends development of studies that identify specific 
groups of patients who respond to a particular opioid medication with minimal 
dependence risk.FLASK

QQMed/Psych Question 3. In patients with low back pain, is topical treatment (eg, 
cream or gel) effective in decreasing duration of pain, decreasing intensity of pain, 
increasing functional outcomes of treatment and improving the return-to-work 
rate? 
There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against the use of lidocaine 
patch for the treatment of low back pain.
 Grade of Recommendation: I  
Gimbel et al1 assessed the effectiveness and safe-
ty of 5% lidocaine patch for the treatment of LBP in 
an open-label pilot study. Patients with LBP from 5 
different centers in the United States were catego-
rized into groups upon enrollment based on duration of LBP: acute/subacute (3 months), n=21; short-term 
chronic (3-12 months), n=33; or long-term chron-
ic (12 months), n=77. Participants applied the lido-
caine patch to the area of LBP up to 4 times daily for 
6 weeks. After 2 weeks, patients were allowed to taper  Diagnosis &amp; Treatment of Low Back Pain | Recommendations | Medical &amp; Psychological Treatment

treatment protocol; it is anticipated that there will be patients who require more or less treatment than what is outlined. This clinical guideline should 
not be construed as including all proper methods of care or excluding other acceptable methods of care reasonably directed to obtaining the same

headache. There were no drug-related serious adverse 
events reported. The authors concluded that the lido-
caine patch 5% resulted in significant improvements 
in pain intensity and QOL and randomized controlled 
trials are warranted to further investigate its efficacy 
and safety for the treatment of LBP. This study pro-
vides Level III evidence that treatment with lidocaine 
patch 5% provided a significant improvement in pain 
intensity and QOL.
Topical capsicum is recommended as an effective treatment for low back pain on a short-term 
basis (3 months or less).
 Grade of Recommendation: A   
Frerick et al2 conducted a double-blind, randomized, 
placebo-controlled multicenter study to assess the ef-
ficacy and tolerance of capsicum plaster for the treat-
ment of LBP. A total of 320 patients were random-
ized to the treatment group which received a 12 x 18 
cm capsicum plaster (n=160) or placebo group which 
received a similar plaster with no active medication 
(n=160). All participants were instructed to apply the 
plaster to the site of pain for 4-8 hours once daily for 
21 days. The Arhus Low Back Rating Scale was used to 
record patient-reported pain, disability and physical 
impairment at baseline and days 7 and 21. The glob-
al assessments of efficacy by patient and investiga-
tor were also recorded at baseline and days 7 and 21. 
An intent-to-treat analysis included 319 participants 
(159 in the treatment group and 160 in the placebo 
group). The treatment group experienced significant-
ly greater reduction in pain (42%) compared to the 
placebo group (31%). The responder rate (≥30% pain 
reduction) was greater in the treatment group (67%) 
compared to the placebo group (49%). A total of 120 
and 129 participants completed the study in the treat-
ment group and placebo group, respectively and were 
included in the per-protocol analysis. Per-protocol 
analysis supported the intention-to-treat analysis. 
Adverse events likely related to capsicum included 
excessively severe sensation of heat or erythema. The 
authors concluded that capsicum plasters may offer 
an alternative treatment for LBP. This study provides 
Level I evidence that capsicum plaster applied topi-cally may have short-term benefit for patients with 
back pain persisting for more than 3 months.
Keitel et al3 studied the efficacy of capsicum plaster for 
the treatment of LBP in a double-blind randomized 
controlled study. A total of 154 participants were 
randomized to receive a capsicum plaster or placebo 
plaster. Participants placed the plaster at the site of 
pain for 4-12 hours once daily for 21 days. The Arhus 
Low Back Rating Scale was used to measure pain and 
impairment of movement. The global assessments of 
efficacy and tolerance by participant and physician 
were recorded at baseline and follow-up. A total of 
76 participants in the placebo group and 74 patients 
in the capsicum group were included in intention-
to-treat analysis. The responder rate (≥30% pain 
reduction) was significantly greater in the capsicum 
group (60.8%) compared to the control group (42.1%). 
The participants in the capsicum group experienced 
significantly greater reduction in the sum of 3 separate 
pain scores compared to the placebo group. Common 
adverse events included local sensation of warmth 
and itching; more adverse reactions were reported in 
the treatment group compared to the placebo group. 
The authors concluded that capsicum plaster can be 
used in chronic nonspecific LBP. This study provides 
Level I evidence that capsicum plaster provided more 
analgesia than placebo in a 3-week trial of patients 
with  nonspecific LBP.off existing analgesic drugs and increase daily lido-
caine patches if pain was unacceptable during the ta-
per period. Patients completed the BPI to report pain 
and quality of life (QOL) at baseline, 2 weeks and 6 
weeks. At 2 and 6 weeks, each group had significantly 
improved pain scores compared to baseline (p≤0.001). 
Improvements in QOL were observed in each group 
from baseline to 2 and 6 weeks. Adverse events re-
ported included skin reactions, lightheadedness and

QQMed/Psych Question 4. Following treatment for low back pain, do patients with 
healthy sleep habits experience decreased duration of pain, decreased intensity of 
pain, increased functional outcomes and improved return-to-work rates compared 
to patients with poor sleeping habits? 
A systematic review of the literature yielded no studies to adequately address this question.
Future Directions for Research
The work group recommends high quality, prospective studies that utilize sleep 
logs or other tracking methodologies to evaluate low back treatment outcomes 
in patients with and without healthy sleep habits.FLASK
QQMed/Psych Question 5. In patients with low back pain, is cognitive behavioral 
therapy (CBT) and/or psychosocial intervention and/or neuroscience education 
effective in decreasing duration of pain, decreasing intensity of pain, increasing 
functional outcomes, decreasing anxiety and/or depression and improving return-
to-work rate? 
Cognitive behavioral therapy is recommended in combination with physical therapy, as com-
pared with physical therapy alone, to improve pain levels in patients with low back pain over 12 
months.
 Grade of Recommendation: A  
Cognitive behavioral therapy in combination with physical therapy, compared to physical thera-
py alone, is suggested to improve functional outcomes (disability) and return to work in patients 
with low back pain.
 Grade of Recommendation: B  
There is conflicting evidence to make a recommendation for or against cognitive behavioral 
therapy for improving depression or anxiety in patients with low back pain.

Bendix et al1 compared the rehabilitation outcomes 
from 3 different therapy approaches to treat LBP in 
prospective randomized study. A total of 132 patients 
were randomized into one of 3 groups. Group 1 (n=46) 
received an intensive multidisciplinary rehabilita-
tion program 39 hours per week for 3 weeks plus an 
additional 6-hour follow-up session once a week for 
the following 3 weeks (total of 135 hours). Group 2 
(n=43) received active physical training of aerobics, 
weight training and back education twice weekly for 
6 weeks (total of 24 hours). Group 3 (n=43) received 
a combined psychological and physical therapy pro-
gram twice weekly for 6 weeks (total of 24 hours). Re-
habilitation outcomes such as return-to-work rate, 
days of sick leave, health-care contacts, pain and dis-
ability score and staying physically active were mea-
sured at baseline and 4 months after therapy. After 4 
months, 40, 31 and 35 patients in Group 1, Group 2 and 
Group 3, respectively, were available for follow-up. 
Compared to the participants in Group 2 and Group 
3, the participants in Group 1 had significantly im-
proved work-readiness (p=0.01), health care contacts 
(p=0.05), pain (p≤0.001), disability (p=0.002) and 
self-reported physical activity (p=0.005). The authors 
concluded that the multidisciplinary program may be 
more expensive than a less-intensive program, but is 
overall economically worthwhile due to savings in sick 
pay, health care contacts and early retirement pen-
sions. Of note, when psychological interventions were 
combined with physical training there was an im-
provement in outcomes related to LBP but the nature 
of this question did not address physical and psych 
training together. The work group determined that 
this study provides Level I evidence that psychological 
training programs in addition to physical training do 
not improve functional outcomes compared to physi-
cal training alone with regard to LBP.
Dufour et al2 studied the efficacies of a group-based 
multidisciplinary biopsychosocial rehabilitation pro-
gram and an individual intensive therapist-assisted 
back muscle exercise program. In this randomized 
controlled trial, patients with chronic LBP &gt;12 weeks 
were stratified and randomly allocated into the mul-
tidisciplinary biopsychosocial rehabilitation program 
(group A) or the individual exercise program (group 
B). Each group program ran for 12 weeks. Group A 
(n=129) received biweekly education from a phys-
iotherapist and occupational therapist along with a 
total of 75 hours of moderate muscle training exer-
cise which included warm up, stretching, aerobic ex-
ercises, strengthening exercises, playing ball games, 
training in hot water and ball stick training. Group B 
(n=143) received intensive muscle training exercises, without stretching or abdominal exercises, guided by 
a therapist for a total of 22 hours of exercise. Through-
out the program, each patient received a total of 12 
and 24 hours of therapist assistance in Group A and 
Group B, respectively. Outcomes were measured at 
baseline, after 3 months of treatment and at 6, 12 and 
24 months. Pain per the VAS, disability per the Ro-
land-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ), most 
of the MOS Short-Form Health Survey results and 
ability to work significantly improved in both groups 
after treatment using an intent-to-treat analysis as 
well as an analysis of actual data. There were some 
minor statistically-significant (but not clinically sig-
nificant) differences in improvement between groups. 
A total of 11 patients in each group dropped out due 
to adverse events such as requirement of surgery, 
concussion, leg pain, delayed onset muscle sore-
ness, or other reasons unrelated to treatment. The 
authors concluded that both groups had significantly 
improved long-term pain and disability scores. This 
study provides Level I evidence that a biopsychosocial 
program plus physical training is as effective as an in-
tensive physical exercise program for chronic LBP.
Lamb et al3 conducted a multicenter randomized con-
trolled trial to compare the clinical and cost-effec-
tiveness of active management with a cognitive-be-
havioral approach (CBA) versus active management 
alone (AM) in patients with LBP. Patients with sub-
acute or chronic LBP from 56 different clinical prac-
tices in English regions were randomized into either 
the CBA (n=468) or AM (n=233) group. Both groups 
received a 15-minute standard best-practice inter-
vention, which included distribution of an education-
al back book. The CBA group additionally attended 6 
professionally led group sessions that covered goal 
setting, pacing, challenging beliefs, managing pain 
and improving communication with health profes-
sionals. Patients were asked to provide demograph-
ic, LBP-associated disability information per the 
Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ) and 
pain and disability information per the Modified Von 
Korff Scale (MVK) through postal questionnaires or 
telephone surveys (85% follow-up at 12 months). 
The CBA group experienced significantly greater im-
provements in mean RMDQ scores at 3 (1.1; 95% CI 0.4 
to 1.7), 6 (1.4; 95% CI, 0.7 to 2.1) and 12 months (1.3; 
95% CI 0.6 to 2.1). Significantly greater improvements 
in the CBA group compared to the AM group were also 
seen in pain per the MVK at 3 (6.8; 95% CI 3.5 to 10.2), 
6 (8.0; 95% CI 4.3 to 11.7) and 12 months (7.0; 95% CI 
3.2 to 10.7) as well as disability per the MVK at 3 (4.3; 
95% CI 0.4 to 12.4), 6 (8.1; 95% CI 4,1 to 12.0) and 12 
months (8.4; 95% CO 4.4 to 12.4). The authors con- Diagnosis &amp; Treatment of Low Back Pain | Recommendations | Medical &amp; Psychological Treatment

cluded that CBA showed long-term effectiveness in 
treating patients with subacute and chronic LBP. This 
study provides Level I evidence that cognitive behav-
ioral therapy (CBT) plus active management is better 
than active management alone in terms of pain and 
function.
Linden et al4 assessed the efficacy of CBT for improv-
ing pain tolerance compared to a multimodal inpatient 
orthopedic rehabilitation program alone in patients 
with LBP in a randomized controlled trial. Patients 
with LBP &gt;6 months were randomly allocated into 
an intervention (n=53) or control (n=50) group. All 
patients received 21 days of inpatient treatment in-
cluding various therapies, occupational therapy and 
general patient education sessions on coping. The pa-
tients in the intervention group additionally received 
3 90-minute CBT group sessions per week focused 
on stress reduction, problem solving, self-moni-
toring, pain management, change in dysfunction-
al cognitions, reduction of avoidance behavior and 
well-being therapy. Before and after treatment, pa-
tients reported fear and avoidance per the Fear Avoid-
ance Beliefs Questionnaire (FABQ), subjective pain 
per the VAS Pain (VAS-pain), pain-related disability 
per the Pain Disability Index (PDI) and psychologi-
cal and psychosomatic complaints per the Symptom 
Checklist (SCL-90-R). The intervention group expe-
rienced significantly greater improvements in VAS-
pain (p=0.002) and FABQ (p&lt;0.001). There were no 
differences between groups in changes in PDI and SCL 
scores. The authors concluded that the results of this 
study support the recommendation that CBT should 
be a part of the treatment of chronic LBP. This study 
provides Level I evidence that CBT plus usual care im-
proves short-term pain and disability (over 3 weeks) 
in chronic LBP patients. 
Sullivan et al5 investigated the physical and psycho-
social changes that occur throughout physiotherapy 
with psychotherapy compared to physiotherapy alone 
in a retrospective study of 2 matched cohorts. A da-
tabase of individuals receiving treatment for mus-
culoskeletal conditions was used to systematically 
identify participants with LBP who were enrolled in 
the subacute phase of recovery at various clinics. The 
patients who received physiotherapy plus a Progres-
sive Goal Attainment Program (PGAP) psychothera-
py program (n=24) were matched for age, education, 
duration of sick leave and initial pain severity with 
patients who received only physiotherapy (n=24). 
Due to the retrospective design of this study, the pa-
tients received therapy per the clinical discretion of 
each individual therapist; no specific techniques were described. Participants recorded severity of pain per 
the McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ), pain experience 
per the Pain Rating Index (PRI) within the MPQ and 
the severity of their pain per an 11-point numerical 
rating scale. Function was assessed using a 5-min-
ute walk and finger-to-floor test. Self-perceived 
disability per the Pain Disability Index (PDI), cata-
strophic thinking per the Pain Catastrophizing Scale 
(PCS), fear of re-injury per the Tampa Scale for Ki-
nesiophobia (TSK) and depression per the Beck De-
pression inventory-II (BDI-II) were also recorded. 
Twelve months after treatment termination, partic-
ipants were contacted by telephone. There were no 
post-treatment differences in pain intensity, number 
of pain sites, finger-to-floor test, 5-minute walk dis-
tance or self-reported disability. The participants in 
the physiotherapy + PGAP group had lower MPQ-PRI 
scores (F(1,45)=4.5, p&lt;0.05), measures of pain cata-
strophizing (F(1,45=5.2, p&lt;0.05), fear of movement 
(F(1,45)=5.0, p&lt;0.05) and depression (F(1,45)=23.8, 
p&lt;0.001). The authors concluded that the psycho-
social treatment in addition to physiotherapy alone 
may contribute to more positive outcomes including 
reductions in psychosocial risk factors for pain and 
disability in people with LBP. The work group down-
graded the level of evidence due to small sample size. 
This study provides Level II evidence that psychoso-
cial treatment augments the outcomes of physiother-
apy in terms of reduction of depression, anxiety and 
improved return to work.
Turner et al6 compared the efficacy of cognitive ther-
apy techniques with behavioral treatment in patients 
with chronic LBP in a randomized controlled study. A 
total of 102 patients met inclusion criteria and were 
randomized into a relaxation training (R) group 
(n=24), cognitive therapy (C) group (n=23), cogni-
tive therapy/relaxation training (CR) group (n=25), or 
waiting list (WL) group (n=30). Patients in the R group 
were instructed to use systematic progressive muscle 
relaxation and imagery. Patients in the C group were 
trained to identify and counter negative emotions re-
lated to pain and stress. The CR group combined the 
aspects of the R and C group. All training programs 
were led by psychologists. Measurements including 
pain intensity using a VAS, pain-related physical and 
psychosocial dysfunction using the Sickness Impact 
Profile (SIP), depression using the Beck Depression 
Inventory (BDI), standardized coding of observer 
ratings of pain behaviors, and maladaptive cogni-
tions using the Cognitive Error Questionnaire (CEQ) 
were obtained before treatment and immediately, 6 
months and 12 months after treatment. A total of 17, 
16, 21 and 18 participants completed the treatment  Diagnosis &amp; Treatment of Low Back Pain | Recommendations | Medical &amp; Psychological Treatment

and post-treatment in the R, C, CR and WL groups, re-
spectively. Pain intensity decreased in all 3 treatment 
groups and remained improved at 6- and 12-month 
follow-up. Depressive symptoms and disability im-
proved significantly in all groups, including the WL 
group. There were no differences in results between 
treatment groups. The authors concluded that cogni-
tive therapy may be as effective as relaxation train-
ing in reducing self-reported LBP; however, neither 
relaxation training nor cognitive therapy, alone or in 
combination with each other, is more effective in re-
ducing cognitive errors, depression, disability or pain 
behavior than a waiting list group. This study pro-
vides Level I evidence that CBT, relaxation training 
alone or in combination improve LBP compared to no 
treatment; however these modalities compared to no 
treatment did not improve disability and depression 
over 12 months as compared to no treatment.
Hampel et al7 investigated the effects of a multi-
disciplinary inpatient rehabilitation program with 
cognitive-behavioral management training for pa-
tients with chronic LBP and depressive symptoms. 
Patients from two different inpatient orthopedic re-
habilitation clinics with LBP &gt;6 months and moder-
ate to severe depressive symptoms were assigned to 
a control group or intervention group. The control 
group (n=80) received a standard 3-4 week biopsy-
chosocial multidisciplinary rehabilitation program 
that included medication, physiotherapy, physical 
applications and group sessions with a psychologist 
focusing on cognitive-behavioral pain management 
and muscle relaxation. The intervention group (n=85) 
received the same rehabilitation program plus ad-
ditional group therapy sessions focusing on behav-
ioral activation, cognitive restructuring and social 
skills training from a psychologist. Rehabilitation 
outcome measures such as days of sick leave, depres-
sive symptoms per the Allgemeine Depressions-Skala 
(ADS), anxiety per the Hospital Anxiety and Depres-
sion Scale (HADS-D Anxiety) and somatization per 
the Symptom Checklist (SCL-90-R) were assessed 
at baseline, immediately after rehabilitation and 6, 
12 and 24 months after rehabilitation. A total of 40 
and 44 participants in the control group and inter-
vention group, respectively, completed the program 
and were included in the per-protocol analysis. Per 
both the intention-to-treat and per-protocol anal-
yses, both groups initially showed improvement in 
depressive symptoms and anxiety, but only the inter-
vention group showed persistent improvement over 
24 months. The intervention group had significant-
ly lower depression and anxiety scores at 6 months 
compared to the control group. The authors concluded that the intervention rehabilitation program was su-
perior to the standard rehabilitation alone. In critique 
of the methodology, the workgroup downgraded this 
potential Level I study due to the small sample size. 
Therefore, this study provides Level II evidence that 
adding psychological treatment in people who are 
depressed with LBP improves their depressive symp-
toms over the course of a year and improves anxiety at 
6 months, but not at 2 years.
Monticone et al8 conducted a randomized controlled 
trial pilot study to evaluate the efficacy of a 
multidisciplinary rehabilitation program with exercise 
and CBT compared to exercise alone in patients with 
chronic LBP. Ten patients were randomized into a 
multidisciplinary treatment program group with 
physiatrists, physiotherapists, a psychologist and an 
occupational therapist in which they received usual-
care rehabilitation, spinal stabilizing exercises, 
and individualized CBT aimed at addressing fear of 
movement beliefs, catastrophizing, and negative 
feelings. The control group (n=10) received only usual-
care rehabilitation which involved passive spinal 
mobilization, stretching, muscle strengthening and 
postural control. Disability per the Oswestry Disability 
Index (ODI), kinesiophobia per the Italian Tampa 
Scale of Kinesiophobia (TSK), catastrophizing per the 
Italian Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS), pain rating 
using a numerical rating scale (NRS), quality of life 
using the Italian Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), 
a 6-minute walking test and treatment satisfaction 
using the global perceived effect (GPE) were assessed 
at baseline, after the 8-week treatment period and 
3 months after the treatment ended. The patients in 
the treatment group had significant improvements in 
disability, kinesiophobia, catastrophizing and quality 
of life in group, time and time-by-group interactions. 
The authors concluded that this superiority trial 
revealed that the multidisciplinary rehabilitation 
program with CBT was superior to exercise alone 
in patients with chronic LBP. In critique of the 
methodology, the work group downgraded the level of 
evidence of this potential Level I study due to the small 
sample size. Therefore, this paper provides Level II 
evidence that CBT is better than usual care alone in 
reducing pain and disability from chronic LBP. 
In a multicenter randomized controlled trial, Pincus 
et al9 studied the feasibility of contextual cognitive-
behavioral therapy (CCBT) compared to physiotherapy 
alone in patients classified as “avoidant” with LBP. 
Participants were randomly allocated to the CCBT 
group (n=45) in which they received up to 8 individual 
50-minute sessions with a trained psychologist or the  Diagnosis &amp; Treatment of Low Back Pain | Recommendations | Medical &amp; Psychological Treatment
Recommendations were developed based on a specific definition, inclusion/exclusion criteria, and the resulting literature which excluded conditions 
such as presence of a neurological deficit or leg pain experienced below the knee, among others. Given the exclusion criteria, these guideline rec-
ommendations address a subset of low back pain care as opposed to low back pain in its entirety. This clinical guideline is not intended to be a fixed 
treatment protocol; it is anticipated that there will be patients who require more or less treatment than what is outlined. This clinical guideline should 
not be construed as including all proper methods of care or excluding other acceptable methods of care reasonably directed to obtaining the same 
results. The ultimate judgment regarding any specific procedure or treatment is to be made by the physician and patient in light of all circumstances 
presented by the patient and the needs and resources particular to the locality or institution.85
physiotherapy group (n=44) in which they received up 
to 8 exercise sessions. Questionnaires were completed 
at baseline and 3 and 6 months after randomization 
and included Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia (TSK), 
BPI, Chronic Pain Acceptance Questionnaire (CPAQ), 
Acceptance and Action Questionnaire (AAQ-II), Roland 
Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ), Hospital 
Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), EuroQol-5D, 
Modified Patient Global Impression of Change (PHIC) 
and expectations and satisfaction with treatment. At 
6-month follow-up, most outcomes improved for 
both groups. The CCBT group experienced significantly 
greater improvements in disability per the RMDQ and 
pain per the CPAQ. The authors concluded that CCBT 
is credible and acceptable for patients with LBP and 
psychological obstacles. In critique, the work group 
downgraded the level of evidence for this study due to 
less than 80% follow-up. This study provides Level II 
evidence that CBT is better than physiotherapy alone 
in terms of pain and disability at 6 months. 
Schiltenwolf et al10 studied the efficacy of biopsy-
chosocial treatment compared to biomedical therapy 
alone in patients with subacute LBP in a randomized 
controlled clinical trial. Participants were random-
ized into either the conventional biomedical therapy 
(MT) group (n=31) or the biopsychosocial treatment 
(BT) group (n=33). All participants received 6 hours of 
treatment per day for 15 days over the course of 3 weeks. 
The MT group received physiotherapy, group therapy 
in water, workout, passive interventions such as mas-
sage and physical therapy and education on stretch-
ing, strengthening and improving mobility and body 
control. The BT group received the same biomedical 
therapy as the MT group, but additionally received 
additional psychotherapy and relaxation therapy 3 
and 4 times per week, respectively. Questionnaires 
were completed at baseline, immediately after the 
3-week therapy program and at 6-month follow-up. 
At each time point, pain was assessed using a numeric 
rating scale (NRS), mobility per the finger-floor-test, 
torque of abdominal muscles, functional capacity per 
the Hannover Functional Status Questionnaire-Back 
(FFbH-R), depressive dysfunction (CES-D) and sick 
leave data according to the patient’s insurance com-
pany. A total of 32 (97%) and 29 (94%) participants 
completed the post-treatment evaluation at 3 weeks 
in the BT and MT groups, respectively. Both groups 
experienced improvement in pain intensity and func-
tional capacity of the back (FFbH-R) after 3 weeks, but 
the BT group experienced significantly greater im-
provements at 6 months compared to the MT group. 
The BT group required significantly less sick leave 
(912 days of leave) with 13 out of 22 (59%) not requir-ing further sick leave due to LBP compared to the MT 
group (2,228 days of leave) with 2 out of 20 (10%) not 
requiring further sick leave due to LBP. The authors 
concluded that a biopsychosocial treatment program 
for patients with LBP is beneficial in improving pain, 
functional status and work performance compared 
to conventional biomedical therapy alone. The work 
group downgraded this potential Level I article due to 
small sample size and less than 80% follow-up. This 
study provides Level II evidence that CBT can decrease 
sick leave (improve return to work) as well as pain and 
depression compared to control treatment.
Smeets et al11 conducted a randomized controlled tri-
al to compare active physical, cognitive-behavioral 
therapy (CBT) and a combined treatment for chronic 
LBP compared to a wait list control group. Participants 
with LBP &gt;3 months from three different rehabilita-
tion centers were randomized into the Active Physical 
Treatment group (APT), CBT group, Combined Treat-
ment group, or Waitlist group (WL). The APT group 
(n=53) received aerobic training, individually adjust-
ed based on heart rate and perceived exertion, along 
with strengthening exercises. The participants in the 
CBT group (n=58) did not receive strength or aerobic 
exercises but gradually increased daily activity lev-
el using operant behavioral graded activity training 
and participated problem solving training (PST) with 
a trained psychologist or social worker to help reach 
their goals and modify dysfunctional believes relat-
ed to LBP. The Combined Treatment group (n=61) 
received the same training as the APT group and the 
PST portion of the CBT group. Each treatment group 
received 10 weeks of treatment. The WL group (n=51) 
was offered individual treatment after 10 weeks. Each 
participant completed a questionnaire at baseline, 
immediately after treatment and 6 and 12 months 
after treatment to measure functional limitation per 
the Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ), 
pain and severity of complaints using a 100-mm VAS, 
depression per the Beck Depression Inventory, glob-
al assessment of overall results using an ordinal scale 
and treatment satisfaction using a 100-mm VAS. A 
total of 52, 55, 55 and 50 participants were available 
for analysis immediately after the 10-week treatment 
period in the APT, CBT, Combined Treatment and WL 
groups, respectively. For various reasons such as re-
jection of treatment or non-LBP-associated medical 
or psychological problems, some of those participants 
did not complete sufficient training. A total of 83% 
completed the appropriate APT sessions, 78% and 
76% had sufficient GA and PST sessions (respective-
ly) in the CBT group and 72% and 62% had sufficient 
physical training and GA/PST (respectively). Using an  Diagnosis &amp; Treatment of Low Back Pain | Recommendations | Medical &amp; Psychological Treatment

intention-to-treat analysis, RMDQ, pain and severity 
of complaints significantly improved in all three treat-
ment groups compared to the WL group. The authors 
concluded that all 3 treatment groups were more ef-
fective than the wait list group, but were not statisti-
cally significantly different from each other. The work 
group downgraded this potential Level I study due to a follow-up rate less than 80%. This study provides 
Level II evidence that CBT is better than control (no 
treatment), but not better than physical treatment 
alone in terms of pain and disability at 10 weeks.
Future Directions for Research
The work group recommends future studies that clearly identify what types of 
psychosocial interventions (eg, CBT, neuroscience education), in what frequency 
and what combination is most effective for the treatment of LBP.FLASK

QQMed/Psych Question 6. In patients with low back pain, does the timing of cognitive 
behavioral therapy (CBT) and/ or psychosocial intervention and/or neuroscience 
education affect duration of pain, intensity of pain, functional outcomes, anxiety, 
depression and return-to-work status?
A systematic review of the literature yielded no studies to adequately address this question.
Future Directions for Research
The work group recommends that future studies of cognitive behavioral therapy 
should also include timing and duration of this treatment.FLASK
QQMed/Psych Question 7. In patients undergoing interventional or surgical treatment 
for low back pain, does the addition of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and/or 
psychosocial intervention add incremental benefit?
There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against the addition of cognitive 
behavioral therapy or psychosocial intervention for patients undergoing interventional or surgi-
cal treatment for low back pain and whether it would provide incremental benefit.

Rolving et al1 conducted a randomized clinical trial to 
evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a CBT intervention 
compared to usual care in patients undergoing lum-
bar spinal fusion surgery (LSF). Patients with chron-
ic LBP scheduled for LSF who met inclusion criteria 
were randomly allocated into a control group (n=31) 
or CBT group (n=59). All participants received usual 
care of the LSF operation and rehabilitation 3 months 
post-surgery. The CBT group received additional pre-
operative CBT intervention to address pain-coping 
strategies. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were 
calculated based on EQ-5D scores; a societal view-
point was adapted to calculate costs. There was no difference in the overall cost between groups, but the 
CBT group had a statistically-significantly more fa-
vorable QALY than the control group at one-year fol-
low-up (0.071 QALY, 95% CI: 0.001-0.139, p=0.045). 
Compared to the control group, the CBT group experi-
enced greater reductions in disability per the Oswestry 
disability index (ODI) at 3 months (p=0.003) and 6 
months (p=0.047) but not at one year (p=0.082). The 
authors concluded that preoperative CBT was more 
effective and cost-neutral in the treatment of LSF sur-
gery. This study provides Level I evidence that, in pa-
tients undergoing lumbar fusion, the addition of CBT 
improves function at 3 and 6 months but not at one 
year. Diagnosis &amp; Treatment of Low Back Pain | Recommendations | Medical &amp; Psychological Treatment

QQMed/Psych Question 8. Does educating a patient about low back pain improve 
treatment compliance and outcomes, including duration of pain, intensity of pain,

There is conflicting evidence to make a recommendation for or against the use of patient edu-
cation to improve treatment compliance and outcomes, including duration of pain, intensity of

Cherkin et al1 evaluated the relative effectiveness 
of physical therapy, chiropractic manipulation and 
an educational booklet for the treatment of LBP in a 
randomized controlled trial. Adults with LBP (n=321) 
were randomized to receive one of the three treat-
ments for one month and recorded bothersomeness of 
symptoms on an 11-point scale along with a 24-point 
Roland Disability Scale. There were no significant dif-
ferences in outcomes between the chiropractic and 
physical therapy group; both groups reported slight 
and insignificantly less severe symptoms than the 
educational booklet group after treatment. The au-
thors concluded that the effects of physical therapy 
and chiropractic manipulation had similar effects and 
costs and were marginally better than the effects of 
the educational booklet. This study provides Level I 
evidence that patient education did not improve out-
comes compared to standard care. 
In a randomized controlled trial, Basler et al2 
evaluated the effect of counseling based on the 
Transtheoretical Model (TTM) in elderly patients with 
LBP. Elderly participants with LBP (n=170) received 10 20-minute physiotherapy sessions. Prior to each 
session, the experimental group (n=86) received an 
additional 10 minutes of TTM-based counseling while 
the placebo group (n=84) received an ultrasound 
treatment with an inactivated device. There were no 
significant differences in outcomes such as duration 
of physical activity, functional capacity, or range of 
motion between groups after treatment. The authors 
concluded that a TTM-based motivation program is 
not superior to placebo in the treatment of LBP. This 
study provides Level II evidence that, in older adults 
with chronic LBP, education combined with physical 
therapy did not improve outcomes at 6 months when 
compared to physical therapy alone.
Berwick et al3 conducted a randomized prospective 
trial to compare the effects of an educational pam-
phlet against a single 4-hour back school psychoed-
ucational session with or without a one-year program

status at 3, 6, or 12 months after enrollment. The au-
thors concluded that a short version of back school, 
with or without follow-up reinforcement, is not likely 
to affect pain and disability in patients with LBP. This 
study provides Level II evidence that the addition of 
back school does not improve pain reduction as com-
pared to usual care for acute LBP.
Cecchi et al4 conducted a randomized trial to com-
pare treatments for LBP. Patients with LBP (n=210) 
were randomized to receive spinal manipulation (4-6 
20-minute sessions once-a-week), back school with 
group exercise and education/ergonomics (15 one-
hour sessions for 3 weeks), or individual physiothera-
py with exercise, passive mobilization and soft-tissue 
treatment (4-6 20-minute sessions once per week). 
Pain and function were assessed by Pain Rating Scale 
and Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire, respec-
tively, at 3, 6 and 12 months. The authors concluded 
that spinal manipulation provided functional im-
provement and more pain relief compared to back 
school or individual physiotherapy. This study pro-
vides Level II evidence that spinal manipulation ther-
apy has greater treatment effect than either physical 
therapy or back school in improving disability.
In order to assess the effectiveness of routine phys-
iotherapy compared with advice on remaining active, 
Frost et al5 conducted a randomized controlled trial of 
286 patients with LBP. Although the patients in the 
physiotherapy group reported greater perceived ben-
efit, there were no significant differences in scores of 
the Oswestry disability index, Roland and Morris dis-
ability questionnaire, or SF-36 12 months after en-
rollment. The authors concluded that routine phys-
iotherapy was no more effective than one session of 
assessment and advice from a physiotherapist. This 
study provides Level II evidence that routine physio-
therapy for mild to moderate LBP is no more effective 
than a session with a physiotherapist that includes 
advice.
Hsieh et al6 conducted a randomized trial to compare 
the effectiveness of back school, joint manipulation, 
myofascial therapy and combined joint manipulation 
and myofascial therapy with 200 patients with LBP. 
Participants received the assigned treatment for 3 
weeks. Pain per a visual analog pain scale and activity 
per the Roland-Morris activity scale were recorded at 
baseline, immediately after treatment and 6 months. 
There were no statistically significant differences 
found between groups at either time point. The au-
thors concluded that back school was as effective as 
joint manipulation, myofascial therapy or a combi-nation of the two for treatment of subacute LBP. This 
study provides Level II evidence that back school was 
no more effective than standard treatment.
In a multicenter randomized controlled trial, John-
son et al7 evaluated the effect of a group exercise and 
education program for the treatment of LBP. All par-
ticipants (n=234) received an educational booklet and 
audio-cassette with advice on self-management of 
LBP. Participants were randomized into a 6-week in-
terventional program (n=116) consisting of 8 2-hour 
group sessions with exercise and education delivered 
using a CBT approach or a control group (n=118) which 
did not receive any additional intervention. The inter-
vention group showed only a small but nonsignificant 
effect at reducing pain and disability compared to the 
control group at 12-month follow-up. The authors 
concluded that the intervention program produc-
es only modest effects in reducing LBP and disability 
over a one-year period. This study provides Level II 
evidence (moderate) that exercise with CBT approach 
is no more effective than education with booklets 
alone.
Karjalainen et al8 conducted a multicenter random-
ized controlled trial to study the effectiveness of a 
mini-intervention with or without an additional 
worksite visit compared to usual care for treatment 
of LBP. The patients in the mini-intervention group 
(n=56) received consultations with a physician and 
physiotherapist which included education, encour-
agement of physical activity and exercise planning. 
The worksite visit group (n=51) received the same 
treatment, but had an additional visit with a physio-
therapist, nurse and physician at each participant’s 
workplace to ensure and encourage proper adoption 
of the previous instructions. The patients in the usu-
al care group (n=57) received a leaflet on back pain 
and were treated by their general practitioners. There 
were no significant differences in pain intensity, per-
ceived disability or health-related quality of life be-
tween groups at 3, 6, 12 or 24 months. The authors 
concluded that the mini-intervention is an effective 
treatment for subacute LBP. This study provides Level 
II evidence that mini-intervention does not appear to 
be more effective than worksite visit or usual care.
Leclaire et al9 evaluated the efficacy of a back school 
program compared to physiotherapy alone for 
the treatment of LBP in a randomized controlled 
trial. Participants were randomized to receive daily 
physiotherapy (n=86) or back school with daily 
physiotherapy plus 3 90-minute education sessions 
at weeks 0, 1 and 8 (n=82). There were no differences  Diagnosis &amp; Treatment of Low Back Pain | Recommendations | Medical &amp; Psychological Treatment

between groups in terms of time off work for LBP, 
duration of recurrences in the year after enrollment, 
level of pain, spinal mobility, active straight-leg 
raising, or functional disability per the Oswestry or 
Roland-Morris scales at post-treatment, 6-month, 
or 12-month follow-up. The authors concluded that 
back school did not reduce time to return to work or 
the number or duration of recurrences of LBP after one 
year. This study provides Level II evidence that back 
school does not improve outcomes of physiotherapy 
for treatment of acute LBP in workers.
In a randomized controlled trial, Magalhaes et al10 
compared the effectiveness of graded activity and 
physiotherapy for the treatment of LBP. Participants 
were randomly assigned to groups and received 
individual sessions twice a week for 6 weeks. The 
graded activity group (n=33) included moderate 
intensity treadmill walking, brief education and 
strength exercises. The physiotherapy group (n=33) 
included strengthening, stretching and motor control. 
There were no significant differences in pain (Pain 
Numerical Rating Scale) or disability (Rolland-Morris 
Disability Questionnaire) between groups after 6 
weeks. The authors concluded that graded activity and 
physiotherapy have similar effects for patients with 
chronic LBP. This study provides Level II evidence 
that graded activity and physiotherapy exercises have 
similar beneficial effects in patients with chronic LBP.
Ribeiro et al11 conducted a randomized controlled trial 
to evaluate the effectiveness of a 4-week back school 
program for the treatment of LBP. Patients random-
ized into the intervention group (n=29) received 5 
one-hour group sessions of back school which in-
cluded education, exercise and relaxation. Partici-
pants in the control group (n=31) had weekly medical 
visits without education. There were no significant 
differences between the groups in pain (pain visual 
analogical scale), functional status (Roland-Morris 
Disability Questionnaire), anxiety or depression at 
30, 60 or 120 days after enrollment. The authors con-
cluded that the back school program was ineffective 
in improving quality of life domains, pain, function-
al status, anxiety and depression. This study provides 
Level II (weak) evidence that back school is no more 
effective than meeting with the provider to talk about 
their pain.
Sparkes et al12 conducted a randomized controlled 
trial to assess the effectiveness of an evidence-based 
booklet, The Back Book, for the treatment of LBP. Af-
ter referral from a general practitioner to a spinal pain 
clinic, participants were randomized into an inter-vention group who received The Back Book (n=33) or a 
control group who did not receive the booklet (n=29). 
At the time of the initial appointment at the spinal 
pain clinic, there were no significant differences be-
tween groups in pain (VAS) or disability (Roland Mor-
ris Disability questionnaire). The authors concluded 
that The Back Book may not be suitable if used alone 
for the treatment of LBP. In critique of the methodol-
ogy, the work group downgraded this potential Level 
I study due to the small sample size without a power 
analysis reported. Therefore, this study provides Lev-
el II (weak) evidence that The Back Book is not effec-
tive when given in isolation.
Göhner et al13 studied the effects of a cognitive-
behavioral training program for the treatment of 
patients with LBP. Patients were enrolled in an 
exercise plus a CBT program (n=25) or exercise only 
program (n=22) for 6-8 weeks. Although there were 
significant differences in self-efficacy, perceptions 
and frequency of exercise, there were no differences 
regarding pain intensity between groups immediately 
after the program or 3 or 6 months post-treatment. 
The authors concluded that the CBT program is an 
effective tool to enable patients with LBP to follow 
treatment recommendations. This study provides 
Level III evidence that the addition of CBT enhances 
treatment compliance but does not improve pain 
outcomes with exercise therapy for LBP.
In a randomized controlled trial, Cherkin et al14 eval-
uated the effects of two educational interventions for 
the treatment of LBP compared to a control group. 
Patients received usual care (n=98) or an educational 
booklet with (n=103) or without (n=98) a 15-minute 
session with a clinic nurse who reviewed the booklet, 
answered questions, provided encouragement and 
assisted with goal development related to exercise. 
Outcomes of satisfaction with care, perceived knowl-
edge, participation in exercise, functional status, 
symptom relief and health care use were assessed at 
1, 3, 7 and 52 weeks after the intervention. Although 
the participants in the nurse intervention group re-
ported greater satisfaction and perceived knowledge, 
there were no significant differences between groups 
in terms of functional status, health care use or worry. 
The authors concluded that the educational interven-
tions had no impact on symptoms, function, disabili-
ty, or health care use. In critique of the methodology, 
the work group downgraded the Level of evidence due 
to nonmasked reviewers and patients. This study pro-
vides Level II evidence that patient education did not 
improve outcomes compared to standard care. Diagnosis &amp; Treatment of Low Back Pain | Recommendations | Medical &amp; Psychological Treatment
Recommendations were developed based on a specific definition, inclusion/exclusion criteria, and the resulting literature which excluded conditions 
such as presence of a neurological deficit or leg pain experienced below the knee, among others. Given the exclusion criteria, these guideline rec-
ommendations address a subset of low back pain care as opposed to low back pain in its entirety. This clinical guideline is not intended to be a fixed 
treatment protocol; it is anticipated that there will be patients who require more or less treatment than what is outlined. This clinical guideline should 
not be construed as including all proper methods of care or excluding other acceptable methods of care reasonably directed to obtaining the same 
results. The ultimate judgment regarding any specific procedure or treatment is to be made by the physician and patient in light of all circumstances 
presented by the patient and the needs and resources particular to the locality or institution.91
DuBois et al15 studied the efficacy of a rehabilitation-
oriented coaching intervention compared to a usual 
care control group for the treatment of LBP. In a 
randomized controlled trial, patients allocated to the 
intervention group (n=252) received medical advice 
during a disability evaluation during the first, second 
and third month of sick leave. Patients randomized to 
the control group (n=257) received a brief disability 
evaluation during the third month of sick leave without 
medical advice. Results revealed that the patients in 
the intervention group had a statistically significantly 
higher return-to-work rate at one year. The authors 
concluded that a disability evaluation should include 
reassurance and advice about LBP. This study provides 
Level I evidence that combined counseling and 
disability evaluation by a medical adviser results in a 
higher return-to-work rate due to a lower sick leave 
recurrence than disability evaluation alone.
Durmus et al16 evaluated the effectiveness of an ex-
ercise program with or without back school for the 
treatment of LBP in a randomized controlled trial. 
Subjects (all female) participated in 60 minutes of 
exercise therapy 3 times a week for 3 months. The 
intervention group (n=61) received back school edu-
cation in addition to exercise therapy while the con-
trol group (n=60) only participated in the exercises. 
Both groups showed improvements in outcomes after 
therapy. Compared to the control group, the interven-
tion group had significantly greater improvements for 
pain (per the VAS and pain disability index), pain and 
disability according to the Oswestry Disability Ques-
tionnaire, trunk and knee muscle strength, endurance 
and walking performance. The authors concluded 
that back school increases the effectiveness of exer-
cise programs for the treatment of LBP. This paper 
provides Level I evidence that, in females, back school 
in combination with specific exercise programs was 
more effective than specific exercise therapy alone in 
patients with chronic LBP.
Van den Hout et al17 aimed to evaluate the supplemen-
tal value of problem-solving therapy when added to 
behavioral graded activity for the treatment of LBP in 
a randomized controlled trial. The participants in the 
intervention group (n=45) received behavioral graded 
therapy, group education and CBT focusing on prob-
lem solving for application in daily life. The control 
group (n=39) received behavioral graded activity and 
group education without problem-solving therapy. 
The participants in the intervention group had fewer 
days of sick leave in the second half-year after inter-
vention. The authors concluded that there was value in 
adding problem-solving therapy to behavioral graded activity for the treatment of LBP. This study provides 
Level I evidence that the addition of problem-solving 
therapy to behavioral graded activity had supplemen-
tal value in employees with  non-specific LBP.
In a cluster randomized trial, Albaladego et al18 inves-
tigated the efficacy of a short education and physio-
therapy program for the treatment of LBP. All partic-
ipants received advice, drug treatment and potential 
diagnostic procedures as part of usual care for LBP. The 
control group (n=109) additionally received a booklet 
and group education session on healthy nutrition hab-
its. The Education Group (n=139) was given The Back 
Book with a corresponding education session. The Ed-
ucation + Physiotherapy Group (n=100) received the 
same education as the Education Group in addition to 
an additional booklet and education session on pos-
tural hygiene and 4 one-hour group sessions focusing 
on relaxation techniques, stretching, active exercises 
and encouragement to continue those movements at 
home. Compared to the control group, participants in 
both intervention groups had significantly greater im-
provements in disability per the Roland Morris Ques-
tionnaire and pain per the VAS. The authors concluded 
that the short education program added to usual care 
of patients with LBP leads to small improvements in 
disability, pain and quality of life. This study provides 
Level II evidence that physical therapy plus a short 
education program improves outcomes compared to 
physical therapy alone at 6 months.
Friedrich et al19 conducted a randomized controlled 
trial to evaluate the effect of an exercise and motiva-
tional program in the treatment of LBP. Participants 
were randomly assigned to the control group (n=49) 
with standard exercise or the motivational interven-
tion group (n=44) with exercise combined with ex-
tensive counseling, information and reinforcement 
techniques. Pain (according to a 101-point numerical 
scale), disability (per a 13-question questionnaire) 
and working ability were measured at 3.5 weeks, 4 
months, 12 months and 5 years. The intervention 
group had greater improvements in disability at all 
time points and greater decrease in pain at 5 years. 
Improvement in working ability was only found in the 
intervention group. The authors concluded that the 
combined exercise and motivation group was superior 
to the standard exercise program. This study provides 
Level II evidence that a motivational program (ie, ed-
ucational program) improves the outcome of exercise 
treatment for LBP in terms of function, pain and var-
ious other factors included in the cumulative effects 
at 5 years.
Heymans et al20 conducted a randomized controlled  Diagnosis &amp; Treatment of Low Back Pain | Recommendations | Medical &amp; Psychological Treatment
Recommendations were developed based on a specific definition, inclusion/exclusion criteria, and the resulting literature which excluded conditions 
such as presence of a neurological deficit or leg pain experienced below the knee, among others. Given the exclusion criteria, these guideline rec-
ommendations address a subset of low back pain care as opposed to low back pain in its entirety. This clinical guideline is not intended to be a fixed

not be construed as including all proper methods of care or excluding other acceptable methods of care reasonably directed to obtaining the same 
results. The ultimate judgment regarding any specific procedure or treatment is to be made by the physician and patient in light of all circumstances 
presented by the patient and the needs and resources particular to the locality or institution.92
trial to assess the effectiveness of a low-intensity and 
high-intensity back school compared to usual care for 
workers who were sick-listed due to LBP. The partic-
ipants in the usual care group (n=103) received advice 
to continue normal activities as much as possible. The 
participants in the low-intensity group (n=98) par-
ticipated in 4 sessions of exercise (90 minutes) plus 
education (30 minutes) each week for 4 weeks. The 
participants in the high-intensity group (n=98) par-
ticipated in 2 one-hour exercise sessions per week 
for 8 weeks. Sick leave was recorded throughout the 
study along with pain intensity (VAS) and function-
al status (Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire) at 
baseline and 3 and 6 months. The authors concluded 
that the low-intensity back school was most effec-
tive in reducing work absence, functional disability 
and kinesiophobia. This study provides Level II evi-
dence of the positive effects on work absence for a 
low-intensity back school compared with the effects 
of a high-intensity back school and usual care during 
six months follow-up, in workers sick-listed for sub-
acute  nonspecific LBP. Treatment effects on the sec-
ondary outcomes functional status, kinesiophobia 
and perceived recovery were borderline significant 
at 3 and 6 months, also in favor of the low-intensity 
back school. Differences between groups concerning 
pain relief were small and not statistically significant.
Indahl et al21 studied the long-term effects of an edu-
cation program for treating LBP in a controlled clin-
ical trial. Subjects in the intervention group (n=245) 
participated in a “mini back school” which focused 
on an explanation of back pain and encouragement 
to decrease fear about LBP. Subjects in the control 
group (n=244) were not called in for an examination 
and were treated in the conventional medical system. 
There were fewer recurrences of sick days for the pa-
tients in the intervention group compared to control 
group. The authors concluded information designed 
to reduce fear and increase light activity may help re-
duce long-term disability in patients with LBP. This 
study provides Level II evidence (moderate) that ed-
ucation to reduce fear may improve return-to-work 
status.
Pengel et al22 compared the effectiveness of a 
physiotherapist-directed exercise program, advice 
or both for the treatment of LBP in a randomized 
controlled trial. Participants (n=259) were randomized 
into one of 4 groups: exercise (individualized 
progressive therapy guided by a physiotherapist) and 
advice (graded return to normal activity encouraged 
by a physiotherapist), exercise and sham advice, 
sham exercise and advice, or sham exercise and sham advice. Pain (scale, 0-10), function (Patient-
Specific Functional Scale), global perceived effect 
(11-point scale), disability (Roland-Morris Disability 
Questionnaire), number of health care contacts and 
depression (Depression Anxiety Stress Scales-21) 
were measured at 6 weeks and 12 months. When 
combined, exercise and advice had greater effects 
at 6 weeks for all outcomes, but had greater effects 
only on function at 12 months. The authors concluded 
that exercise and advice were more effective for the 
treatment of LBP compared to placebo at 6 weeks, 
with greater effects observed when the two were 
combined. This study provides Level II evidence that 
exercise and advice were slightly better than exercise 
alone at 12 months follow-up in terms of function for 
treatment of subacute LBP.
Tavafian et al23 conducted a randomized controlled 
trial to assess the effect of a health education pro-
gram, “Back School Programme,” on quality of life 
in patients with LBP. Female participants with LBP 
were randomized into the intervention group (n=50) 
to receive a physician evaluation followed by a 4-day, 
5-session health education program or a control 
group (n=52) to receive only the initial physician eval-
uation and standard care. Quality of life was measured 
using the Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) at base-
line and at three months follow-up. The intervention 
group had significantly better outcomes. The authors 
concluded that the “Back School Programme” might 
improve the quality of life over 3 months in patients 
who experience chronic LBP (CLBP). In critique of the 
methodology, the work group downgraded this po-
tential Level I study due to lack of generalizability. 
This study provides Level II evidence that Back School 
was more effective than a control nonintervention 
population of female patients with CLBP in this short-
term study.
Zhang et al24 conducted a randomized controlled tri-
al to compare the effects of a 12-week exercise pro-
gram with health education on active management 
and postural hygiene compared to exercise alone for 
the treatment of LBP. Participants were randomized 
to receive education plus exercise (n=25) or exercise 
along (n=24) and recorded pain, disability (Oswestry 
Disability Index), muscle endurance and quality of life 
(SF-36) at baseline and immediately after treatment. 
Pain, disability and SF-36 results were significant-
ly better in the health education group compared to 
the exercise-only group. This study was downgrad-
ed from Level I due to small sample size and provides 
Level II evidence that health education provides addi-
tional benefits over and above lumbar exercise alone  Diagnosis &amp; Treatment of Low Back Pain | Recommendations | Medical &amp; Psychological Treatment

for improving the pain, disability and health-related 
quality-of-life of young patients (aged 18–30 years) 
with chronic LBP. 
In a randomized controlled trial, Basler et al25 assessed 
the effects of medical treatment plus cognitive-
behavioral treatment in the treatment of LBP. 
The participants in the intervention group (n=36) 
received usual medical treatment plus 12 weekly 
2.5-hour cognitive-behavioral treatment sessions 
focusing on education, relaxation, modified thoughts 
and feelings, enhancement of pleasant activities 
and training of good postural habits. The control 
group (n=40) received medical treatment only. The 
intervention group experienced less pain, better pain 
control, more pleasurable activities, less avoidance, 
less catastrophizing and reduced disability compared 
to the medical treatment only group. The authors 
concluded that the cognitive-behavioral treatment 
added to medical care resulted in better outcomes 
compared to medical treatment alone. This study 
provides Level III evidence that a treatment package 
of cognitive-behavioral and standard care is more 
effective than standard care alone.
Castagnoli et al26 compared the effects of global pos-
tural reeducation (GPR) to standard physical therapy 
(PT) for the treatment of LBP. All subjects received 
educational booklets and a home exercise program. 
The PT group (n=45) received an individualized 
treatment guided by a physiotherapist while the GPR 
group (n=45) were subjected to a postural assessment 
in which postures were selected to correct identi-
fied muscle imbalances. Both groups received 15 six-
ty-minute sessions twice weekly. Both groups experi-
ences improvement in pain and function at discharge 
(15 working days after enrollment), but only the GPR 
group sustained those improvements at 12 months af-
ter discharge. The authors concluded that GPR and PT 
both result in short-term improvements in function 
and pain; GPR may have longer lasting effects com-
pared to PT. This study provides Level III evidence 
that patients who received global postural reeduca-
tion still reported statistically significant pain relief 
compared to baseline and a lower frequency of pain.
Gremeaux et al27 conducted a randomized study to 
evaluate the effect of education workshops added to 
spa therapy for the treatment of LBP. Participants 
were randomized into the intervention group (n=188) 
to receive 3 90-minute education sessions in ad-
dition to thermal therapy for 3 weeks or the control 
group (n=172) to receive usual thermal therapy and 
non-standardized verbal information. Both groups had significant reductions in physical fear-avoidance 
beliefs (FABQ), disability and pain, with a significant-
ly greater reduction in FABQ in the intervention group 
only. The authors concluded that standardized educa-
tion workshops during spa therapy reduce the effect 
of fear-avoidance beliefs and relieve pain in patients 
with LBP. The work group downgraded the Level of 
evidence for this study in critique of the methodology 
due to nonmasked reviewers and patients. This study 
provides Level II evidence that the addition of patient 
education improves the outcomes of spa therapy for 
LBP.
Iles et al28 compared the effects of telephone coaching 
in addition to physiotherapy with physiotherapy 
alone for the treatment of LBP in a randomized trial. 
Participants were randomized into the intervention 
group (n=15) to receive 5 sessions of telephone 
coaching or the control group (n=15) to receive 
physiotherapy alone. The coaching group had 
significantly greater scores for function (Patient 
Specific Functional Scale) and recovery expectation. 
The authors concluded that the addition of telephone 
coaching to physiotherapy improved activity and 
recovery expectation. This study provides Level III 
evidence (weak) that telephone coaching may improve 
patient-specific functional outcomes in patients with 
chronic LBP.
Jaromi et al29 hypothesized that nurses with LBP 
would have significantly decreased pain intensity lev-
els and improved body posture after completing a pro-
gram with ergonomics training and education (Back 
School) once a week for 6 weeks compared to a control 
group receiving passive physiotherapy once a week 
for 6 weeks. Although both groups showed improve-
ment in pain intensity immediately after therapy, the 
Back School group (n=56) had significantly better 
improvements at 6 months and one year compared to 
the control group (n=55). The authors concluded that 
Back School results in significant improvements in 
pain intensity and posture in nurses who are experi-
encing chronic lower back pain. This study provides 
Level III evidence that, in working nurses with chron-
ic LBP, the addition of back school to passive physical 
therapy results in a significantly better result at one 
year than physical therapy alone.
Paolucci et al30 conducted a randomized controlled 
trial to evaluate the effect of a Back School program in 
the treatment of LBP. The intervention group (n=29) 
participated in a 4-week multidisciplinary Back 
School program with education and exercise while 
the control group (n=21) received medical assistance  Diagnosis &amp; Treatment of Low Back Pain | Recommendations | Medical &amp; Psychological Treatment

only. Significant improvements in quality of life (SF-
36), disability (Waddell Disability Index and Oswestry 
Disability Index) and pain (VAS) were observed in the 
intervention group. Additional mental component 
improvements in the SF-36 were observed in the pa-
tients in the intervention group who had at least one 
scale elevation in Minnesota Multiphasic Personality 
Inventory-II (MMPI-II) scores. The authors conclud-
ed that Back School has positive effects in patients 
with at least one scale elevation of MMPI-II. The work 
group downgraded the level of evidence of this study 
due to small sample size. This study provides Level II 
evidence for the effectiveness of back school.
Burton et al31 conducted a randomized controlled 
trial to study the effects of a novel educational booklet on patients’ beliefs on LBP and functional 
outcomes. Patients with LBP received The Back Book 
with evidence-based information and advice (n=53) 
compared to a traditional booklet control group 
(n=50). The participants who received The Back 
Book had significant improvements in beliefs about 
physical activity at 2 weeks, 3 months and one year. 
There were no statistically significant differences 
between groups in pain or disability. The authors 
concluded that carefully selected information and 
advice on LBP can have a positive effect on outcomes 
for individuals with LBP. This study provides Level II 
evidence that patient education can improve function 
but not pain up to 3 months following usual treatment 
for LBP.
Future Directions for Research
The work group recommends future studies to evaluate whether the inclusion of 
patient education impacts LBP treatment compliance and outcomes.FLASK

QQMed/Psych Question 9. In patients undergoing treatment for low back pain, what 
is the effectiveness of interventions that address fear-avoidance behaviors?
Treatments targeting fear avoidance combined with physical therapy are recommended com-
pared to physical therapy alone to improve low back pain in the first 6 months.
 Grade of Recommendation: A  
George et al1 conducted a multicenter randomized 
controlled trial to compare physical therapy to fear-
avoidance-based physical therapy in patients with 
acute LBP. Eligible patients were randomized into one 
of 2 groups to receive either standard physical ther-
apy (n=32) or fear-avoidance-based physical ther-
apy (n=34). All participants received education and a one-hour individualized treatment with exercise 
prescriptions and progressions while recording home 
participation in a diary. The participants in the fear-
avoidance-based physical therapy group additionally 
received specific education with fear-avoidance mod-
el principles and a graded exercise program with pos-
itive reinforcement. At baseline, 4 weeks after treat- Diagnosis &amp; Treatment of Low Back Pain | Recommendations | Medical &amp; Psychological Treatment
Recommendations were developed based on a specific definition, inclusion/exclusion criteria, and the resulting literature which excluded conditions 
such as presence of a neurological deficit or leg pain experienced below the knee, among others. Given the exclusion criteria, these guideline rec-
ommendations address a subset of low back pain care as opposed to low back pain in its entirety. This clinical guideline is not intended to be a fixed 
treatment protocol; it is anticipated that there will be patients who require more or less treatment than what is outlined. This clinical guideline should 
not be construed as including all proper methods of care or excluding other acceptable methods of care reasonably directed to obtaining the same 
results. The ultimate judgment regarding any specific procedure or treatment is to be made by the physician and patient in light of all circumstances 
presented by the patient and the needs and resources particular to the locality or institution.96
ment and 6 months after treatment, each participant 
completed a questionnaire that addressed disability 
per the Oswestry Disability Questionnaire (ODQ), pain 
intensity on a scale from 0 to 10 and fear-avoidance 
beliefs per the Fear-Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire 
(FABQ). Using an intention to treat analysis, disabil-
ity and pain intensity improved in both groups. The 
fear-avoidance beliefs significantly improved in the 
fear-avoidance therapy group and were significantly 
lower than the standard therapy group at both fol-
low-up time points. The authors concluded that pa-
tients with elevated fear-avoidance beliefs at base-
line experienced less disability with fear-avoidance 
treatment compared to standard treatment; however, 
those with reduced fear-avoidance fared worse with 
an increase in fear-avoidance with the fear-avoid-
ance-based physical therapy. The work group down-
graded this potential Level I study due to recruitment 
and small sample size. This study provides Level II 
evidence that fear avoidance-based physical therapy 
can improve outcomes more than standard physical 
therapy for treatment of acute LBP in patients with 
elevated fear-avoidance on screening questionnaire. 
Screening would be indicated as a blanket approach 
and would not work well without screening for fear 
avoidance. 
George et al2 later conducted another multicenter 
randomized controlled trial to compare physical ther-
apy to physical therapy combined with graded exer-
cise or graded exposure in patients with acute and 
subacute LBP. Eligible patients were randomized into 
a treatment-based classification (TBC) physical ther-
apy group (n=36), TBC plus graded activity/exercise 
(GA) group (n=37), or TBC with graded exposure (GX) 
group (n=35). The participants in the TBC group re-
ceived education and an individualized treatment. 
The participants in the GA group received treatment 
similar to the TBC group but augmented with grad-
ually increased activity according to pain tolerance. 
The participants in the GA group first completed a 
questionnaire to indicate existing fear (such as lift-
ing more than 20 pounds) which the therapist used 
to guide gradually-progressing activities to improve 
movements related to that goal. Questionnaires were 
administered at baseline, 4 weeks and 6 months which 
collected demographic information, disability per the 
Oswestry Disability Questionnaire (ODQ), fear-avoid-
ance beliefs per the Fear-Avoidance Beliefs Question-
naire (FABQ) and pain catastrophizing per the Pain 
Catastrophizing Scale (PCS). Additionally, a blinded 
physical therapist used the physical impairment scale 
(PIS) at baseline and 4 weeks to quantify physical im-
pairment. A total of 26, 22 and 24 participants com-pleted the 6-month follow-up in the TBC, GA and GX 
groups, respectively. All groups experienced improve-
ment in ODQ scores; however, there were no signifi-
cant differences in improvements between groups. All 
groups had an improvement in FABQ scores; both TBC 
and GX showed significant decreases in pain-relat-
ed fear (p&lt;0.01). Intention to treat analyses showed 
similar results as the completers-only analyses. The 
authors concluded that in patients with LBP, add-
ing GA or GX to TBC was not effective for improving 
outcomes. This study provides Level I evidence that 
treatment-based classification physical therapy sup-
plemented with graded activity or graded exposure 
was not effective for improving outcomes related to 
the development of chronic LBP
Monticone et al3 conducted a randomized, parallel-
group, superiority-controlled trial to evaluate the 
efficacy of a CBT-based multidisciplinary program 
on perceived disability, kinesiophobia, pain and 
QoL in patients with  nonspecific chronic LBP. 
Patients with LBP for &gt;3 months were randomized 
to receive a program with exercise and CBT (n=45) 
or an exercise-only program (n=45). All participants 
received training on a 60-minute exercise program 
that involved active and passive spine mobilization, 
muscle strengthening and stretching and postural 
control twice a week for a 5-week instructive phase 
and were instructed to continue twice-weekly sessions 
independently for a year. The participants in the 
exercise and CBT (experimental) group additionally 
received a 60-minute CBT session under the 
supervision of a clinical psychologist once a week for 
5 weeks followed by one session per month for a year. 
All participants completed questionnaires at baseline, 
after the 5-week instructive phase and then at 12 
and 24 months. Questionnaires measured disability 
per the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire 
(RMDQ), fear-avoidance behaviors per the Tampa 
Scale for Kinesiophobia (TSK), pain using an 11-point 
numerical rating scale (NRS) and QoL per the Short-
Form (36) Health Survey (SF-36). No patients dropped 
out during this study. The patients in the experimental 
group experienced significant improvements in 
RMDQ, TSK, NRS and SF-36 scores (p&lt;0.001 for all). 
The authors concluded that the CBT and exercise 
program was superior to the program with exercise 
alone in reducing disability, fear-avoidance beliefs 
and pain and enhancing the quality of life of patients 
with chronic LBP. This study provides Level I evidence 
that cognitive behavior therapy specifically targeting 
FAB can improve outcomes of treatment for chronic 
LBP better than exercise alone for the first year. Diagnosis &amp; Treatment of Low Back Pain | Recommendations | Medical &amp; Psychological Treatment
Recommendations were developed based on a specific definition, inclusion/exclusion criteria, and the resulting literature which excluded conditions 
such as presence of a neurological deficit or leg pain experienced below the knee, among others. Given the exclusion criteria, these guideline rec-
ommendations address a subset of low back pain care as opposed to low back pain in its entirety. This clinical guideline is not intended to be a fixed 
treatment protocol; it is anticipated that there will be patients who require more or less treatment than what is outlined. This clinical guideline should 
not be construed as including all proper methods of care or excluding other acceptable methods of care reasonably directed to obtaining the same 
results. The ultimate judgment regarding any specific procedure or treatment is to be made by the physician and patient in light of all circumstances 
presented by the patient and the needs and resources particular to the locality or institution.97
Woods et al4 conducted a randomized controlled trial to 
evaluate the effectiveness of a graded in vivo exposure 
(GivE) therapy program on improving self-efficacy 
and reducing fear, avoidance, emotional distress, 
perceived pain and perceived disability in patients with 
LBP. A total of 85 participants met inclusion criteria 
after recruitment through advertisement, had a score 
≥38 on the Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia (TSK) and 
were randomized into one of 3 groups: GivE (n=36), 
graded activity (n=25) and wait-list control (n=22). At 
baseline, each participant completed a questionnaire 
which included functional ability per the Pain Disability 
Index (PDI), ratings of pain and psychological factors 
per the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale 
(HADS), McGill Pain Questionnaire-Short Form (SF-
MPQ), Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire (PSEQ), TSK, 
Fear Avoidance Belief Questionnaire (FABQ), short 
form of Pain Anxiety Symptoms Scale (PASS-20), 
Pain Catastrophising Scale (PCS) and the Working 
Alliance Inventory – Client Form (WAI). Participants 
in both treatment groups received 8 individualized 
45-minute therapy sessions over the course of four 
weeks. The participants in the graded activity group 
received therapy from a Registered Physiotherapist 
along with positive reinforcement. The participants in the GivE group received education 
about the cognitive-behavioral perspective on fear-
avoidance and its consequences in addition to the 
same treatment as the graded activity group. The 
wait-list control group was offered participation 
at a later time. A total of 15, 13 and 16 participants 
completed the GivE, graded activity and wait-list 
control therapy programs, respectively. Per an 
intention-to-treat analysis, there were no significant 
differences in outcomes between GivE and graded 
activity. However, participants in the GivE group had 
significant improvements on the TSK (p = .011), FABQ 
(p = .020), PCS (p = .010), HADS (p = .010) and SF-MPQ 
(p = .030) compared to the wait-list control group. 
With a complete case analysis, participants in the GivE 
group had significantly greater improvement in PSEQ 
(p=0.028), TSK (p=0.008), FABQ (p=0.027) and PASS-
20 (p=0.027) compared to the graded activity group. 
The work group determined this study provides Level 
I evidence that graded activity exposure, targeted 
towards decreasing fear avoidance behavior compared 
to standard treatment or no treatment, can improve 
outcomes in patients with chronic LBP.
Future Directions for Research
The work group recommends longer-term follow-up studies (one year or great-
er) to determine longitudinal benefits of treatments targeting fear avoidance. FLASK

QQMed/Psych Question 10. Is active treatment (pharmacological or 
psychotherapeutic) of anxiety and depression effective in decreasing low back 
pain? 
A systematic review of the literature yielded no studies to adequately address this question.
Future Directions for Research
The work group recommends consideration of a clinical trial to assess whether 
active treatment of depression or anxiety can improve back pain.FLASK
QQMed/Psych Question 11. What are the psychological factors influencing 
outcomes, including duration of pain, intensity of pain, functional outcomes and 
return-to-work status, of low back pain treatment?
It is suggested that kinesiophobia is a negative prognostic factor for predicting response to low 
back pain treatment.
 Grade of Recommendation: B  
Foster et al1 conducted a prospective cohort study 
across 8 general practices to evaluate the association 
between psychological factors at the time of presen-
tation of LBP as well as the psychological factors that 
predict clinical outcomes after 6 months. A total of 
1,591 patients with LBP completed a questionnaire at 
baseline which included the Roland and Morris Dis-
ability Questionnaire (RMDQ) and questions related 
to sociodemographics and psychological factors. After 
6 months, 810 patients completed the same question-
naire. At baseline, there were associations between 
RMDQ scores and 18 out of 20 of the psychological 
factors; the strongest correlations were found in per-
ceptions of consequences (IPQ-R), depression (HADS) 
and pain self-efficacy (PSEQ). At 6 months, acute/
chronic timeline, illness identity, perceptions of per-
sonal control and pain self-efficacy were significantly 
predictive of LBP outcomes (RMDQ) using a reduced 
multivariate model (n=761). The authors concluded 
that patients who experience these four psychological 
factors are more likely to have poor clinical outcomes. 
The work group determined that this study provides 
Level III evidence that perception of personal con-trol, illness identity and pain self-efficacy were psy-
chological factors that were predictive of outcomes of 
LBP treatment. 
Helmhout et al2 evaluated relationship of improve-
ment of chronic LBP and baseline individual factors, 
pain-related factors, work-related psychosocial fac-
tors and psychological factors in a prospective cohort 
study of data from three randomized controlled tri-
als. A total of 273 military employees, predominant-
ly male, were recruited by a general practitioner or 
military advertisements. Each participant completed 
a questionnaire at baseline which included functional 
disability per the Roland-Morris Disability Question-
naire (RMDQ), details of LBP complaints (duration 
and pain radiation), fear of movement per the Tam-
pa Scale for Kinesiophobia (TSK), psychological dis-
tress per the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ), 
perceived social and coworker support and degree of 
physical activity. Six months after treatment, partic-
ipants completed the same questionnaire again along 
with perceived improvement (0-100%) or the Global 
Perceived Effect (GPE). Improvement was defined by  Diagnosis &amp; Treatment of Low Back Pain | Recommendations | Medical &amp; Psychological Treatment

improvement of ≥30% on the RMDQ and an improve-
ment of ≥20% of self-perceived improvement or a 
GPE score of “completely recovered” or “much im-
proved.” Significant associations were found between 
long-term LBP improvement and RMDQ score of 4-7 
(OR 2.29), RMDQ score ≥11 (OR 2.53) and TSK score 
(OR 0.97) at baseline. The authors concluded that in-
dividuals with a high level of baseline disability and 
fear avoidance behavior are at risk for poor long-term 
recovery from LBP and may need additional cogni-
tive behavioral treatment. This study provides Level II 
evidence that kinesiophobia can negatively influence 
the outcomes of LBP treatment.
 
Keeley et al3 conducted a prospective cohort study to 
assess the predictive relationship between both so-
cial and psychological factors at baseline with phys-
ical health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and health 
service utilization in patients with mechanical LBP. 
At baseline, each participant (n=108) completed a 
questionnaire that included demographic informa-
tion, details of back pain, anxiety and depression 
symptoms per the Hospital Anxiety and Depression 
Scale (HADS), beliefs about the relationship between 
physical activity and LBP per the Fear-Avoidance Be-liefs Questionnaire (FABQ) and social stress per the 
Life Events and Difficulties Schedule (LEDS). Phys-
ical HRQoL was measured at baseline and 6 months 
after initial assessment using the UK version of the 
36-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) Phys-
ical Component Score (PCS). Health care utilization 
was measured for 6 months after initial assessment 
using the Client Socio-Demographic and Service 
Receipt Inventory (CSSRI). At 6-month follow-up, 
baseline variables found to have a statistical signifi-
cant prediction of physical HRQoL included duration 
of pain (standardized regression coefficient β=0.18, 
p=0.04), HADS score (β=0.27,p=0.003) and back pain 
related social difficulties (β=0.42, p&lt;0.0005). Fear 
Avoidance Beliefs about work (Incident Rate Ratio 
[IRR]=1.02,p=0.009), back pain related social diffi-
culties (IRR=1.16, p=0.03) and perceived cause of pain 
(IRR=1.46, p=0.03) were independent predictors of 
number of health care contacts. The authors conclud-
ed that anxiety, depression, fear avoidance beliefs re-
lating to work and back pain-related stresses are pre-
dictors of physical HRQoL and number of health care 
utilization contacts. This study provides Level III evi-
dence that SF-36 scores improved in patients without 
fear avoidance behavior before treatment. 
Future Directions for Research
The work group recommends development of registries that collect information 
regarding psychological factors that can influence low back pain and quantita-
tive analysis of this information.FLASK

Q1 Evidence Summary: 
In a randomized controlled trial of patients with 
chronic low back pain (LBP), Durmus et al1 evaluat-
ed the effectiveness of the addition of back school to 
a modified exercise program. Participants were ran-
domized to receive an exercise program with back 
school (n=61) or exercise alone (n=60) 3 days a week 
for 3 months. Pain (Visual Analog Scale, VAS) and dis-
ability (Oswestry Disability Questionnaire) were re-
corded at baseline, immediately after treatment and 
at 6-month follow-up. The participants who received 
back school in addition to exercise had significantly greater improvements in pain and disability. The au-
thors concluded that modified exercise programs can 
be used to treat chronic LBP and that the addition of 
back school can further increase the effect. This study 
provides Level I therapeutic evidence that the addition 
of low back school to an exercise program improves 
pain and function at 6 months.

12 months were invited to participate and random-
ized into a treatment group (n=95) or control group 
(n=93). Patients in the treatment group completed 6 
60-minute exercise and education sessions over three 
weeks plus 2 additional 60-minute review classes af-
ter 6 months. The control group received written ma-
terials and otherwise continued regular follow-up 
healthcare services. Pain (VAS and low back pain in-
dex), disability (Oswestry Disability Questionnaire), 
spinal mobility and strength, and length of sick leave 
were recorded at baseline and at 6- and 12-month 
follow-up. The treatment group experienced signifi-
cantly greater improvements in pain, disability and 
mobility compared to the control group at 12-month 
follow-up. The authors concluded that patients with 
chronic or recurrent LBP may get relief of subjective 
symptoms from back school. This study offers Level 
I therapeutic evidence that for women with nonspe-
cific chronic LBP, a back school regimen of education 
and exercise 6 times in 3 weeks and reviewed with 2 
sessions at 6 months improves pain and disabili-
ty at 6 months compared to education booklet con-
trols. Though clinically meaningful improvements 
were only seen for pain at 6 months; the intervention 
group did not have improvements in sick leave or oth-
er medical treatment.
Jaromi et al3 conducted a randomized controlled trial 
to assess the effectiveness of a spine training program 
(Back School) in nurses with chronic LBP. Partici-
pants randomized to the control group (n=55) re-
ceived passive physiotherapy once a week for 6 weeks. 
The intervention group (n=56) received ergonomics 
training and an educational Back School program. 
Pain intensity (VAS) and body posture (Zebris biome-
chanical motion analysis) were recorded at baseline, 
immediately after treatment and at 6- and 12-month follow-up. The participants in the intervention group 
had significantly greater improvements in back pain 
intensity at both follow-up points and significant-
ly greater improvement in back posture. The authors 
concluded that back school, including active physi-
cal therapy methods, can significantly improve pain 
intensity and body posture in nurses with LBP. This 
study provides Level I therapeutic evidence that for 
health care workers with nonspecific chronic LBP, 
back school one time per week for 6 weeks is effec-
tive at decreasing pain at the end of treatment, 6-and 
12-month follow-up. Passive PT in the same study 
showed improvement in pain only at the end of treat-
ment. The results retained clinically meaningful lev-
els at 6 and 12 months for the treatment group as 
compared to the control group.
In a randomized controlled trial, Morone et al4 
evaluated the effects of a multidisciplinary back 
school program in patients with chronic LBP. Patients 
with LBP for at least 3 months were randomized to 
participate in 4 weeks of either a multidisciplinary 
Back School program with education and exercises 
(n=44) or a control group with medical assistance 
(n=29). Quality of life (Short Form 36), disability 
(Waddell Disability Index and Oswestry Disability 
Index) and pain perceptions (VAS) were recorded at 
baseline, after treatment completion and at 3- and 
6-month follow-up. The Back School participants had 
significantly greater improvements in quality of life, 
disability and pain perception. The authors concluded 
that the Back School program investigated can be an 
effective treatment in people with chronic nonspecific 
LBP. This study provides Level I therapeutic evidence 
that a back school program can improve quality of 
life, disability and pain in nonspecific chronic LBP

There is insufficient evidence that outcomes from a home-based exercise program are different

 Grade of Recommendation: I  
Kuukkanen et al5 conducted a randomized controlled 
trial and 5-year follow-up to evaluate the long-term 
effectiveness of a home exercise program in relieving 
pain and improving function in patients with chron-
ic LBP. Participants with LBP for at least 3 years were 
randomized into a home exercise group (n=29) or 
control group with no exercise (n=28). LBP intensity 
(Borg CR-10 scale) and function (Oswestry Disability Index) were recorded at baseline and at 5-year fol-
low-up. LBP intensity and function improved in both 
groups after 3 months; pain intensity remained sig-
nificantly lower in the home exercise group compared 
to the control group at 5-year follow-up. The authors 
concluded that supervised, controlled home exercises 
can reduce LBP over 5 years. This study was down-
graded to Level II due its small sample and provides  Diagnosis &amp; Treatment of Low Back Pain | Recommendations | Physical Medicine &amp; Rehabilitation

provides pain improvements at 5-year follow-up. 
There was no statistically significant difference in 
function as compared with no treatment. 
In a multicenter, randomized controlled trial, Shirado 
et al6 evaluated the effectiveness of home-based
exercise on pain, dysfunction and quality of life (QOL) 
in Japanese individuals with chronic LBP. Participants 
were randomized to a treatment group to complete 
trunk muscle strengthening and stretching exercises 
(n=103) or a control group to be treated with nonste-
roidal anti-inflammatory drugs (n=98). Pain intensi-
ty (VAS) and dysfunction (Japan Low back pain Eval-
uation Questionnaire and Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire, RMDQ) were recorded at baseline, af-
ter treatment and at 6- and 12-month follow-up. Both 
groups experienced improvement in pain and dys-
function; however, the exercise treatment group had 
a statistically significantly greater improvement in 
function (95% confidence interval for the difference 
of median of change ratio was from -0.33 to 0.00). The 
authors concluded that the home-based exercise pro-
gram was more effective than nonsteroidal anti-in-
flammatory drugs in Japanese patients with chronic 
LBP. This study offers Level I therapeutic evidence 
that a home-based program with frequent physician 
oversight resulted in significantly better function and 
similar pain outcomes at one year compared to non-
steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.
There is insufficient evidence that a self-directed McKenzie exercise program for acute low 
back pain results in different outcomes compared to usual medical care. 
 Grade of Recommendation: I  
In a randomized controlled trial, Underwood et al7 
examined the effectiveness of teaching back exer-
cises based on the McKenzie approach in addition to 
usual care for acute LBP. Patients with acute LBP for 
less than 28 days were randomized to attend a group 
back class (n=35) or receive conventional manage-
ment (n=40). Disability (Oswestry disability score) 
and pain (VAS) were recorded at baseline and 4, 8, 12 
and 52 weeks after study enrollment. There were no differences in the primary outcome measures for pain 
or disability between groups. The authors conclud-
ed that the back class was not effective compared to 
conventional care. The sample size was small and the 
study was underpowered. This study provides Lev-
el II therapeutic evidence that there is no difference 
in pain or disability scores in patients with acute LBP 
treated with a McKenzie exercise program compared 
to usual care.
There is insufficient evidence that a monitored pedometer-based exercise program with web-
based feedback provides any improvement over pedometer instruction alone. 
 Grade of Recommendation: I  
Krein et al8 conducted a randomized controlled trial 
to determine whether a pedometer-based internet-
mediated program can reduce disability due to chronic 
back pain. After trial enrollment, veterans with  
nonspecific chronic back pain received a pedometer. 
The intervention group (n=111) also received access to 
a website with walking goals, feedback, motivational 
messages and social support, while the control group 
(n=118) did not. Disability (Roland Morris Disability 
Questionnaire) was recorded at baseline and at 6- and 12-month follow-up. The results showed slight 
improvement in the intervention group. This was 
statistically significant at 6 months but not at one 
year and in neither case was the difference clinically 
meaningful. This study provides Level I evidence that 
a walking program resulted in improved function, 
but the addition of internet based instruction and 
motivation did not make a clinically meaningful 
difference in improvement. Diagnosis &amp; Treatment of Low Back Pain | Recommendations | Physical Medicine &amp; Rehabilitation

Q1 Evidence Summary:
Dehghan and Farahbod9 studied the efficacy of ther-
motherapy and cryotherapy added to pharmacologic 
treatment in a randomized trial of patients with LBP. 
Patients with LBP for less than one month received 
500 mg naproxen twice daily and were randomized 
to receive additional thermotherapy (hot water bag), 
cryotherapy (ice), or naproxen only (n=29 in each 
group) for one week. Pain (McGill Pain Questionnaire) 
was recorded at baseline and on the 3rd, 8th and 15th 
day after enrollment. Pain significantly reduced in the 
thermotherapy and cryotherapy groups by the sec-
ond visit; the thermotherapy group had significantly 
greater reductions than the cryotherapy group. The 
authors concluded that thermotherapy and cryother-
apy are effective in the short-term to help reduce pain 
in patients with acute LBP. This study provides Level 
II evidence that addition of heat or cold to an NSAID 
results in improved outcomes for pain compared to 
NSAID alone for acute back patients at 3 weeks.
Kettenman10 et al conducted a randomized controlled 
trial to determine the efficacy of heat therapy in patients with LBP. Patients with LBP for less than 3 
months were randomized to the intervention group 
with heat-wrap therapy for at least 4 hours a day for 4 
consecutive days (n=15) or control group without heat 
therapy (n=15). Both groups received nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to use as needed. 
Subjective reports of sleep, well-being and pain 
intensity (Pain, Sleep and Stress Questionnaire) were 
recorded in a patient diary and the power of frequency 
bands in the spontaneous electroencephalogram 
(EEG) were recorded on days 2 and 4. The patients 
in the heat therapy group reported significantly 
improved pain, less stressful everyday situations and 
sleep. EEG-recordings in the heat group indicated 
reduced arousal as evidenced by decreased power in 
frequency bands. The authors concluded that heat 
therapy resulted in improved pain, psychophysical 
measures and objective measures that suggest acute 
therapeutic relaxation. This study provides Level 
II evidence that addition of heat therapy to NSAIDs 
results in better pain scores than NSAIDs alone in 
patients with acute back pain at 4-week follow-up. Diagnosis &amp; Treatment of Low Back Pain | Recommendations | Physical Medicine &amp; Rehabilitation

In a randomized controlled trial, Mayer11 et al inves-
tigated the effect of combining continuous low-level 
heat wrap therapy with directional preference-based 
exercises on functional outcomes in patients with 
acute LBP. Patients with LBP for less than 3 months 
were randomized to receive 5 consecutive days of heat 
wrap therapy alone (n=25), exercise alone (n=25), 
heat wrap plus exercise (n=24) or a control group 
booklet (n=26). Functional improvement (0-200 Rat-
ing of Perceived Capacity-Spine), disability (Roland 
Morris Disability Questionnaire) and pain (6-point 
verbal rating scale) were recorded at baseline and 
day 2, 3 and 7 follow-ups. The combination of heat 
wrap plus exercise resulted in significantly greater 
improvements in function, disability and pain relief 
compared to each individual treatment or control. The 
authors concluded that a combination of heat wrap 
therapy with directional preference-based exercise is 
more effective for the treatment of LBP compared to 
either intervention alone or control treatment (book-
let). This study provides Level II evidence that heat 
and exercise together result in better pain scores than 
heat or exercise alone in patients with acute back pain 
at 7-day follow-up.
Nadler et al12 aimed to determine the efficacy of con-
tinuous low-level heat wrap therapy for the treatment 
of acute  nonspecific LBP in a randomized, parallel, 
single-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical 
trial. Patients with acute LBP for less than 3 months 
were randomized to receive 3 consecutive days of heat 
wrap therapy for 8 consecutive hours per day (n=95), 
oral placebo (n=96), oral ibuprofen (n=12) or unheat-
ed back wrap (n=16) after being stratified by baseline 
pain and gender. Pain (0-5-point verbal response 
scale), muscle stiffness (numeric rating scale), lateral 
trunk flexibility and disability (Roland-Morris Dis-
ability Questionnaire) were recorded over the course 
of the 3-day treatment and 2 days of follow-up. The 
patients in the heat wrap group had significantly 
greater pain relief, less muscle stiffness, increased 
flexibility and reduced disability. The authors con-
cluded that continuous low-level heat wrap therapy 
was effective for the treatment of acute,  nonspecific 
LBP. This study provides Level II evidence that heat 
wrap results in better pain and disability scores as 
compared to oral placebo in patients with acute back 
pain. Heat wrap results in better pain scores than pla-
cebo heat wrap or NSAIDs.
Nadler et al13 studied the safety and efficacy of eight 
hours of continuous overnight low-level heat wrap 
therapy for the treatment of LBP in a randomized, 
single-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter clin-ical trial. Patients with LBP for less than 3 months 
were randomized to receive 3 consecutive days of heat 
wrap therapy (n=33), oral placebo (n=34), unheated 
wrap (n=5) or oral ibuprofen (n=4) after being strati-
fied for baseline pain and gender. Morning pain relief 
(0-5-point verbal response scale), daytime pain relief, 
extended pain relief, muscle stiffness, lateral trunk 
flexibility, and disability (Roland-Morris Disability 
Questionnaire) were recorded on days 2 through 4. 
All outcomes were significantly improved in the heat 
wrap group. The authors concluded that use of a heat 
wrap overnight resulted in improved pain relief, less 
muscle stiffness and disability and improved flexi-
bility sustained more than 48 hours after treatment 
completion. This study provides Level II evidence that 
overnight heat wrap results in better pain and disabil-
ity scores as compared to oral placebo in patients with 
acute back pain.
Shakoor et al14 investigated the effects of deep heat 
therapy for the treatment of patients with chronic 
LBP. Patients with LBP for more than 3 months 
were randomized to receive nonsteroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and short-wave 
diathermy (n=50) or NSAIDs and placebo short-
wave diathermy (n=52). Pain intensity, disability 
and physical impairment were assessed using 
the Lettinen Test Scores and VAS. Both groups 
experienced improvements, with significantly greater 
improvements in the short wave diathermy group 
compared to the placebo group at weeks 3 and 6. The 
authors concluded that although both interventions 
may be beneficial for the treatment of LBP, treatment 
with short wave diathermy added to NSAID use may 
be more beneficial than NSAID use alone. This study 
provides Level II evidence that diathermy, exercise 
and NSAIDs results in nonsignificant improvement in 
VAS scores at 6 weeks relative to sham, exercise and 
NSAIDs for treatment of chronic LBP. 
Tao et al15 conducted a randomized controlled trial 
to study the effects of an education program with or 
without heat wrap therapy in patients with acute LBP. 
Patients with work-related LBP for less than 3 months 
were randomized to receive back therapy education 
and pain management (n=18) or back therapy edu-
cation, pain management and 3 consecutive days of 
8-hour heat therapy (n=25). Pain intensity, pain relief 
and disability were recorded at baseline, 4 times per 
day for the 3-day treatment period and 4 and 14 days 
after enrollment. The patients in the heat wrap group 
had significantly reduced pain intensity, increased 
pain relief and improved disability scores during and 
after treatment. In critique, the work group down- Diagnosis &amp; Treatment of Low Back Pain | Recommendations | Physical Medicine &amp; Rehabilitation

Q1 Evidence Summary: 
Durmus et al16 investigated the effects of phonopho-
resis and ultrasound therapy in patients with chron-
ic LBP. Patients with LBP for at least 3 months were randomized to the control group to receive exercise only (n=20), ultrasound plus exercise (n=20), or pho-nophoresis plus exercise (n=20), 3 days a week for 6 weeks. Pain (VAS), disability (Oswestry Disabili-ty Questionnaire and pain disability index), walking performance, depression (Beck Depression Inventory scores), quality of life (SF-36), and muscle strength and endurance were recorded before and after treat-ment. All groups had improvements in outcomes. The ultrasound and phonophoresis groups had statistical-ly significant greater improvements in pain, walking performance and extensor muscle strength compared to the control group, although not necessarily clini-cally important improvement. The authors concluded that both ultrasound and phonophoresis were effec-tive treatments for patients with chronic LBP. Base-line impairment was mild and sample size was small. This study provides Level II therapeutic evidence that, in patients with LBP, addition of ultrasound therapy to exercise program provides questionable immediate clinically-important reduction in pain, but not dis-ability compared to exercise alone.

were instructed to perform a semi-supervised exer-cise program consisting of stretching and strengthen-ing exercises daily during the trial and for one month after treatment. Functional disability (Functional Rating Index) and global pain (VAS) were among the outcomes measured upon enrollment, after treatment and after one-month follow-up. Intention-to-treat analysis found that both groups experienced im-proved function and pain. The Time x Group inter-actions for pain and function were not statistically significant. The main effect of Group on Functional Rating Index was significant. The authors concluded that continuous ultrasound added to an exercise pro-gram improved function, lumbar range of motion and endurance time.

Q1 Evidence Summary:
Herman et al18 conducted a randomized controlled 
trial to evaluate the effectiveness of a standard ex-ercise program with or without transcutaneous elec-trical nerve stimulation (TENS) in patients with in-dustry-related acute LBP. Patients with LBP from a work-related injury with a duration of 3-10 weeks were randomized to receive TENS (n=29) or placebo stimulation (n=29) in addition to an exercise pro-gram. Disability (Roland-Morris disability question-naire) and pain (VAS) were recorded before and after each treatment session and 4 weeks after enrollment. Return to work was assessed at 5 weeks and 6 months after enrollment. There were no significant differ-ences in outcomes between groups. The authors con-cluded that there were no additional benefits of TENS when added to an exercise program. This study was limited by significant number of dropouts. This study provides Level II evidence that there are no additional benefits from TENS when added to exercise treatment for industrial-related LBP. 
In a randomized controlled trial, Weiner et al

ied the effectiveness of percutaneous electrical nerve 
stimulation (PENS) for the treatment of chronic LBP. Patients with LBP for at least 3 months were random-ized to receive twice-weekly PENS (n=17) or sham PENS (n=17) in addition to physical therapy for 6 weeks.

The patients who received PENS had statistically sig-
nificant reductions in pain intensity and disability at 
both follow-up points, while the sham PENS group 
did not. The study was limited by a small sample size. 
This study provides Level II evidence that percutane-
ous electrical nerve stimulation added to an exercise 
program resulted in significant improvement in pain 
and function at 3 months in geriatric patients with 
chronic LBP. 
Weiner et al20 investigated the effectiveness of per-
cutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (PENS) for the 
treatment of chronic LBP in a randomized controlled 
trial. Patients with chronic LBP were randomized to 
receive one of 4 treatments twice weekly for 6 weeks: 
PENS (n=50), control-PENS (n=50), PENS plus gen-
eral conditioning and aerobic exercise (n=50), or 
control-PENS plus general conditioning and aerobic 
exercise (n=50). Control-PENS consisted of brief elec-
trical stimulation. Pain (McGill Pain Questionnaire) 
and disability (Roland Morris Questionnaire) were 
recorded at baseline, within one week of completing 
the intervention and 6 months after completing the 
intervention. All groups experienced improved pain 
and disability at 6 months. The authors concluded 
that the exact dose of electrical stimulation required 
for analgesia cannot be determined. This study pro-
vides Level I evidence that PENS and a modified PENS 
as the sham resulted in significant improvements in 
pain and function that did not improve with exercise 
in a geriatric population with chronic LBP at 6 months 
follow-up, although the addition of exercise did seem 
to improve fear avoidance in particular.
Deyo et al21 compared the effect of transcutaneous 
electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), a program of 
stretching exercises, or a combination of both for the 
treatment of chronic LBP. Patients with LBP for at least 
3 months were randomized to receive TENS (n=36), 
sham TENS (n=36), TENS plus exercises (n=37), or 
sham TENS plus exercises (n=36). Patients assigned 
to TENS received instructions for home-use of at least 
3 45-minute TENS sessions per day. Patients allocat-
ed to receive exercise received instructions for a daily 
structured exercise sequence, adding one new exer-
cise each day. Functional status (modified Sickness 
Impact Profile), self-reported activity level, pain (or-
dinal and VAS for pain, improvement and frequency) 
pain scale) and physical measures were recorded at 
baseline, after 2 and 4 weeks of therapy and 2-month 
follow-up after completion of the trial. There were 
no significant differences in outcomes in those who 
received TENS and no interactive effect of TENS with 
exercise. The authors concluded that TENS is no more effective than placebo and adds no additional benefit 
to exercise alone. This study provides Level I thera-
peutic evidence that TENS does not provide improve-
ment in pain in patients with chronic LBP.
In a randomized double-blind crossover study, 
Jarzem et al22 compared transcutaneous electrical 
nerve stimulation (TENS) to sham therapy in pa-
tients with chronic LBP. Patients with LBP for at least 
3 months were randomized to receive TENS followed 
by 2 treatments of sham TENS (n=25) or sham treat-
ment followed by 2 treatments of conventional TENS 
(n=25). Pain tolerance (VAS) and physical measure-
ments were recorded upon enrollment and within an 
hour after each treatment. There were significant im-
provements in pain and physical measurements after 
TENS compared to sham treatment. These measure-
ments were usually done within an hour of treatment. 
Durable effects from treatment were not evaluated. 
The authors concluded that TENS significantly re-
duces pain and improves physical performance on the 
studied measurements and should be considered for 
short-term pain relief. This study offers Level I ther-
apeutic evidence that TENS provides immediate relief 
in patients with chronic LBP.
Marchand et al23 aimed to compare the effect of 
transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), 
placebo-TENS and no treatment in patients with 
chronic LBP. Patients with LBP for more than 6 months 
were allocated into one of 3 groups using a pseudo-
random assignment to control for sex, weight, 
diagnosis and pain severity. Patients presented 
to the clinic twice weekly for ten weeks to receive 
TENS (n=14), placebo-TENS (n=12), or no treatment 
(n=16). Pain intensity and unpleasantness (VAS) were 
recorded before and after each treatment, as well as 
every two hours at home during 3-day periods before 
treatment, 1 week after treatment and 3 and 6 months 
after treatment. Both TENS and placebo-TENS reduced 
pain intensity and unpleasantness. TENS reduced 
pain intensity significantly more than placebo-TENS 
immediately after treatment sessions and one week 
after sessions, but not 3 months or 6 months after. 
The authors concluded that TENS should be used as 
a short-term treatment as part of a multidisciplinary 
program for LBP. In critique of the methodology, this 
potential Level I study was downgraded due to small 
sample size. This study provides Level II therapeutic 
evidence that TENS provides immediate term pain 
relief in patients with chronic LBP.

neous spinal electroanalgesia (TSE) in patients with 
LBP. Patients with LBP for greater than one year were 
randomized to blindly receive a single 20-minute 
treatment of TSE (n=29) or sham treatment (n=29). 
Pain (VAS) was recorded every day of the week pri-
or to and following treatment as well as immediate-
ly before and after the treatment session. There were 
no significant differences in pain scores between TSE 
and sham after treatment. The authors concluded that 
a single 20-minute treatment of TSE does not signifi-cantly impact pain in patients with LBP. This tech-
nique has some similarity to TENS, but can be run at 
higher frequencies. This study is limited by the fact 
that patients received only one dose. This study pro-

of transcutaneous spinal electroanalgesia did result in 
short-term pain relief when compared to placebo in

ability were recorded at baseline and at the end of the 
6-week treatment period and pain was also evaluated 
at 6 months follow-up after completion along with a 
global assessment. Baseline pain (5.2 to 6.2) and dis-
ability scores (25 to 35) were moderate. Forty-five out 
of 50 patients in each group were evaluated at the fi-
nal follow-up. All participants experienced improve-
ments in outcomes, but there were no significant dif-ferences between groups. Improvements were modest 
and not clinically important for functional scores. The 
authors concluded that laser acupuncture does not 
have a specific effect for the treatment of chronic LBP. 
This study offers Level I therapeutic evidence that for 
patients with chronic and moderately severe LBP, la-
ser acupuncture provides no benefit over sham treat-
ment at short-term follow-up.
Glazov et al26 later conducted another double-blind 
controlled trial to investigate the effect of different 
doses of laser acupuncture in reducing pain and dis-
ability in patients with chronic LBP. Patients with LBP 
for at least 3 months were randomized to receive one 
session per week for 8 weeks of high-dose (0.8 Joules/ Diagnosis &amp; Treatment of Low Back Pain | Recommendations | Physical Medicine &amp; Rehabilitation

point) laser acupuncture (n=48) or sham (0 Joules/
point) laser acupuncture (n=48). Treatment was pro-
vided by experienced general practitioners at six dif-
ferent general practices. Pain (Numerical Pain Rating 
Scale) and disability (Oswestry Disability Inventory) 
were recorded at baseline, one and 6 weeks into the 
treatment period and 6 months post-treatment. Pain 
was also recorded 12 months post treatment. Baseline pain (means 4.9 to 5.3) and function (mean ODI 26 to 
27) scores were moderate. Final analysis was done for 
42, 40 and 45 patients respectively. All groups experi-
enced improvements in pain and disability, but there 
were no differences in outcomes between groups. Im-
provements in function were statistically significant, 
but not clinically important. This study offers Level I 
therapeutic evidence that laser acupuncture provides 
no short- or medium-term benefit over sham treat-
ment in patients with moderately severe chronic LBP.
It is suggested that the combination of laser therapy (low-level or high-level) with exercise pro-
vides better short-term relief of pain than either exercise or laser therapy alone.

There is conflicting evidence that the combination of laser therapy with exercise provides bet -
ter short-term improvement in function compared to exercise or laser therapy alone.

Alayat et al27 compared the effect of high-intensity la-
ser therapy (HILT) in patients with chronic LBP in a 
randomized controlled trial. Patients in the male sec-
tion of a single rehabilitation department with LBP for 
at least one year were randomized to receive twelve 
15-minute sessions over 4 weeks of HILT plus a home 
exercise program to be completed twice daily for 4 
weeks (n=28), placebo laser plus exercise (n=24), 
or HILT alone (n=20). Range of motion, pain (VAS), 
functional disability (Roland Morris Disability Ques-
tionnaire and Modified Oswestry Disability Question-
naire) were recorded at baseline, after the 4-week 
treatment period and at 12-week follow-up from the 
start of treatment. All groups experienced improved 
pain and disability, with no significant differences 
in disability between groups. The HILT plus exercise 
group experienced a clinically meaningful and statis-
tically significantly greater decrease in pain compared 
to the HILT only group. The authors concluded that 
HILT combined with exercise is more effective than 
HILT or exercise alone for the treatment of chron-
ic LBP. The study is limited by potential problems 
with compliance with home exercise program and its 
short duration of follow-up (8 weeks after conclusion 
of treatment). This study offers Level I therapeutic 
evidence that combination of high-intensity laser 
therapy (HILT) plus exercise provides short-term in-
creased pain relief and function as compared to HILT or home exercise alone. Home exercise alone provides 
increased pain relief but no difference in function over 
HILT alone.
Djavid et al28 conducted a randomized trial to investi-
gate the effect of low-level laser therapy for the treat-
ment of chronic LBP. Patients referred to a single oc-
cupational medicine department with LBP for at least 
12 weeks were randomized to receive laser therapy 
(n=20), laser therapy plus exercise (n=21) or placebo 
laser therapy plus exercise (n=20). The exercise pro-
gram consisted of a home program of strengthening, 
stretching, mobilizing and stabilization exercises. La-
ser therapy was performed twice weekly for 6 weeks. 
Pain severity (VAS), range of motion and disability 
(Oswestry Disability Index) was recorded at baseline, 
immediately following the 6-week treatment peri-
od and 6 weeks after completion of the trial. Baseline 
disability was moderate (ODI low 30s). There were 8 
dropouts and no power analysis was done for sample 
size. There were no significant differences in out-
comes between laser therapy alone and exercise plus 
sham. At 12 weeks (6 weeks following conclusion of 
treatment), the laser therapy plus exercise group had 
significantly improved pain, range of motion and dis-
ability compared to the exercise plus sham group. The 
authors concluded that low-level laser therapy plus 
exercise is more beneficial than exercise plus sham.  Diagnosis &amp; Treatment of Low Back Pain | Recommendations | Physical Medicine &amp; Rehabilitation

The study was downgraded for small effect size and 
small sample size. This study provides Level II ther-
apeutic evidence that, at short-term follow-up, laser 
plus exercise provided more pain relief and improved disability compared to exercise plus sham laser. There 
is no short-term benefit of low-level laser alone as 
compared to exercise plus sham laser.

Q1 Recommendation:        
In patients with subacute or chronic low back pain, traction is not recommended to provide 
clinically significant improvements in pain or function.
 Grade of Recommendation: A  
Q1 Evidence Summary: 
Borman, et al29 conducted a randomized controlled 
study to determine the efficacy of traction in the 
treatment of LBP. Patients with LBP for at least 6 
weeks were randomized to receive ten sessions of 
standard physical therapy of heat, ultrasound and 
active exercise (n=21) or standard physical therapy 
with conventional lumbar traction (n=21). Disability 
(Oswestry Disability Index) and pain (VAS) were 
recorded at baseline, at the end of the intervention 
and 3-month follow-up. Both groups experienced 
improvement in pain and disability after treatment, 
with no significant differences between groups. 
The authors concluded that traction has no specific 
effect on standard physical therapy. The work group 
downgraded this potential Level I study during 
critique of the methodology due to small sample 
size and for 35% of participants receiving another 
treatment during the 3-month follow-up period. 
This study provides Level II evidence that there was 
no efficacy in adding traction to a standard physical 
therapy protocol of passive and active intervention. Diab et al30 investigated the effect of lumbar ex-
tension traction on pain, function and whole spine 
sagittal balance in patients with chronic LBP. Pa-
tients with LBP for greater than three months were 
randomly allocated to a control group (n=40) to re-
ceive stretching exercises and infrared radiation or a 
traction group (n=40) to receive 3 sessions a week of 
lumbar extension traction for 10 weeks in addition to 
the same stretching exercises and infrared radiation. 
Pain (Back Pain Rating Scale), disability (Oswestry 
Disability Index) and radiological spine sagittal bal-
ance parameters were recorded at baseline, after the 
10-week treatment period and 6-month follow-up. 
Their primary measure was radiographic outcomes. 
There were significant differences in pain and dis-
ability at 6-month follow-up, but not immediately 
after the 10-week treatment period. However, the ac-
tual change in lordosis was 4° and sacral slope 1° with 
substantial overlap in standard deviations. Mean ODI 
scores (32 and 31) and pain scores (6 and 5.5) revealed 
moderate severity. There were improvements in both  Diagnosis &amp; Treatment of Low Back Pain | Recommendations | Physical Medicine &amp; Rehabilitation

groups and while statistically different, the differ-
ences do not appear to be clinically important. The 
authors concluded that the addition of lumbar ex-
tension to stretching exercises and infrared radiation 
resulted in improvements in spine sagittal balance 
parameters, pain and disability. This study provides 
Level I evidence that extension traction added to an 
exercise program and infrared heat to treat patients 
with chronic LBP with moderate pain and disability 
results in statistically better but clinically insignifi-
cant improvement in pain and disability at 6-month 
follow-up. 
  
Schimmel et al31 conducted a randomized controlled 
trial to study the effect of adding Intervertebral Dif-
ferential Dynamics (IDD) therapy to standard grad-
ed activity program for the treatment of chronic LBP. 
Patients with LBP for more than 3 months were ran-
domized to receive sham therapy (n=29) or IDD Ther-apy which included intermittent traction sessions in 
the AccuSPINA device (n=31). During the first 6 weeks, 
all participants received 20 sessions of their assigned 
sham or IDD Therapy. A standard graded activity pro-
gram was added after two weeks for both groups and 
consisted of one-hour sessions twice weekly for 12 
weeks. Pain (100-mm VAS), disability (Oswestry Dis-
ability Index), quality of life (SF-36) and fear of move-
ment (Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia) were recorded 
upon enrollment and 2, 6 and 14 weeks after initiation 
of the treatment. Improvements in outcomes were 
seen in both groups. The authors concluded that the 
addition of intermittent, mechanical traction added 
to standard graded activity is not effective. This study 
provides Level I evidence that the addition of inter-
mittent traction with the AccuSPINA device versus 
sham when coupled with graded activity does not re-
sult in improved pain or disability scores in patients 
with chronic LBP at short-term follow-up.

Patients (men only) with LBP for at least 12 weeks 
were randomized to receive standard therapy plus dry 
needling 1-2 times per week at muscle motor points (n=29) or standard therapy alone (n=27). Standard 
therapy included physiotherapy, exercise and occu-
pational therapy. Pain and work status were classified 
as 0 (no improvement), + (some improvement), ++ 
(good improvement) or +++ (total improvement). The 
patient’s status was recorded at baseline, at time of 
discharge, 12 weeks post-discharge and again when  Diagnosis &amp; Treatment of Low Back Pain | Recommendations | Physical Medicine &amp; Rehabilitation

contacted at the time of writing the report (12-61 
weeks, average 27.3 weeks). The group that received 
dry needling in addition to standard therapy signifi-
cantly improved compared to standard therapy alone 
at time of discharge and both follow-up points. The 
authors concluded that the addition of dry needling 
to standard care seems justified for the treatment of 
chronic LBP in patients with myofascial pain. In cri-
tique, study outcome measures are poorly defined and 
not validated. Sample size was small without pow-er analysis. This was a mix of subacute patients with 
symptoms present for as little as 12 weeks combined 
with patients that had symptoms for years, with a 
mean of 27 weeks. Lastly the randomization was con-
strained to randomization in blocks of 2. Due to flaws 
in randomization methodology, the study started as a 
Level II design and was downgraded to Level III. This 
study offers Level III therapeutic evidence that, in pa-
tients with LBP, addition of dry needling to a compre-
hensive exercise program results in greater improve-
ment than exercise alone.

Q1 Recommendations (sham acupuncture): 
In patients with low back pain, there is conflicting evidence that acupuncture provides improve-
ments in pain and function as compared to sham acupuncture. 
 Grade of Recommendation: I  
Q1 Evidence Summary (sham acupuncture): 
Carlsson et al33 conducted a blinded placebo-controlled 
study to investigate the effect of needle acupuncture 
on long-term relief of chronic LBP. Patients with 
LBP for at least 6 months were randomized to receive 
needle acupuncture (n=34) or placebo stimulation 
using a disconnected transcutaneous electrical nerve 
stimulation stimulator (n=16) once weekly for 8 weeks 
plus 2 additional treatments over a 6-month follow-
up. Pain intensity (VAS), analgesic intake, quality of 
sleep and activity level were recorded in a diary. An 
independent blinded observer completed a global 
assessment at 1, 3 and 6 months after treatment. A 
significantly greater proportion of the patients in the 
acupuncture group had improved global assessments 
at 1- and 6-month follow-up. There were significant 
improvements in mean weekly pain scores, return 
to work, quality of sleep and analgesic intake in the 
acupuncture group compared to the placebo group. 
The authors concluded that needle acupuncture 
provides long-term pain-relieving effect in some 
patients with chronic nociceptive LBP. Due to the small 
sample size of the study, the level of evidence was 
downgraded. This potential Level I study offers Level 
II therapeutic evidence that, in patients with chronic 
LBP, acupuncture was associated with improvement 
in return to work, quality of sleep and analgesic 
intake at 6 months compared to placebo; acupuncture 
was associated with statistically significant, but 
not clinically meaningful, improvement in pain at 6 
months compared to placebo. 
Kerr et al34 investigated the effect of acupuncture 
for the treatment of chronic LBP in a randomized 
controlled trial. Patients with LBP for more than 6 
months were randomized to receive acupuncture 
therapy (n=30) or placebo transcutaneous electrical 
nerve stimulation (n=30) for 6 weeks. Pain (McGill 
Pain Questionnaire and VAS), quality of life (SF-36) and range of motion were recorded at baseline, after 
completion of the 6-week treatment and 6 months 
after treatment. Both groups had improvements in all 
outcomes (with the exception of McGill Pain Ques-
tionnaire in the placebo group). The authors conclud-
ed that there were no significant differences between 
acupuncture therapy and placebo. In critique, less 
than 80% of patients completed follow-up and there 
was concern for Type II error due to small sample size. 
Due to these reasons, the work group downgraded the 
level of evidence for this study. This potential Level I 
study provides Level II therapeutic evidence that, in 
patients with chronic LBP, there were no differences 
in pain and function between acupuncture and place-
bo at 6 months. 
Vas et al35 conducted a multicenter randomized 
controlled trial to investigate the efficacy of 
acupuncture in patients with acute  nonspecific 
LBP. Patients with their first episode of LBP, with 
a duration of less than 2 weeks, were randomized 
into one of 4 groups: conventional treatment alone 
(n=70), conventional treatment plus acupuncture 
(n=68), conventional treatment plus sham 
acupuncture (n=68), or conventional treatment 
plus placebo acupuncture (n=69). Conventional 
treatment consisted of posture recommendations, 
analgesics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs 
and myorelaxant drugs). Each acupuncture group 
received 5 20-minute sessions over a 2-week period. 
Disability (Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire), 
pain intensity (VAS), occupational disability, LBP 
persistence, appearance of LBP and patient-perceived 
improvement were recorded at baseline and at 3, 12 and 
48 weeks. All 3 acupuncture groups (true acupuncture, 
sham and placebo) improved significantly more 
than conventional treatment alone; but there were 
no significant differences between the acupuncture 
groups. The authors concluded that acupuncture is not  Diagnosis &amp; Treatment of Low Back Pain | Recommendations | Physical Medicine &amp; Rehabilitation

better than sham or placebo acupuncture. This study 
offers Level I therapeutic evidence that, in patients 
with acute LBP, acupuncture, sham acupuncture, 
placebo acupuncture and conventional treatment 
provide similar functional outcomes at 48 weeks 
follow-up.  
Cho et al36 conducted a randomized sham-controlled 
clinical trial to study the effect of individualized acu-
puncture for the treatment of chronic LBP. Patients 
with LBP for at least three months were randomized 
to receive twice-weekly sessions of individualized 
acupuncture (n=65) or sham acupuncture (n=65). LBP 
bothersomeness (VAS), pain intensity (VAS), disabil-
ity (Oswestry Disability Index), general health status 
(Short-Form-36) and depression (Beck Depression 
Inventory) were recorded at baseline and at 3- and 
6-month follow-ups. Disability, depression and gen-
eral health status improved in both groups with no 
differences between groups. LBP intensity and both-
ersomeness improved significantly more in the indi-
vidualized acupuncture group than the sham group. 
The authors concluded that acupuncture is more ef-
fective in reducing LBP bothersomeness and inten-
sity compared to sham acupuncture in patients with 
chronic LBP. This study provides Level I therapeutic 
evidence that, in patients with LBP, acupuncture is 
more effective than sham acupuncture for pain relief 
at 6 months with no difference for function or depres-
sion.  
Cherkin et al37 compared the effectiveness of individ-
ualized acupuncture, standardized acupuncture, sim-
ulated acupuncture and usual care for the treatment 
of chronic LBP. Patients with LBP for at least 3 months 
were randomized to receive 10 15-20 minute sessions 
over 7 weeks of individualized acupuncture with no 
limits on number of needs, depth of insertion or nee-
dle manipulation (n=157), standardized acupuncture (n=158), simulated acupuncture using a toothpick in a 
needle guide tube (n=162), or usual care per the discre-
tion of their physician (n=161). Back-related dysfunc-
tion (Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire) and 
symptom bothersomeness were recorded at baseline 
and after 8, 26 and 52 weeks. All 3 acupuncture groups 
had significantly greater improvement in mean dys-
function scores at 8 weeks compared to usual care. 
The authors concluded that individualizing acupunc-
ture does not affect therapeutic benefits. This study 
provides Level I therapeutic evidence that, in patients 
with LBP, acupuncture and sham acupuncture provide 
statistically significant, but not clinically meaningful, 
improvement in function.
In a randomized controlled trial, Haake et al38 studied 
the effect of acupuncture for reducing chronic 
LBP compared to conventional therapy or sham 
acupuncture. Patients with LBP for at least six months 
were randomized to receive 10 30-minute sessions 
of verum acupuncture (n=387), sham acupuncture 
avoiding all verum points or medians (n=387) or 
guideline-based conventional therapy including 
exercise or physiotherapy sessions with a physician 
or physiotherapist (n=388). Pain (Von Korff Chronic 
Pain Grade Scale) and functional status (Hanover 
Functional Ability Questionnaire) were assessed at 
baseline and 1.5, 3 and 6 months after start of treatment. 
Both the verum and sham acupuncture groups had 
greater improvements than the conventional therapy, 
with no differences between verum and sham 
acupuncture. The authors concluded that verum and 
sham acupuncture improved LBP for at least 6 months 
with greater effectiveness than conventional therapy. 
This study provides Level I therapeutic evidence 
that, in patients with LBP, acupuncture and sham 
acupuncture result in improved pain and function at 
6 months compared to guideline-based conventional 
therapy (physical therapy).  Diagnosis &amp; Treatment of Low Back Pain | Recommendations | Physical Medicine &amp; Rehabilitation

In patients with chronic low back pain, addition of acupuncture to usual care is recommended 
for short-term improvement of pain and function compared to usual care alone. 
 Grade of Recommendation: A  
Q1 Evidence Summary (usual care): 
In a randomized controlled trial, Haake et al38 stud-
ied the effect of acupuncture for reducing chronic LBP 
compared to conventional therapy or sham acupunc-
ture. Patients with LBP for at least 6 months were ran-
domized to receive 10 30-minute sessions of verum 
acupuncture (n=387), sham acupuncture avoiding all 
verum points or medians (n=387), or guideline-based 
conventional therapy including exercise or physio-
therapy sessions with a physician or physiotherapist 
(n=388). Pain (Von Korff Chronic Pain Grade Scale) 
and functional status (Hanover Functional Ability 
Questionnaire) were assessed at baseline and 1.5, 3 
and 6 months after start of treatment. Both the verum 
and sham acupuncture groups had greater improve-
ments than the conventional therapy, with no dif-
ferences between verum and sham acupuncture. The 
authors concluded that verum and sham acupuncture 
improved LBP for at least 6 months with greater ef-
fectiveness than conventional therapy. This study 
provides Level I therapeutic evidence that, in patients 
with LBP, acupuncture and sham acupuncture result 
in improved pain and function at 6 months compared 
to guideline-based conventional therapy (physical 
therapy). 
Witt et al39 compared the effectiveness and cost of 
acupuncture in addition to routine care for chronic LBP 
in a randomized controlled trial and nonrandomized 
cohort. Patients with LBP for more than 6 months 
were randomized to receive up to 15 sessions of 
acupuncture in addition to routine medical care 
(n=1,549) or routine medical care alone (n=1,544). 
Patients who did not agree to participate in the RCT 
were enrolled in a nonrandomized acupuncture group 
(n=8,537). Back function (Hannover Functional 
Ability Questionnaire), pain (Low Back Pain Rating 
Scale) and quality of life (SF-36) were assessed at 
baseline and after 3 and 6 months. Back function, 
back pain and quality of life improved significantly 
more in the acupuncture group compared to the 
control group at 3-month follow-up. The cost-
effectiveness analysis revealed that acupuncture was 
relatively cost-effective. The authors concluded that 
acupuncture added to routine care was associated 
with clinical improvements. This study provides Level I therapeutic evidence that, at 3 months, acupuncture 
shows improvement in pain and function compared to 
routine care (routine care not defined); these results 
were not sustained at 6 months.
Yeung et al40 conducted a randomized controlled trial 
to investigate the effect of electro-acupuncture added 
to exercise for the treatment of chronic LBP. Patients 
with LBP for at least 6 months were randomized to 
receive one hour per week of a standard group exercise 
program (n=26) or the same exercise program plus 12 
sessions of electro-acupuncture (n=26) for 4 weeks. 
Pain (Numerical Rating Scale), disability (Aberdeen 
LBP scale), range of motions and isokinetic strength 
were assessed at baseline, immediately after treatment 
and at one- and 3-month follow-up. The patients 
who received the additional electro-acupuncture 
had significantly better pain and disability scores 
compared to those who had exercise only. The authors 
concluded that the addition of electro-acupuncture to 
exercise might be an effective treatment for chronic 
LBP. This study provides Level I therapeutic evidence 
that, at 3 months, in patients with LBP, electro-
acupuncture added to an exercise program improves 
pain and function better than an exercise program 
alone.
Yun et al41 aimed to determine if Hegu acupuncture 
is more effective than standard acupuncture and if 
both forms of acupuncture are more effective than

were randomized to receive 18 treatments of Hegu 
acupuncture (n=64), standard acupuncture (n=60), or 
usual care only (n=63) over 7 weeks. Hegu acupuncture 
involved inserting and drawing back the needle in 
different directions before inserting straight to the de 
qi point compared to standard acupuncture in which 
the acupuncturist inserted the needle straight to the 
de qi point. The participants in the usual care did not 
receive any treatment but were allowed to continue 
any care recommended by their own physicians.

Both acupuncture groups had greater improvements 
in dysfunction and pain compared to the usual care 
group at both follow-up points. This study provides 
Level I therapeutic evidence that, at 48 weeks, Hegu acupuncture is associated with statistically significant 
improvements in pain and disability compared 
to standard acupuncture and provide statistically 
significant improvements in pain and disability 
compared to usual care. These improvements are 
small and may not be clinically significant.

Q1 Evidence Summary (acupuncture technique):
Ceccherelli et al42 compared the effect of superficial 
and in-depth insertion of acupuncture needs in 
treatment of chronic LBP in a randomized double-
blind study. Patients with lumbar myofascial pain for 
more than three months were randomized to receive 
8 sessions of acupuncture using either a 2 mm depth 
(n=21) or deep placement into the muscular tissue 
(n=21). Pain intensity (McGill Pain Questionnaire) 
was recorded at baseline, after the 6-week treatment 
period and at 3-month follow-up. The patients who 
received deep acupuncture had significantly greater 
pain reduction compared to the superficial insertion at 
3-month follow-up. The authors concluded that deep 
stimulation has better pain relief effects compared 
to superficial stimulation. This study offers Level I 
therapeutic evidence that, in patients with LBP, deep 
acupuncture provided more pain relief at 3 months 
compared to superficial acupuncture. 
Pach et al43 conducted a randomized controlled trial 
to compare the effectiveness of standardized and in-
dividualized acupuncture for the treatment of chronic 
LBP. Patients with LBP for at least 3 months were ran-
domized to receive 10-15 sessions of standardized acu-
puncture (n=78) or individualized acupuncture based 
on diagnosis (n=72) over 8 weeks. Pain (VAS) was re-
corded in a daily diary. Both groups had improvement 
in pain severity over 8 weeks, with no differences in 
the area under the curve for pain severity from base-
line to end of week 8. The authors concluded that in-
dividualized acupuncture was not superior to standard 
acupuncture. This study offers Level I therapeutic ev-
idence that, in patients with LBP, outcomes for stan-
dard and individualized acupuncture are equivalent. 
This study offers Level IV therapeutic evidence that 
acupuncture results in significant pain relief. Shin et al44 compared the effect of bee venom acu-
puncture and sham control for the treatment of 
chronic LBP. Patients with LBP for at least 3 months 
were randomized to receive twice-weekly treatments 
of bee venom acupuncture (n=30) or sham control of 
normal saline injection (n=30) for four weeks. Pain 
intensity (VAS), disability (Oswestry Disability Ques-
tionnaire) and quality of life (SF-36) were record-
ed at baseline, at each treatment session and 4- and 
12-month follow-up after completion of treatment. 
Both groups had significant improvement in pain in-
tensity, disability and quality of life at all follow-up 
points with no significant differences between groups 
in disability or quality of life. At the 7th and 8th treat-
ment sessions, the participants in the bee venom acu-
puncture group had significantly greater pain relief 
compared to the control group, but there were no dif-
ferences at 4- or 12-month follow-up. Adverse events 
such as pruritus and other skin reactions occurred but 
resolved without medical intervention. The authors 
concluded that bee venom acupuncture is effective in 
treating chronic LBP. This study provides Level I ther-
apeutic evidence that, in patients with LBP, bee ven-
om acupuncture and saline acupuncture are equally 
effective in pain relief similar at 3 months’ follow-up. 
Yun et al41 aimed to determine is Hegu acupuncture is 
more effective than standard acupuncture and if both 
forms of acupuncture are more effective than medical 
care alone for the treatment of chronic LBP. Patients 
with back pain for at least three months were random-
ized to receive 18 treatments of Hegu acupuncture, 
standard acupuncture, or usual care only over sev-
en weeks. Hegu acupuncture involved inserting and 
drawing back the needle in different directions before 
inserting straight to the de qi point compared to stan- Diagnosis &amp; Treatment of Low Back Pain | Recommendations | Physical Medicine &amp; Rehabilitation

dard acupuncture in which the acupuncturist inserted 
the needle straight to the de qi point. The participants 
in the usual care did not receive any treatment but 
were allowed to continue any care recommended by 
their own physicians. Back-related dysfunction (Ro-
land-Morris Disability Questionnaire) and pain (VAS) 
were recorded at baseline and at 8 and 48 weeks after 
enrollment. The Hegu acupuncture group had greater 
improvements in dysfunction and pain scores com-
pared to the standard acupuncture group at both fol-
low-up points. Both acupuncture groups had greater improvements in dysfunction and pain compared to 
the usual care group at both follow-up points. This 
study provides Level I therapeutic evidence that, at 48 
weeks, Hegu acupuncture is associated with statisti-
cally significant, but not clinically meaningful, im-
provements in pain and disability compared to stan-
dard acupuncture; both types of acupuncture provide 
statistically significant, but not clinically meaning-
ful improvements in pain and disability compared to 
usual care.

Q1 Evidence Summary:
Calmels et al45 investigated the effects of an elastic 
lumbar belt for the treatment of LBP in a multicenter, 
randomized controlled trial. Patients with a current 
LBP episode lasting 1-3 months were randomly as-
signed to receive a lumbar belt (n=102) or to a con-
trol group instructed not to wear any type of lumbar 
belt (n=95). Participants who received the lumbar belt were instructed to wear the belt every day for 
the duration of the 3-month trial. Pain (VAS), func-
tional capacity (EIFEL scale, French version of the 
Roland-Morris scale) and number of days of medical 
consumption were recorded at baseline and on day 
30, 60 and 90. The lumbar belt group had statistically 
significant improvements in pain, functional capacity  Diagnosis &amp; Treatment of Low Back Pain | Recommendations | Physical Medicine &amp; Rehabilitation

and medication consumption. The authors conclud-
ed that the addition of a lumbar belt can improve the 
functional status, pain level and pharmacologic con-
sumption in patients with subacute LBP. Although the 
differences between groups were statistically signif-
icant, in critique, the work group deemed the results 
clinically insignificant. This study offers Level I ther-
apeutic evidence that, in patients with subacute LBP, 
there does not appear to be a clinically significant 
difference in pain and function at 3 months between 
wearing a nonrigid lumbar corset and medication. 
Oleske et al46 conducted a multicenter randomized 
clinical trial to compare the effectiveness of a back 
support lumbar corset plus education versus education 
alone in patients with LBP. Patients with work-
related LBP were randomized to receive education 
plus the back support corset (n=222) or education 
alone (n=211). LBP frequency and bothersomeness 
(numerical rating scale), disability (Oswestry Back 
Pain Disability Questionnaire), physical health (SF-
12), mental health and work time were recorded 
at follow-up and after 1, 2, 6 and 12 months. Both 
groups experienced improvements in pain, disability, 
neurogenic symptoms and physical health over 12 
months. The back support plus education group had 
a lower likelihood of LBP recurrence, but otherwise 
there were no differences in outcomes between 
groups. The authors concluded that the back support may prevent recurrence of work-related LBP when 
added to education. This study provides Level I 
therapeutic evidence that, in patients with subacute 
LBP, the addition of lumbar corset to education does 
not result in decreased pain and disability compared 
to education alone at one year. 
Doran and Newell47 investigated the effectiveness of 
four different treatment options in patients with LBP. 
Participants were randomly assigned to receive at 
least 2 sessions of manipulation per week (n=98), at 
least 2 sessions of physiotherapy per week (n=104), 
corset applied on the first day of the trial (n=93), or 
2 paracetamol tablets every 4 hours (n=100). Patients 
completed questionnaires to report whether their 
pain was worse, unchanged, improved or completely 
relieved at the end of the 3-week trial, 3 weeks after 
the conclusion of the trial, 3 months after enrollment 
and one year after enrollment. The authors conclud-
ed that there were no significant differences between 
any of the 4 studied interventions. In critique, no val-
idated outcomes were included in this study and out-
come data is limited. Due to these reasons, the work 
group downgraded this study. This potential Level I 
study provides Level II therapeutic evidence that, in 
patients with acute LBP, SMT, physiotherapy, medi-
cation and corset resulted in similar improvements up 
to 3 months.

v. Spinal manipulative therapy (SMT)
Work Group Narrative: The majority of SMT literature involves the centralization phenomenon which is 
commonly seen in patients with leg pain. This review examined only evidence in the sub-set of patients 
without radiating pain. Additional literature discussing clinical benefits from SMT for the treatment of 
LBP including radiating pain were not included in our systematic review. Therefore, a definitive state-
ment of SMT in all patients with LBP cannot be made.
Q1 Recommendations: 
For patients with acute or chronic low back pain, spinal manipulative therapy (SMT) is an option 
to improve pain and function. 
 Grade of Recommendation: C  
For patients with acute low back pain, spinal manipulative therapy (SMT) results in similar out -
comes to no treatment, medication or modalities. Periodically, short-term improvement is sta-
tistically better, but clinical significance is uncertain. 
 Grade of Recommendation: A  
For patients with chronic low back pain, there is conflicting evidence that outcomes for spinal 
manipulative therapy (SMT) are clinically different than no treatment, medication or modalities.
 Grade of Recommendation: I  
Q1 Evidence Summary: 
In a randomized control trial, Dougherty et al48 evalu-
ated the effectiveness of spinal manipulative therapy 
(SMT) in older veterans with chronic LBP compared to 
a sham intervention. Veterans at least 65 years of age 
with LBP for at least 3 months were randomly allo-
cated to groups to receive SMT (n=69) or sham inter-
vention (n=67) twice weekly for 4 weeks. Pain (VAS, 
SF-36 pain subscale), disability (Oswestry Disability 
Index) and physical function (SF-36 subscale, Timed 
Up and Go) were recorded at baseline and after 5 and 
12 weeks. Both groups experienced improvements in 
pain and disability at 5 and 12 weeks. Disability im-
proved significantly more in the SMT group compared 
to the control group. The authors concluded that SMT 
resulted in greater improvement in disability but not 
pain at 12 weeks. This study offers Level I therapeu-
tic evidence that, in patients with chronic LBP, there 
were similar improvements in pain when comparing 
SMT to sham. There was statistically significant im-provement in function in the SMT group. However, it 
is uncertain as to whether these functional improve-
ments were clinically significant. 
Haas et al49 conducted a randomized controlled trial 
in patients with chronic LBP to identify the dose-re-
sponse relationship between visits to a chiroprac-
tor for SMT and treatment outcomes and to compare 
treatment outcomes of manipulation versus light 
massage. Four hundred patients with  non-specific 
LBP for at least 3 months were prescribed 18 sessions 
with a chiropractor (three times a week for six weeks). 
Participants were randomized to receive either 0, 6, 
12 or 18 sessions of SMT (n=100 in each group). The 
chiropractor provided light massage for the remain-
ing sessions that did not include SMT. Pain and dis-
ability (modified Von Korff pain and disability scales) 
were recorded at baseline and throughout a 52-week 
follow-up period. Pain and disability improved in all  Diagnosis &amp; Treatment of Low Back Pain | Recommendations | Physical Medicine &amp; Rehabilitation
Recommendations were developed based on a specific definition, inclusion/exclusion criteria, and the resulting literature which excluded conditions 
such as presence of a neurological deficit or leg pain experienced below the knee, among others. Given the exclusion criteria, these guideline rec-
ommendations address a subset of low back pain care as opposed to low back pain in its entirety. This clinical guideline is not intended to be a fixed treatment protocol; it is anticipated that there will be patients who require more or less treatment than what is outlined.

groups and was sustained for 52 weeks. The greatest 
treatment effects were found from 12 sessions of SMT. 
The authors concluded that 12 SMT visits had mod-
est effects on chronic LBP outcomes compared to the 
other dose levels, but the difference was not well dis-
tinguished. This study offers Level I therapeutic evi-
dence that, in patients with LBP, spinal manipulative 
therapy is associated with statistically significant im-
provement in pain compared to light massage. How-
ever, it is uncertain whether this was clinically sig-
nificant. Regarding frequency, this study offers Level 
I therapeutic evidence that 12-18 visits of SMT were 
statistically better than 6 visits at 12-week follow-up; 
no difference between doses at one-year follow-up. 
Again, the differences were small and the clinical sig-
nificance was uncertain.
In a placebo controlled randomized trial, Hancock et 
al50 evaluated the effectiveness of nonsteroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), spinal manipulative 
therapy (SMT), or combination of NSAIDs and SMT 
for the treatment of acute LBP. Patients presenting to 
their general practitioner with LBP were randomized 
into one of 4 groups: diclofenac 50 mg twice daily and 
placebo SMT (n=60); SMT and placebo drug (n=60); 
diclofenac 50 mg twice daily and SMT (n=60); or 
double placebo (n=60) until recovery or up to 4 weeks. 
The primary outcome of “days to recovery” was 
recorded as the first pain-free day and the first of 7 
consecutive days with a pain score of 0 or 1. There were 
no significant differences in days to recovery between 
groups. The authors concluded that the addition of 
diclofenac or spinal manipulative therapy do not 
improve recovery in patients with acute LBP already 
receiving first-line care. This study offers Level I 
therapeutic evidence that, in patients with acute LBP, 
there was no difference in resolution of pain between 
spinal manipulative therapy, NSAIDS and placebo.
Hoiriis et al51 compared chiropractic adjustments 
and muscle relaxants to sham treatment and place-
bo in a randomized controlled trial of patients with 
subacute LBP. Patients with LBP for 2-6 weeks were 
randomly allocated into one of 3 groups: chiropractic 
adjustments with placebo medicine (n=50), muscle 
relaxants with sham adjustments (n=53) or place-
bo medicine with sham adjustments (n=53). Primary 
outcomes of pain (VAS), disability (Oswestry Disabili-
ty Questionnaire) and depression (Modified Zung De-
pression Scale) were assessed at baseline, 2 weeks and 
4 weeks. Patients at baseline had mild pain and dis-
ability. The chiropractic group had greater pain im-
provement compared to the control group and greater 
improvement in a secondary outcome of Global Im-pression of Severity compared to all groups. There 
were no significant differences between groups in 
other outcomes. The authors concluded that chiro-
practic treatment was more beneficial than placebo 
in reducing pain. This study offers Level I therapeu-
tic evidence that, in patients with acute LBP and mild 
baseline disability, there was statistically better im-
provement in pain with SMT, while improvements in 
function were otherwise similar relative to medica-
tion and sham groups at 4 weeks. However, the dif-
ferences across groups were small and it is uncertain 
whether these improvements in pain were clinically 
significant. 
Juni et al52 conducted a randomized controlled trial 
in patients with subacute LBP to evaluate the efficacy 
of SMT as an addition to standard care compared to 
standard care alone. Patients with acute LBP for less 
than four weeks were randomized to receive standard 
care of general advice and paracetamol, diclofenac or 
dihydrocodeine as required (n=52) or standard care 
plus SMT (n=52). Pain (11-point box scale) and anal-
gesic use were recorded throughout the 2-week trial 
and at 6-month follow-up. There were no significant 
differences in pain or analgesic use between groups. 
The authors concluded that SMT is not likely to reduce 
pain in patients with acute LBP. This study provides 
Level I therapeutic evidence that, in patients with 
acute LBP, there were no differences in pain and func-
tion between SMT and medication at up to 6 months 
follow-up.
Schneider et al53 conducted a randomized controlled 
trial in patients with acute or subacute LBP to 
evaluate manual thrust manipulation compared to 
mechanical-assisted manipulation and manipulation 
compared to usual medical care. Patients with LBP 
of less than 12 weeks duration were randomized 
into one of three groups for 4 weeks: twice-weekly 
manual-thrust manipulation (n=37), twice-weekly 
mechanical-assisted manipulation (n=35), or 3 visits 
of usual medical care (n=35). Disability (Oswestry LBP 
Disability Index) and pain (numeric pain rating scale) 
were recorded at baseline, after 4 weeks of treatment 
and at 3- and 6-month follow-up. The participants 
who received manual-thrust manipulation had 
significantly greater improvements in disability and 
pain compared to the machine-assisted manipulation 
and usual medical care at 4 weeks. There was a 
greater proportion of responders (30-50% reduction 
in Oswestry LBP Disability Index score) in the 
manual-thrust manipulation compared to machine-
assisted manipulation or usual medical care. The 
authors concluded that manual-thrust manipulation  Diagnosis &amp; Treatment of Low Back Pain | Recommendations | Physical Medicine &amp; Rehabilitation

provides greater short-term improvements in pain 
and disability compared to usual medical care or 
machine-assisted manipulation. This study offers 
Level I therapeutic evidence that, in patients with 
acute LBP, manual based SMT had significantly 
greater improvement in pain and function compared 
to mechanical assisted manipulation or usual care at 
4 weeks follow-up, but not at 3 months.
In patients with chronic LBP, Senna et al54 conduct-
ed a randomized controlled trial to compare SMT to 
sham SMT. Patients with LBP for at least 6 months 
were randomized to one of 3 groups: 12 treatments of 
sham SMT over one month (n=40), 12 treatments of 
SMT over one-month followed by no treatment for 
9 months (n=27) or 12 treatments of SMT over one 
month with “maintenance spinal manipulation” ev-
ery 2 weeks for the following 9 months (n=26). Pain 
(VAS), disability (Oswestry disability questionnaire), 
generic health status (SF-36) and back-specific pa-
tient satisfaction were recorded at baseline and after 
one, 4, 7 and 10 months. After one month, both of the 
SMT groups had significantly lower pain and disabil-
ity compared to the sham SMT group. At 10 months, 
only the maintenance SMT group had improvements 
in pain and disability. The authors concluded that 
SMT is effective for the treatment of LBP and suggest-
ed maintenance manipulation for long-term benefits. 
In critique, less than 80% of patients completed fol-
low-up. Due to this potentially confounding factor, 
the work group downgraded the level of evidence for 
this study. This potential Level I study provides Level 
II therapeutic evidence that, in patients with chron-
ic LBP, pain and function showed more improvement 
in group with maintained SMT than in the group with 
nonmaintained SMT or sham SMT at all time frames 
after one month.
In a placebo and sham randomized controlled trial, 
Von Heymann et al55 evaluated the effectiveness of 
spinal high-velocity low-amplitude manipulation 
compared to treatment with a nonsteroidal anti-
inflammatory drug. Patients with LBP for less 
than 48 hours were randomized to receive spinal 
manipulation therapy (SMT) and placebo drug 
(n=37), sham SMT and 50 mg tablets diclofenac three 
times a day (n=38), or sham SMT and placebo drug 
(n=25). Physical disability (Roland Morris Disability 
Questionnaire), function (SF-12), pain (VAS) off-
work time and rescue medication usage were recorded 
at baseline, 7-9 days after randomization and 12-
week follow-up. Both intervention groups had better 
outcomes than the placebo group. The manipulation 
group experienced faster and more distinct reduction in pain and disability compared to the diclofenac 
group. There were no adverse effects, harm or 
unexpected untoward events in either group. The 
authors concluded that SMT was significantly better 
than diclofenac and placebo in the treatment of LBP. 
This study offers Level I therapeutic evidence that, in 
patients with acute LBP, SMT resulted in statistically 
significant short-term (9 days) improvement in pain 
compared to medication. The clinical significance was 
uncertain. The two groups were similar at medium-
term follow-up.
In a randomized control trial, Grunnesjo et al56 eval-
uated muscle stretching, manual therapy and steroid 
injections in addition to staying active in patients 
with acute and subacute LBP. Participants were ran-
domized into one of 4 groups: “stay active” care only 
(n=35), “stay active” and muscle stretching (n=36), 
“stay active, muscle stretching and manual therapy 
(n=42), or “stay active,” muscle stretching, manual 
therapy and steroid injections (n=47). The “stay ac-
tive” care included some active physical therapies in 
addition to encouragement to stay physically active. 
Quality of life measurements (The Gothenburg Qual-
ity of Life instruments) were recorded at baseline, af-
ter 5 weeks of treatment and at the end of the 10-week 
trial. There was a significant trend for increasing 
well-being as additional modalities were added. The 
authors concluded that additional effects were seen 
as additional treatment modalities were added. This 
study offers Level I therapeutic evidence that, in pa-
tients with LBP, addition of manual therapy to staying 
active and stretching had similar effects on quality of 
life compared to staying active and stretching alone at 
10 weeks. 
Licciardone et al57 conducted a randomized controlled 
study to determine the efficacy of osteopathic ma-
nipulative treatment for the treatment of LBP. Pa-
tients with LBP for at least 3 months were random-
ized to receive 7 visits over 5 months of osteopathic 
manipulative treatment (n=46), sham manipulation 
(n=23), or usual care only (n=20). Pain (VAS), self-re-
ported health status (SF-36 Health Survey), disability 
(Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire), lost work/
school days and satisfaction of care were recorded. 
Follow-up was completed after one month (n=82), 3 
months (n=71) and 6 months (n=66). There were no 
significant differences in outcomes between osteo-
pathic manipulative treatment compared to sham 
manipulation; both manipulation groups experienced 
benefits compared to no intervention. The authors 
concluded that both osteopathic manipulative treat-
ment and sham manipulation provide benefits com- Diagnosis &amp; Treatment of Low Back Pain | Recommendations | Physical Medicine &amp; Rehabilitation

pared to usual care alone in patients with chronic LBP. 
In critique, the work group downgraded this study 
from Level I to Level II due to less than 80% follow-up. 
This study provides Level II therapeutic evidence that, 
in patients with subacute LBP, osteopathic manipu-
lation provides no benefit in pain or disability com-
pared with sham manipulation and that both provide 
statistically significant, but not clinically meaningful, 
improvements when compared with no care.
Cambron et al58 compared pain and disability 
outcomes in patients with chronic LBP who received 
flexion distraction chiropractic care or physical 
therapy in a randomized clinical trial. Patients with 
LBP &gt; 3 months were randomly assigned to receive 
flexion distraction chiropractic care using flexion 
distraction (n=123) or a physical therapy program 
of strength, flexibility and cardiovascular exercises 
with the goal of strengthening the trunk muscles 
(n=112). Both treatment programs were 4 weeks with 
2-4 sessions per week. Patients reported pain (VAS) 
and dysfunction (Roland Morris) at baseline and 
one-month follow-up questionnaire. Both groups 
experienced improvements in pain and disability; 
however, the pain scores were significantly lower 
in the chiropractic group compared to the physical 
therapy group. The authors concluded that flexion 
distraction was more effective in reducing pain than 
the studied physical therapy program. This study 
offers Level I therapeutic evidence that, in patients 
with chronic LBP, SMT provides similar improvement 
in pain and function compared to an exercise program 
at one year follow-up. It offers Level IV evidence that 
SMT results in improved pain and function.
Cecchi et al59 compared the effect of spinal manipu-
lation, back school and individual physiotherapy on 
pain and disability outcomes in a randomized trial of 
patients with chronic LBP. Patients were randomized 
to receive 15 one-hour sessions of back school (group 
exercise, education/ergonomics) over the course of 
3 weeks (n=70), 15 one-hour sessions of individu-
al physiotherapy (exercise, passive mobilization and 
soft-tissue treatment) over the course of 3 weeks 
(n=70), or 4-6 20-minute sessions of spinal manip-
ulation per week for 4-6 weeks (n=70). Participants 
recorded pain (Pain Rating Scale) and disability (Ro-
land Morris Disability Questionnaire) at baseline, dis-
charge and follow-up at 3, 6 and 12 months. All pa-
tients experienced improvement in pain and disability 
at discharge and 12-month follow-up. Function, pain 
recurrences and drug intake were significantly re-
duced compared to back school or physiotherapy. The 
authors concluded that spinal manipulation resulted in better improvements in pain and function com-
pared to back school or individual physiotherapy. This 
study provides Level I therapeutic evidence that, in 
patients with LBP, SMT results in statistically signif-
icant improvement in pain and functional compared 
to multimodal physical therapy (baseline scores indi-
cate mild pain). However, it is uncertain if these im-
provements are of clinical significance. It offers Lev-
el IV evidence that SMT results in improved pain and 
function.
Cherkin et al60 evaluated the different outcomes after 
patients with acute LBP received the McKenzie meth-
od of physical therapy, chiropractic manipulation or 
an educational booklet. Patients who still had LBP 7 
days after an initial visit to the primary care practi-
tioner were randomized to receive up to 8 sessions in 
a one-month period of McKenzie method of physical 
therapy (n=133), up to 8 sessions in a one-month pe-
riod of chiropractic manipulation (n=122), or an ed-
ucational booklet only (n=66). Patients reported LBP 
bothersomeness (11-point scale) and dysfunction 
(Roland Disability Scale). There were no statistically 
and clinically significant differences between groups. 
The authors concluded that the McKenzie method of 
physical therapy and chiropractic manipulation re-
sulted in similar outcomes in patients with LBP and 
were only marginally better than the educational 
booklet intervention. This study offers Level I thera-
peutic evidence that, in patients with LBP, there were 
no statistical differences in functional outcomes be-
tween educational booklet, SMT and McKenzie exer-
cise at 12 weeks. It offers Level IV evidence that SMT 
results in improved pain and function.
Doran and Newell47 investigated the effectiveness 
of four different treatment options in patients with 
acute LBP. Participants were randomly assigned to 
receive at least 2 sessions of manipulation per week 
(n=98), at least 2 sessions of physiotherapy per week 
(n=104), corset applied on the first day of the tri-
al (n=93) or two paracetamol tablets every 4 hours 
(n=100). Patients completed questionnaires to report 
whether their pain was worse, unchanged, improved, 
or completely relieved at the end of the 3-week trial, 
3 weeks after the conclusion of the trial, 3 months af-
ter enrollment and one year after enrollment. The au-
thors concluded that there were no significant differ-
ences between any of the four studied interventions. 
In critique, no validated outcomes were included in 
this study and outcome data is limited. Due to these 
reasons, the work group downgraded this study. This 
potential Level I study provides Level II therapeutic 
evidence that, in patients with acute LBP, SMT, phys- Diagnosis &amp; Treatment of Low Back Pain | Recommendations | Physical Medicine &amp; Rehabilitation

iotherapy, medication and corset resulted in similar 
improvements up to 3 months. 
In a randomized controlled trial, Enix et al61 aimed 
to compare chiropractic care and physical therapy 
as treatments for chronic LBP in geriatric patients. 
Participants aged 60-85 years with LBP were ran-
domized to receive 6 weeks (12-18 sessions) of either 
chiropractic care (n=61) or physical therapy (n=57). 
Patients completed pain questionnaires at baseline, 
at the end of the 6-week trial and 6 weeks after trial 
completion (week 12). Both groups experienced sig-
nificant improvements in pain. The authors conclud-
ed that there were no differences in pain outcomes 
between groups at 6- or 12-week follow-up. This 
study offers Level I therapeutic evidence that, in geri-
atric patients with chronic LBP, physical therapy and 
SMT resulted in similar improvement in pain relief 
at 6 weeks’ follow-up (baseline scores indicate mild 
pain). It offers Level IV evidence that SMT results in 
improved pain and function.
Hemmila et al62 conducted a randomized controlled 
trial to compare the effectiveness of bone-setting, 
light exercise therapy and physiotherapy in patients 
with LBP greater than 7 weeks. Patients were ran-
domly allocated into groups to receive up to 10 ses-
sions of bone-setting (n=45), light exercise therapy 
(n=35) or physiotherapy (n=34) over 6 weeks. Dis-
ability (Oswestry Disability Questionnaire) was re-
corded at baseline and one-year after treatment. Dis-
ability improved more in the bone-setting group. The 
authors concluded that traditional bone-setting was 
more effective than exercise or physiotherapy for pain 
and disability related to LBP. However, baseline dis-
ability was low and the bone setting group had slight-
ly worse baseline scores on average than the compar-
ison groups. Overall improvements were small across 
all groups and although the net improvement in the 
bonesetting group was statistically greater, it is un-
certain whether this had clinical significance. In addi-
tion, inclusion criteria included pain beyond 7 weeks, 
but the duration of pretreatment pain beyond that 
is unknown as is the balance of pain duration across patients in each group. If there is substantial het-
erogeneity in pain duration across groups, this could 
bias the outcomes as well. This study provides Level 
I therapeutic evidence that, in patients with subacute 
or chronic LBP and mild baseline disability, SMT, 
physiotherapy and exercise result in similar improve-
ments in function at one year. It offers Level IV evi-
dence that SMT results in improved pain and function.
Hurwitz et al63 compared outcomes related to LBP in 
patients who received medical or chiropractic care 
with or without physical modalities or physical ther-
apy in a multicenter randomized controlled trial. 
Participants had back pain ranging from 3 weeks to 
greater than one year. Distribution based on chronic-
ity was reasonably similar. In general, about 40% had 
pain for less than 3 months at onset of treatment and 
the other 60% had pain greater than 3 months, with 
45 to 49% of the total having pain for greater than a 
year. Patients were randomly assigned to receive chi-
ropractic care with physical modalities (n=172), chi-
ropractic care without physical modalities (n=169), 
medical care with physical therapy (n=170), or med-
ical care without physical therapy (n=170). Physical 
modalities included heat or cold therapy, ultrasound 
and/or electrical muscle stimulation. Physical thera-
py included heat or cold therapy, ultrasound, electri-
cal muscle stimulation, soft tissue and joint mobili-
zation, traction, supervised therapeutic exercise and/
or strengthening and flexibility exercises. Disability 
(Roland-Morris Low-Back Disability Questionnaire) 
and pain (numerical rating scale) were recorded at 
baseline and 2, 6, 26, 52 and 78 weeks after enroll-
ment. A total of 610 (90%) completed follow-up after 
18 months. Results revealed small, clinically insig-
nificant differences in pain and disability outcomes. 
The authors concluded that there were no clinically 
meaningful differences in outcomes between medi-
cal and chiropractic care without physical therapy or 
modalities, besides a difference in patient perception. 
This study provides Level I therapeutic evidence that, 
in patients with LBP of variable duration, SMT, SMT 
with modalities, routine medical care and medical 
care with physical therapy produced similar improve-
ments in pain and function at 18 months follow-up. Diagnosis &amp; Treatment of Low Back Pain | Recommendations | Physical Medicine &amp; Rehabilitation

Question 2 Evidence Summary: 
Haas et al49 conducted a randomized controlled trial 
in patients with chronic LBP to identify the dose-
response relationship between visits to a chiropractor 
for spinal manipulative therapy (SMT) and treatment 
outcomes and to compare treatment outcomes of 
manipulation versus light massage. Four hundred 
patients with  nonspecific LBP for at least 3 months 
were prescribed 18 sessions with a chiropractor 
(three times a week for six weeks). Participants were 
randomized to receive either 0, 6, 12 or 18 sessions of 
SMT (n=100 in each group). The chiropractor provided 
light massage for the remaining sessions that did not 
include SMT. Pain and disability (modified Von Korff  
pain and disability scales) were recorded at baseline 
and throughout a 52-week follow-up period. Pain and 
disability improved in all groups and was sustained for Question 2 Recommendation:
There is insufficient evidence to determine whether 12 to 18 visits of spinal manipulative thera-
py (SMT) results in better outcomes than 6 visits for the treatment of low back pain.
 Grade of Recommendation: Grade I   
52 weeks. The greatest treatment effects were found 
from 12 sessions of SMT. The authors concluded that 12 
SMT visits had modest effects on chronic LBP outcomes 
compared to the other dose levels, but the difference 
was not well distinguished. This study offers Level I 
therapeutic evidence that, in patients with LBP, spinal 
manipulative therapy is associated with statistically 
significant improvement in pain compared to light 
massage. However, it is uncertain whether this was 
clinically significant. Regarding frequency, this study 
offers Level I therapeutic evidence that 12-18 visits of 
SMT were statistically better than 6 visits at 12-week 
follow-up; no difference between doses at 1-year 
follow-up. Again, the differences were small and the 
clinical significance was uncertain.
Q1&amp;2 Future Directions for Research
Despite multiple studies, there is still uncertainty regarding the benefits of SMT 
for both acute and chronic LBP. There is significant heterogeneity across stud-
ies that contribute to uncertainty as well. There are opportunities for further 
well-designed studies to determine the efficacy of SMT in the treatment of LBP. FLASK Diagnosis &amp; Treatment of Low Back Pain | Recommendations | Physical Medicine &amp; Rehabilitation

 Grade of Recommendation: I  
In the long term, it is suggested that the addition of massage to an exercise program provides

Q1 Evidence Summary:
Hsieh et al64 compared efficacy of acupressure with 
that of usual care hospital based physical therapy for 
treating patients with chronic LBP. Patients received 
treatment for 4 weeks in both groups. Pain scores were 
evaluated in 56 and 65 patients studied at 6 months 
with 82% follow-up. This was a randomized study 
with one provider for the acupressure. At 6-month 
follow-up, there was significant reduction in pain in 
the acupressure group compared to physical therapy. 
This study provides Level I evidence that acupressure 
results in significantly greater relief of pain than usual 
care hospital based physical therapy at medium-term 
follow-up in patients with chronic LBP.
Hsieh et al65 compared efficacy of acupressure with 
that of standardized out patient physical therapy for 
treating patients with chronic LBP. This was a ran-
domized study with one provider for the acupressure. 
At 6 months, with 84% follow-up, there was signifi-
cant improvement in pain and disability scores in the 
acupressure group compared to physical therapy. This 
study provides Level I evidence that acupressure re-
sults in significantly greater improvement in pain and 
function than standardized outpatient physical thera-
py at medium-term follow-up in patients with chron-
ic LBP.These two studies by Hseih et al provided high quality 
evidence favoring acupressure over physical therapy. 
However, the acupressure was administered by one 
provider in both studies and concerns for external va-
lidity demand corroborating results by other provid-
ers to verify efficacy. 
Kankaanpa et al66 conducted a randomized trial to 
compare efficacy of active rehabilitation to a passive 
control group consisting of heat and massage. There 
were 54 patients total with 91% follow-up at one year. 
These patients had mild disability at baseline. At one 
year, the active group showed more improvement in 
pain and disability scores. This study was downgrad-
ed for small sample size, inability to mask groups and 
the relatively low baseline disability scores. It pro-
vides Level II evidence that active rehabilitation re-
sults in greater improvement in LBP relative to heat 
and massage at one year. 
Little et al67 compared the effectiveness of Alexander 
technique lessons, massage therapy and exercise ad-
vice with behavioral counseling for the treatment of

nique lessons (n=144) or 24 Alexander technique les-
sons (n=144). Half of each group randomly received 
an exercise prescription with behavioral counseling. 
Disability (Roland Morris disability score) and num-
ber of days in pain were recorded at baseline, three 
months and one year. Disability in the group that 
received exercise and lessons in the Alexander tech-
nique decreased while those who received massage 
had no effect on disability. This study provides Level 
II evidence that massage produced no long-term clin-
ically meaningful effects compared to usual care.
In a prospective study, Zhang et al68 aimed to deter-
mine the effectiveness of Chinese massage added to 
core stability exercises for the treatment of LBP. The 
inclusion criteria are not clearly stated in terms of 
acuity. It is implied that these were probably acute or subacute episodes, but this is uncertain. These pa-
tients were randomized to receive Chinese massage 
combined with core stability exercises (n=46) or Chi-
nese massage alone (n=46). Pain (VAS) and disability 
(Oswestry disability index) were assessed at baseline 
and after 2 and 8 weeks. Recurrence of LBP was eval-
uated after one year, but definition of recurrence was 
not clearly stated. Both groups experienced improve-
ments in pain and disability with no differences be-
tween groups after 2 weeks. After 8 weeks, pain and 
disability were significantly lower in the exercise and 
massage group compared to the massage-only group. 
The massage-only group had a significantly higher 
recurrence rate compared to the massage and exercise 
group based on phone interview one year later. This 
study provides Level II evidence that exercise is more 
effective than massage.

A systematic review of the literature yielded no studies to adequately address this question.

vii. Active stabilization exercise
Q1 Recommendation: 
There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against lumbar stabilization in 
patients with chronic low back pain. 
 Grade of Recommendation: I  
Q1 Evidence Summary:
Moussouli et al69 investigated the effects of an iso-
metric and isotonic stabilization exercise program on 
health-related quality of life in a study of women with 
chronic LBP. Women with LBP for at least 6 months 
were randomized to receive 4 60-minute sessions 
per week of isometric stabilization exercises (n=13), 
isotonic stabilization exercises (n=13), or no exercise 
(n=13). Health-related quality of life (SF=36) was as-
sessed upon enrollment, immediately after the four-
week treatment period and 9-months after treatment 
termination. The patients in the isometric stabiliza-
tion group had significant improvements in pain and 
vitality at treatment-termination that was maintained 
for 9 months. The authors concluded that isometric 
stabilization exercises reduce pain and enhance vital-
ity for at least 9 months in women with chronic LBP. 
The study’s small sample size was the primary factor 
in downgrading the level of evidence. This potential 
Level I study offers Level II therapeutic evidence that 
use of an isometric stabilization program improves 
functional outcomes in women with chronic LBP at 
9 months relative to a dynamic stabilization exercise 
program or no exercise at all. 
Lomond et al70 compared the effects of trunk stabili-
zation versus a movement system impairment exer-
cise strategy to treat patients with chronic LBP. Their 
premise is that LBP arises at least in part due to im-
paired postural coordination. Patients with LBP for at 
least 6 months were randomized to a 10-week physi-
cal therapy program consisting of either stabilization 
(n=29) or movement system impairment exercises 
(n=29). Pain (Numeric Pain Index) and function (Os-
westry Disability Index) were assessed 11 weeks and 
6 months after treatment initiation along with EMG 
function to assess postural reeducation. Both groups 
experienced improvements in pain and function at 
6-month follow-up. The detailed data reporting fo-
cused on EMG and muscle reeducation changes. There 
is one sentence that mentions comparable improve-ment in pain and disability scores although it suggests 
these improvements are modest and maybe not clin-
ically meaningful. The authors concluded that sta-
bilization treatment does not preferentially improve 
treatment outcomes in patients with LBP. The study 
had no power calculation and the sample size was 
small. They also did not report the details of the pain 
and disability scores. This study offers Level IV thera-
peutic evidence exercise improves pain and disability 
in patients with LBP and Level II evidence that trunk 
stabilization and movement system impairment exer-
cises result in similar outcomes for pain and disability 
with no improvement voluntary postural adjustment 
mechanisms in patients with LBP.
Ganesh et al71 investigated the effectiveness of the 
star excursion balance test (SEBT) grid training for 
the treatment of chronic LBP. Patients with mechan-
ical LBP for at least three months were randomized 
to receive 5 sessions per week for 4 weeks of diagno-
sis-specific interventions, core muscles strengthen-
ing and muscle training using the SEBT grid (n=30) 
or diagnosis-specific interventions, core muscle 
strengthening and stationary cycling (n=30). Disabil-
ity (Oswestry Disability Index), strength and endur-
ance (pressure-biofeedback unit) were assessed at 
baseline and at 4 and 16 weeks. Both groups had im-
provement in disability, strength and endurance with 
better improvement in the SEBT group compared to 
the conventional exercises. Although both programs 
resulted in improvement, the authors concluded that 
core muscle strengthening using a SEBT grid is more 
effective than conventional exercise programs. This 
study provides Level I therapeutic evidence that the 
addition of star excursion balance test and training 
to a diagnosis-specific intervention and core mus-
cle strengthening improves functional outcomes at 
short-term follow-up when compared with a cycling 
program using the same exercise program. Baseline 
disability for this study was modest (low 20 scores on 
Oswestry Disability prior to treatment). Diagnosis &amp; Treatment of Low Back Pain | Recommendations | Physical Medicine &amp; Rehabilitation

Work Group Narrative: The majority of McKenzie literature involves the centralization phenomenon 
which is commonly seen in patients with leg pain. This review examined only evidence in the subset 
of patients without radiating pain. Additional literature discussing clinical benefits from McKenzie for 
the treatment of LBP including radiating pain were not included in our systematic review. Therefore, a 
definitive statement of McKenzie in all patients with LBP cannot be made.

Q1 Evidence Summary:
Petersen et al72 conducted a randomized controlled 
trial to compare the effect of a McKenzie-based ex-
ercise program versus a strengthening exercise pro-
gram in patients with subacute or chronic LBP. Pa-
tients with LBP for at least 8 weeks were randomized 
to be treated with the McKenzie method (n=132) or 
with a dynamic strength training program (n=128) for 
8 weeks in a clinic followed by 2 weeks at home. A total 
of 260 patients were randomized. Follow-up was 71% (90/132) in the McKenzie group and 67% (86/128) in 
the dynamic exercise group. Pain (Manniche’s Low 
Back Pain Rating Scale) and disability (15-item dis-
ability scale) were recorded at baseline, after comple-
tion of the treatment program and 2 and 8 months af-
ter termination of the treatment. The participants in 
the McKenzie group had significantly greater reduc-
tion of disability compared to the strengthening pro-
gram at 2-month follow-up. At 8-month follow-up,  Diagnosis &amp; Treatment of Low Back Pain | Recommendations | Physical Medicine &amp; Rehabilitation
Recommendations were developed based on a specific definition, inclusion/exclusion criteria, and the resulting literature which excluded conditions 
such as presence of a neurological deficit or leg pain experienced below the knee, among others. Given the exclusion criteria, these guideline rec-

This clinical guideline is not intended to be a fixed treatment protocol; it is anticipated that there will be patients who require more or less treatment than what is outlined. This clinical guideline should not be construed as including all proper methods of care or excluding other acceptable methods of care reasonably directed to obtaining the same results. The ultimate judgment regarding any specific procedure or treatment is to be made by the physician and patient in light of all circumstances presented by the patient and the needs and resources particular to the locality or institution.130
there were no differences in pain or disability between 
groups. The authors concluded that the McKenzie 
method and intensive dynamic strengthening train-
ing are equally effective for the treatment of subacute 
or chronic LBP. This Level I study was downgraded 
because a substantial percent of patients were lost to 
follow-up. This provides Level II evidence that, at 8 
months, there is no difference between pain and dis-
ability scores between strength training and a McK-
enzie based exercise program in patients with CLBP. 
This also provides Level IV evidence that an exercise 
program results in significant improvement in pain 
and disability for patients with chronic LBP.
In a one-year follow-up to the Petersen et al72 ran-
domized controlled trial, Petersen et al73 reported the 
long-term outcomes of the McKenzie-based exercise 
program and strengthening exercise program. This is 
the same study as above, but slightly longer follow-up 
and with evaluation of prognostic factors. They were 
able to retrieve additional patients with data on 
93% at 14 months, versus the 70% follow-up at the 
8-month mark. There were no differences in func-
tional status, pain level, work status or use of health 
care services at 14-month follow-up between the 2 
groups. Again there was significant improvement in 
pain and disability scores that was of questionable 
clinical importance. In the McKenzie group, there was 
a 7-point improvement in the ODI from 36 to 29 and a 
9 point improvement in the other group from 39 to 30. 
A total of 665 reported poor outcomes on reduction of 
disability and 75% poor reduction of pain. There were 
similar modest improvements in pain scores. Out-
comes were most correlated with low expectations 
for future work ability, lack of compliance with ex-ercise program and lower initial baseline scores. The 
authors concluded that poor long-term outcomes can 
be explained by various patient-related factors which 
seemed to be stronger determinants of outcomes than 
the exercise programs studied. This study offers Level 
I therapeutic evidence that, at 14 months, there is no 
difference between pain and disability scores between 
strength training and a McKenzie based exercise pro-
gram in patients with chronic LBP. 
Garcia et al74 aimed to compare the effectiveness of 
Back School and the McKenzie method for patients 
with chronic  nonspecific LBP. Patients with LBP for 
at least 3 months were randomized to receive one 
session per week for 4 weeks of either a group-based 
Back School (n=74) or individual McKenzie treatment 
(n=74). All participants were also instructed to com-
plete exercises at home daily. The care provider of 
both groups was certified by the McKenzie Institute of 
Brazil and the outcome assessor received two months 
of McKenzie training from the McKenzie-certified 
therapist. Pain intensity (numerical rating scale) and 
disability (Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire) 
were assessed at baseline and 1, 3 and 6 months after 
randomization. Participants in the McKenzie group 
had statistically greater improvements in disability 
at one month but not 6 months compared to the Back 
School group. The authors concluded that the McK-
enzie method was slightly more effective than Back 
School for disability, but not for pain intensity in par-
ticipants with chronic LBP. This study provides Level I 
therapeutic evidence that, at 6-month follow-up, the 
McKenzie method provides slight disability benefit as 
compared to the back school method though pain im-
provements are similar and modest at this time point.

 ix. Yoga
Q1 Recommendation:
It is suggested that, in patients with mild chronic low back pain, yoga may offer medium-term 
improvements in pain and function compared to usual care, although these improvements are 
not clinically meaningful due to low baseline pain/disability.
 Grade of Recommendation: B  
Q1 Evidence Summary:
In a randomized controlled trial. Aboagye et al75 
compared the cost-effectiveness of medical yoga 
versus evidence-based exercise therapy and self-care 
advice for nonspecific LBP. In a 6-week treatment 
period, participants were randomly assigned to 
participate in group medical yoga twice a week (n=52), 
individual standardized strength exercise therapy 
twice weekly (n=52), or a booklet of self-care advice 
and advice to stay active (n=55). Health-related 
quality of life (EQ-5D) was assessed at baseline, 6 
weeks, 6 and 12 months. Follow-up response rates 
were 89% for yoga, 69% for exercise and 63% for 
self-care advice. At 12-month follow-up, participants 
in the yoga group who adhered to the recommended 
protocol had statistically significantly better HRQOL 
(0.79 ± 0.14) compared to self-care advice (0.75 ± 
0.23), but there was no difference when comparing to 
exercise therapy. The authors concluded that 6 weeks 
of adherence to uninterrupted medical yoga therapy is 
cost-effective for early treatment of nonspecific LBP. 
During critical appraisal, the work group downgraded 
the level of evidence of this study due to less than 80% 
follow-up. In addition, the authors did not clearly 
define the nature of the inclusion criteria. These 
appear to be patients with nonspecific back pain, but 
acuity is not stated and baseline severity appears to 
be mild. Implication would be that these were patients 
with relatively acute back pain. This potential Level 
I study offers Level II therapeutic evidence that 
there was no difference in health outcomes between 
treatment groups for patients receiving yoga relative 
to an alternative exercise program, although both 
were better than self-care in patients with uncertain 
acuity of LBP. 
Tilbrook et al76 conducted a multicenter randomized 
controlled trial to examine the effectiveness of yoga 
for treatment of chronic or recurrent LBP. Patients with LBP received a back pain education booklet and 
were randomized to participate in 12 yoga classes over 
3 months (n=156) or usual care (n=157). Back func-
tion (Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire), pain 
(Aberdeen Back Pain Scale), pain self-efficacy (Pain 
Self-Efficacy Questionnaire) and general health mea-
sures were recorded at baseline and after 3, 6 and 12 
months. These patients had mild disability at base-
line. The yoga group had better back function at all 3 
follow-up points. Pain and general health scores were 
similar between groups. The authors concluded that a 
12-week yoga program had greater improvements in 
back function compared to usual care in adults with 
chronic or recurrent LBP. This study provides Level I 
therapeutic evidence that, in patients with LBP of mild 
severity, yoga is associated with greater improve-
ments in disability at one year compared to usual care.
Williams et al77 compared the effects of Iyengar yoga 
therapy versus education in a randomized controlled 
trial of patients with nonspecific chronic LBP. Patients 
with LBP for more than 3 months were randomized to 
receive a 16-week period of Iyengar yoga (n=30) or 
education (n=30). Functional disability (Pain Disabil-
ity Index), pain intensity (Short Form-McGill Pain 
Questionnaire), pain medication usage, pain-related 
attitudes and behaviors, and spinal range of motion 
were assessed before and after the interventions and 
at 3-month follow-up. Of the 60 participants en-
rolled, 42 (70%) completed the study. The yoga group 
had significant reduced pain intensity, function-
al disability and pain medication usage at 3-month 
follow-up. The authors concluded that Iyengar yoga 
therapy results in improvement in medical and func-
tional LBP-related outcomes in patients with mild 
chronic LBP. In critique, small sample size and less 
than 80% follow-up were factors in downgrading the 
level of evidence for this study. In addition, it is not- Diagnosis &amp; Treatment of Low Back Pain | Recommendations | Physical Medicine &amp; Rehabilitation

ed that this group of patients had chronic LBP that 
was mild in severity at baseline. This potential Level I 
study offers Level II therapeutic evidence that, in pa-
tients with LBP of mild severity, yoga may decrease 
disability at 3 months compared to self-directed 
standard medical care. It also resulted in significant 
improvement in pain, although these improvements 
were clinically very small, at least in part due to the 
relatively low starting scores at baseline.
Williams et al78 conducted a randomized controlled 
trial to compare the effects of yoga and standard 
medical care in patients with chronic LBP. Patients 
with LBP for greater than 3 months were randomized 
to a yoga group (n=43) or control group of standard 
medical care (n=47). Yoga participants completed a 
24-week program of biweekly yoga classes. Disability 
(Oswestry Disability Questionnaire), pain (VAS), de-
pression (Beck Depression Inventory) and pain med-ication usage were recorded upon enrollment, after 12 
weeks, upon completion of the program (24 weeks) 
and 6-month follow-up. The yoga group experienced 
significantly greater functional disability, pain inten-
sity and depression improvements compared to the 
usual care group at 24 weeks. The authors concluded 
that yoga results in improved functional disability, 
pain intensity and depression in adults with chronic 
LBP. Patient follow-up was less than 80%; therefore, 
the work group downgraded this study from Level I to 
Level II. Again, it is noted that this group of patients 
had chronic LBP that was mild in severity at baseline. 
This study provides Level II therapeutic evidence that 
yoga provides significant improvements in pain and 
disability at 6 months compared to standard care. 
Again, at least in part due to low starting scores at 
baseline, the magnitude of these improvements were 
small.
Q2 Evidence Summary:
A systematic review of the literature yielded no studies to adequately address this question.

 x. Aerobic exercise
Q1 Recommendations: 
Aerobic exercise is recommended to improve pain, disability and mental health in patients with 
nonspecific low back pain at short-term follow-up.
 Grade of Recommendation: A  
There is insufficient evidence that aerobic exercise improves pain, disability and mental health 
in patients with non-specific low back pain at long-term follow-up.
 Grade of Recommendation: I 
Q1 Evidence Summary:
Murtezani et al79 conducted a randomized controlled 
trial to study the effectiveness of high-intensity aer-
obic exercise for the treatment of chronic LBP. Pa-
tients with LBP for at least 3 months were randomized 
to receive 3 30- to 45-minute sessions per week of 
supervised aerobic exercise based on individual heart 
rate zones (n=50) or passive modalities such as in-
terferential current, transcutaneous electrical nerve 
stimulation, ultrasound and heat without any form 
of physical activity (n=51) for 12 weeks. LBP intensity 
(VAS), disability (Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability 
Questionnaire), fingertip-to-floor distance and psy-
chosocial factors were assessed upon enrollment and 
after 12 weeks. The exercise group had significant im-
provements in pain intensity, disability and anxiety/
depression at 12 weeks. The authors concluded that 
high-intensity aerobic exercise reduces pain, disabil-
ity and psychological strain in patients with chronic 
LBP. This study offers Level I therapeutic evidence 
that, in patients with LBP, aerobic exercise resulted 
in better pain and functional outcomes compared to 
passive modalities at short-term follow-up. 
In a randomized controlled trial, Cuesta-Vargas et al80 
evaluated the effect of the addition of deep water run-
ning to standard general practice compared to general 
practice alone for the treatment of LBP. Patients with 
LBP for at least three months were randomized to re-
ceive general practice plus three 30-minute sessions 
of deep water running per week (n=29) or general 
practice alone (n=29) for 15 weeks. General practice 
involved a physician’s consultation and educational 
booklet. Disability (Spanish version of Roland Mor-
ris Disability Questionnaire), pain (VAS) and general health (SF-12) were recorded at baseline and at 4, 6 
and 12 months. Both groups had improvements. The 
deep-water running group had significantly great-
er improvements in pain and disability compare to 
general practice alone. The authors concluded that 
the addition of deep water running to general prac-
tice was more effective than general practice alone 
in patients with nonspecific chronic LBP. This study 
provides Level I therapeutic evidence that, in patients 
with LBP, the addition of aerobic exercise to an ed-
ucation program compared to an education program 
alone resulted in significant improvement in pain, 
disability and mental health at 12-month follow-up. 
Chatzitheodorou et al81 aimed to evaluate the ef-
fects of high-intensity aerobic exercise in patients 
with chronic musculoskeletal LBP. Patients with LBP 
for at least 6 months were randomized to receive a 
high-intensity aerobic exercise program 3 times per 
week (n=10) or passive modalities without physi-
cal activity (n=10) for 12 weeks. Pain (McGill Pain 
Questionnaire), disability (Roland-Morris Disability 
Questionnaire), psychological strain (Hospital anxi-
ety and Depression Scale) and cortisol concentrations 
(ng/mL) were recorded before and after the 12-week 
treatment period. Participants in the exercise group 
had significant reductions in pain, disability and 
psychological strain while the subjects who received 
passive modalities did not experience any changes. 
The authors concluded that high-intensity exercise 
improved pain, disability and psychological strain in 
subjects with chronic LBP, but did not improve serum 
cortisol concentrations. Although the sample size 
was small, statistically significant differences were 
found between patient groups. This study offers Lev- Diagnosis &amp; Treatment of Low Back Pain | Recommendations | Physical Medicine &amp; Rehabilitation

el I therapeutic evidence that, at 12-week follow-up, 
high intensity aerobic exercise decreases pain, dis-
ability and anxiety/depression compared to passive 
modalities in patients with chronic LBP. 
Tritilanunt et al82 evaluated the efficacy of an aerobic 
exercise and health education program for the treat-
ment of chronic LBP. Patients with LBP for at least 
three months were randomly assigned to participate 
in an aerobic exercise program (n=36) or a lumbar 
flexion exercise program (n=36). Health education 
was included in both programs. Pain (VAS), anthro-
pometric and biochemical characteristics were re-corded before and after the 12-week treatment period. 
The aerobic exercise group had significantly greater 
improvements in pain compared to the lumbar flex-
ion group. The authors concluded that the aerobic ex-
ercise and education program is useful and can be a 
treatment option for patients with chronic LBP. This 
study provides Level I therapeutic evidence that, in 
patients with chronic LBP, aerobic exercise decreases 
pain more than lumbar flexion exercise and both ex-
ercise treatments resulted in significant reduction in 
pain.

xi. Work hardening or conditioning
Q1 Recommendations: 
In patients with low back pain, work hardening may be considered to improve return to work. 
 Grade of Recommendation: C   
There is insufficient evidence that work hardening is different than an active therapeutic ex -
ercise program or guideline-based physical therapy.
 Grade of Recommendation: I
Q1 Evidence Summary:
Bendix et al83 conducted a randomized controlled tri-
al to investigate the effectiveness of a comprehensive 
functional restoration program versus an intensive 
outpatient physical training program for the treat-
ment of chronic LBP. Patients with chronic LBP were 
randomized to receive functional restoration (n=64) 
or outpatient intensive physical training (n=74). The 
functional restoration program involved physical 
training, ergonomic training and behavioral support 
for 39 hours per week for 3 weeks. The outpatient in-
tensive physical training program consisted of 1.5 
hours of training 3 times per week for 8 weeks. Pa-
tients were assessed at baseline and at one-year fol-
low-up. There were no statistically significant dif-
ferences in work capability, sick leave, health care 
contacts, back pain, leg pain or self-reported activi-
ties of daily living outcomes between groups. The au-
thors concluded that functional restoration program 
was superior to the physical training program only in 
terms of overall assessment, but no other outcomes. 
This study provides Level I therapeutic evidence that, 
in patients with LBP, functional restoration and out-
patient intensive training provide equivalent results 
for sick leave, back pain and function at one year. 
Sang et al84 evaluated the effectiveness of a work hard-
ening program for the treatment of LBP. Patients with 
a work-related back injury who were unable to work 
and referred to the occupational therapy department 
were enrolled in a 12-week work hardening program 
(n=32). The program consisted of muscle stretching, 
lifting capacity training, carrying capacity training 
and work tolerance training based on the overload 
training principle. Participants completed two to three 
90-minute sessions per week for 12 weeks. Return to 
work was recorded during a 3-month follow-up via telephone. Seventy-five percent of the participants 
who completed the program had returned to work by 
3-month follow-up. The authors concluded that since 
this rate was similar to other studies, the overload-
ing principle should be used to design work hardening 
programs. This study offers Level IV therapeutic evi-
dence that work hardening is associated with return 
to sedentary-to-medium work in 75% patients with 
LBP. 
Casso et al85 conducted a prospective study to investi-
gate the return-to-work status one year after a phys-
ical reconditioning program in manual laborers with 
chronic LBP. Patients with LBP and absent from work 
for at least 3 months (n=125) completed a 3-week in-
patient program consisting of 6 hours of group treat-
ment per day, 5 days a week. Participants and their 
physicians were sent a follow-up questionnaire one 
year after completion of the program. Of the 109 pa-
tients who had a job available to them at the time of 
completion of the program, 90 (81.6%) were consid-
ered capable of returning to work full- or part-time. 
After one year, 57 (52.3%) patients were working and 
52 patients were on disability leave (47.7%). The au-
thors concluded that the reconditioning program had 
positive effects on return-to-work status after one 
year. This study offers Level IV therapeutic evidence 
that an intensive recondition program results in re-
turn to part-time or full-time work in about 80% at 
the end of training program and about 50% at one-
year follow-up.

least three months (n=39) were enrolled in a functional 
restoration program. The program consisted of 
physician counseling, physical exercises, aerobic 
activity, manual handling and lifting techniques, 
muscle strengthening on machines, stretching and 
relaxation for a total of 5.5 hours per day, 5 days a 
week, for 5 weeks. One year after completion of the 
program, 25 (64%) patients had returned to work and 
the number of sick leave days significantly decreased 
compared to the year before the program. The authors 
concluded that the functional restoration program 
was effective. This study offers Level IV therapeutic 
evidence that, in patients with LBP, work hardening 
improves return-to-work rate.
Luk et al87 aimed to study the effectiveness of a mul-
tidisciplinary rehabilitation program for patients 
with chronic LBP. Patients with LBP for at least three 
months (n=65) were enrolled in a 14-week multidis-
ciplinary rehabilitation program consisting of phys-
ical conditioning, work conditioning and work read-
iness. LBP intensity (VAS), self-perceived disability 
(Oswestry Disability Questionnaire Index), range of 
motion, isoinertial performance of the trunk mus-
cles and depression were recorded at baseline, week 
7 and 14 and month 6. Twenty-eight (51.8%) of the 
54 patients who completed the 6-month follow-up 
assessments returned to work. Pain significantly im-
proved in both groups at 6-month follow-up. Disabil-
ity improved significantly more in those who returned 
to work compared to those who did not. The authors 
concluded that this rehabilitation program improved 
physical functioning and ability to return to work. 
This study provides Level IV therapeutic evidence that 
14-week work hardening program resulted in about 
50% return-to-work (RTW) rate, improved function-
al scores only in those that RTW and improved pain 
scores regardless of RTW. RTW was predicted 74% of 
the time. All patients that returned to work were on 
sick leave at entry.
Roche et al88 performed a multicenter prospective ran-
domized controlled study to compare the short-term 
effectiveness of active individual therapy and a func-
tional restoration program for the treatment of LBP. 
All patients were unable to work at the time of enroll-
ment. Patients with chronic LBP were randomized to 
receive 5 weeks of either a functional restoration pro-
gram (n=68) or active individual therapy (n=64). The 
functional restoration program consisted of 25 hours 
per week of isotonic muscular-strengthening exer-
cises and endurance exercises increasing progressive-
ly throughout the program, referral to a psychologist 
and dietary advice. The active individual therapy con-sisted of 3 hours per week of flexibility training, pain 
management, stretching and proprioception exercis-
es plus instructions to complete exercises at home for 
50 minutes twice a week. Trunk flexibility, endurance, 
pain severity (VAS) and impact of pain on quality of 
life (Dallas Pain Questionnaire, DPQ) such as dai-
ly activities, work and leisure activities, anxiety and 
depression and social interest were recorded at base-
line and upon completion of the 5-week program. All 
outcomes improved in both groups with the exception 
of endurance in the active individual therapy group. 
Pain intensity and DPQ scores for daily activities and 
work and leisure were similar between groups. Other 
outcomes improved significantly greater in the func-
tional restoration program compared to the active 
individual therapy group. The authors concluded that 
low-cost ambulatory active individual therapy is ef-
fective and the main advantage of a functional resto-
ration program is improved endurance. This study of-
fers Level I therapeutic evidence that work hardening 
may be slightly better than active exercise program 
in improving quality of life and RTW in patients with 
CLBP currently unable to work. This study also pro-
vides Level IV therapeutic evidence that an active to 
intensive exercise program results in improvement in 
quality of life and RTW. 
Sivan et al89 investigated the effect of a 3-week func-
tional restoration program on functional and voca-
tional outcomes in patients with chronic LBP. Pa-
tients with LBP for at least 6 months were enrolled in 
an intense rehabilitation program 5 days a week for 
3 weeks totaling 100 hours. The program consisted of 
physical training (aerobics, hydrotherapy, back ex-
ercises) and psychological and occupational training 
(education, CBT, relaxation techniques, recreational 
activities, group counseling). Functional status (Os-
westry Disability Index, ODI and Roland Morris Dis-
ability Questionnaire, RM) and impact on work status 
were assessed at baseline and at least one year after 
completion of the program (n=118). Functional status 
(ODI and RM) and work status significantly improved. 
The authors concluded that this functional restoration 
program improves the functional and vocational sta-
tus of patients with chronic LBP Approximately 1/3 
of patients were lost to follow-up. This study offers 
Level IV therapeutic evidence that, for patients with 
CLBP and impaired ability to work, an intensive exer-
cise program results in improved RTW and functional 
outcome scores after 2 years.

treatment of nonspecific chronic LBP. Patients with 
LBP for less than 12 weeks from 49 different primary 
care practices were randomly assigned to an intensive 
group training protocol (n=60) or physiotherapy ac-
cording to the Dutch guidelines for LBP (n=54). The 
intensive group training protocol included 10 individ-
ual sessions and 20 group sessions of exercise thera-
py, back school and operant-conditioning behavioral 
principles with a goal to return to normal daily activ-
ities. Functional disability (Roland Morris disabili-
ty questionnaire), pain intensity (numerical rating 
scale), perceived recovery and sick leave due to LBP 
were recorded at baseline and after 6, 13, 26 and 52 
weeks. Intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses 
revealed no significant differences between groups at one-year follow-up. The authors concluded that the 
intensive group training protocol was not more effec-
tive than usual physiotherapy for chronic LBP. In cri-
tique, the study’s sample size was small and less than 
80% of patients completed follow-up. Due to these 
reasons, the work group downgraded the study from 
Level I to Level II. This is also a less chronic popula-
tion than other studies with symptoms present less 
than 12 weeks. This study provides Level II therapeu-
tic evidence that an intensive group training protocol 
involving exercise, education and behavioral princi-
ples was no more effective than PT done per the Dutch 
guidelines at one-year follow-up of patients with 
chronic LBP. This was true for functional outcomes 
(RM), pain and fear avoidance.

QQPM&amp;R Question 3. Are there specific patient or treatment characteristics that 
predict improved duration of pain, intensity of pain, functional outcomes and 
return-to-work status with SMT following an episode of low back pain? 
Definition: SMT defined as spinal manipulative therapy, manual therapy, mobilization, and high 
velocity thrusts
Recommendations: 
There is conflicting evidence that symptoms above the knee, low fear avoidance question-
naire score, at least one hypomobile segment, and greater than 35° of internal rotation of 
the hip are predictive of responding to spinal manipulative therapy (SMT) for patients with 
acute low back pain. 
 Grade of Recommendation: I  
Flynn et al1 prospectively studied a cohort of patients 
with LBP in order to develop a clinical prediction rule 
(CPR) to identify patients with LBP who are like-
ly to improve with spinal manipulation. Patients re-
ferred to physical therapy for LBP (n=71) underwent 
an initial standardized examination and reported 
pain (11-point scale), disability (Modified Oswestry 
Disability Questionnaire) and beliefs about activity 
(Fear-Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire). A therapist 
performed spinal manipulation on all patients during 
an initial session. Participants reported disability and 
attended a second treatment session 2-4 days af-
ter the initial session. If disability improvement was 
&gt;50%, the study participant was ended due to success 
in treatment. If disability improvement was&lt;50%, the 
participant attended one final treatment session after 
2-4 days. Patients were also instructed to complete 
pelvic tilt range of motion exercise and maintain usual 
activity levels within pain limits. Statistical analyses 
aimed to determine the association between individ-
ual variables from the initial examination and catego-
rization of successful treatment. Thirty-two patients 
were classified as having successful treatment. A CPR 
was developed using 5 variables: &lt;16-day duration of 
symptoms, at least one hip with &gt;35° of internal rota-
tion, hypomobility with lumbar spring testing, FABQ 
work subscale score &lt;19 and no symptoms distal to 
the knee. The authors concluded that patients with 
LBP who are likely to respond to spinal manipulation 
can be identified before treatment. This study offers 
Level II prognostic evidence that, in patients with 
LBP receiving SMT and exercise, the following clini-
cal predictors are associated with 50% improvement 
for function within one week: symptoms less than 16 
days, symptoms above the knee, low fear avoidance 
questionnaire score, at least one hypomobile seg-ment, greater than 35° of internal rotation of the hip; 
presence of more predictors associated with increased 
likelihood of responding to treatment.
Childs et al2 aimed to validate the spinal manipulation 
CPR developed by Flynn et al1 in a multicenter ran-
domized controlled trial. Patients who were referred 
to physical therapy for LBP were randomly assigned 
to receive exercise alone (n=61) or exercise plus ma-
nipulation (n=70). All participants completed ques-
tionnaires to measure pain (11-point pain-rating 
scale), Fear-Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire (FABQ) 
and Oswestry Disability Questionnaire (ODQ) and 
were assessed by a physical therapist using the CPR. 
To be considered positive on the CPR, patients had to 
have at least 4 out of 5 of the following: duration of 
current episode of LBP &lt;16 days, no symptoms distal 
to the knee, FABQ work subscale score &lt;19 points, ≥1 
hypomobile segment in the lumbar spine, ≥ one hip 
with &gt;35° of internal rotation range of motion. Par-
ticipants were invited for follow-up after one week, 4 
weeks and 6 months. Patients who received manip-
ulation had greater improvements in disability and 
pain than those who received exercise alone. The pa-
tients who were positive on the rule and received ma-
nipulation had greater improvement in disability and 
pain at all follow-up points compared to patients who 
were negative on the rule and received manipulation. 
The authors concluded that the CPR could be used to 
assist with decision-making in patients with LBP. 
This study offers Level II prognostic evidence that, 
in patients with LBP receiving SMT and exercise, the 
following clinical predictors are associated with 50% 
improvement for function within one week: symp-
toms less than 16 days, symptoms above the knee, low 
fear avoidance questionnaire score, at least one hy- Diagnosis &amp; Treatment of Low Back Pain | Recommendations | Physical Medicine &amp; Rehabilitation

with increased likelihood of responding to treatment. 
Dougherty et al3 conducted a randomized controlled 
trial to evaluate a modified CPR for spinal manipula-
tive therapy (SMT) in patients with chronic LBP. Pa-
tients with chronic LBP were screened using a modi-
fied version of Flynn et al’s1 CPR and were categorized 
as positive or negative. They were then randomized to 
receive SMT (n=92) or active exercise therapy (n=89) 
twice weekly for 4 weeks. Active exercise therapy in-
cluded directional preference exercises, lumbar stabi-
lization, general flexibility and specific training exer-
cises. To be considered positive on the modified CPR, 
patients had to have at least 3 out of the following: pain 
proximal to the knee, internal hip rotation of greater 
than 35°, hypomobility of one or greater lumbar seg-
ments and FABQ work subscale score of less than 19. 
Participants completed questionnaires at baseline 
and after 5, 12 and 24 weeks which included pain in-
tensity (VAS), SF-36, disability (Oswestry Disability 
Index), patient satisfaction and patient expectation. 
Both groups experienced improvements in pain and 
disability after treatment. There were no significant 
differences in outcomes between therapy groups or 
based on classification on the modified CPR. The au-
thors concluded that the modified CPR cannot be used 
to determine which patients would benefit more from 
SMT. This study offers Level I prognostic evidence 
that, in patients with chronic LBP receiving SMT, the 
following clinical predictors are not associated with a 
substantially different pain and functional outcome: 
symptoms above the knee, low fear avoidance ques-
tionnaire score, at least one hypomobile segment and 
greater than 35° of internal rotation of the hip.
Hancock et al4 conducted a multicenter randomized 
controlled trial in Sydney, Australia to investigate the 
use of the CPR developed by Flynn et al1 in patients with 
LBP presenting to outpatient general practice clinics. 
Patients who presented to a general practitioner with 
LBP &lt;6 weeks received usual care (reassurance, advice 
to remain active and avoid bed rest and prescription 
of paracetamol) and were randomized into one of four 
treatment arms. Patients were randomized to receive 
either diclofenac or placebo and further randomized 
to receive SMT or placebo. Since neither SMT nor di-
clofenac were found to significantly reduce time to 
recovery from pain, both placebo SMT groups were 
considered the control group and both active SMT 
groups were considered the intervention group for the 
purpose of this study. During initial evaluation, each 
patient was classified using the CPR; at least 4 out of 5 criteria were necessary to be classified as positive. 
The participants in the intervention group (n=120) 
received up to 12 treatments of SMT over 4 weeks. The 
participants in the intervention group (n=120) re-
ceived sham ultrasound for the same duration of time. 
Pain (11-point scale) and disability (24-point Roland 
Morris disability questionnaire) were recorded at 1, 2, 
4 and 12 weeks. Patients who were classified as po-
sition on the CPR had greater improvements in pain 
and disability regardless of treatment. There were no 
significant interaction effects in pain or disability be-
tween treatment groups and prediction rule classifi-
cation. The authors concluded that the CPR validated 
by Childs et al2 was not generalizable to patients in 
the primary care setting. This study provides Level II 
prognostic evidence that, in patients with acute LBP 
receiving SMT, the following clinical predictors were 
not found to be associated with improvements for pain 
and function: symptoms less than 16 days, symptoms 
above the knee, low fear avoidance questionnaire 
score, at least one hypomobile segment, greater than 
35° of internal rotation of the hip; presence of more 
predictors associated with increased likelihood of re-
sponding to treatment
Hallegraeff et al5 assessed the efficacy of manipula-
tive therapy in a multicenter randomized controlled 
trial. Patients with acute nonspecific LBP who met 
three factors of the CPR (duration of symptoms &lt;16 
days, no pain distal of the knee, age &gt;35 years)1 were 
randomized into one of 2 treatment arms. The in-
tervention group (n=31) received 4 sessions of ma-
nipulative therapy along with physical therapy (low 
intensity endurance exercises). The control group 
(n=33) received physical therapy alone. Pain (VAS), 
disability (Oswestry Disability Low Back Pain Ques-
tionnaire) and mobility (Sit-and-Reach Test) were 
recorded at baseline and after 2.5 weeks of treatment. 
The patients who received manipulation therapy had 
a greater improvement in disability compared to the 
control group, but there were no significant differ-
ences in pain or mobility. The authors concluded that 
although there were statistically significant interac-
tion effects for disability and sex, these had low effect 
size and there were no significant effects for pain or 
mobility. This study provides Level I prognostic evi-
dence that the addition of manipulative therapy added 
benefit over physical therapy alone for improving dis-
ability. However, it did not support that the two-factor 
CPR was predictive of responders (predictive variables 
include: duration of symptoms less than 16 days, no 
pain distal to the knee and age greater than 35 years).  Diagnosis &amp; Treatment of Low Back Pain | Recommendations | Physical Medicine &amp; Rehabilitation

There is insufficient evidence that hyper- or hypo-mobility, patient age, strains and sprains, in-
stability, severe affective distress, relationship with healthcare provider, use of thrust vs. non-
thrust techniques, pretreatment psychological or socioeconomic status, or number of visits are 
predictive factors of response to spinal manipulative therapy (SMT). 
 Grade of Recommendation: I  
Cook et al6 aimed to evaluate the predictive value of 
prognostic variables in outcomes in patients with 
LBP in a secondary analysis of a multicenter random-
ized controlled trial (RCT). All participants received 
manual therapy for 2 visits, either thrust (n=76) or 
non-thrust (n=73). The results of the RCT found no 
differences between thrust or nonthrust techniques. 
Outcome measures included disability per the Os-
westry Disability Index (ODI), Numeric Pain Rating 
Scale (NPRS), total visits and report of rate of re-
covery. Predictive values included body mass index 
(BMI), NPRS at baseline, ODI at baseline, Fear-Avoid-
ance Beliefs Questionnaire (FABQ) work subscale at 
baseline, CPR for spinal manipulation (presence of at 
least 4 of the following: no pain below knee, symp-
tom duration &lt;16 days, FABQ-W score &lt;19, 1+ hips 
with internal rotation range of motion &gt;35° and 1+ 
hypomobile lumbar segment), duration of symptoms 
(weeks), age, irritability, diagnosis and allocation to 
thrust versus nonthrust technique. Logistic and linear 
regression modeling were used to create predictive 
models and find significant explanatory power for 
the outcome variables. A positive CPR at baseline was 
present in all 4 models. The authors concluded that 
the CPR was prognostic for all outcome measures. 
This study offers Level II prognostic evidence that, 
in preselected patients with LBP, CPR is a predictor 
of success for treatment with SMT; factors included 
meeting the CPR, age, strains and sprains, instability, 
irritability, ODI score on first visit, duration of symp-
toms and met numerical pain rating scale score on 
first visit.
In a retrospective analysis of data from a random-
ized controlled trial, Cecchi et al7 aimed to identify 
predictors of response to various interventions for 
chronic LBP. Patients with chronic LBP were random-
ly assigned to receive back school (n=68), individual 
physiotherapy (n=68) or spinal manipulation (n=69). 
Participants were classified as nonresponders to ther-
apy if their changes in Roland Morris Disability score 
improved by less than &lt;2.5 after treatment. Poten-
tial predictors of response, including demographics, 
baseline disability and pain intensity and life satis-
faction, were analyzed using multivariable backward 
logistic regression to predict the probability of non-response to treatment. The authors concluded that a 
lower baseline Roland Morris Disability score predict-
ed nonresponse for physiotherapy, but not for spinal 
manipulation. This study provides Level II prognostic 
evidence that there are no predictive factors for suc-
cess with SMT. 
Cook et al8 analyzed data from a multicenter ran-
domized clinical trial to determine if changes in pain 
during or between sessions of manual therapy were 
associated with outcomes in patients treated for LBP. 
Participants (n=100) had been randomized to receive 
thrust or nonthrust manipulation, along with a home 
exercise program. Patients reported pain (Numeri-
cal Pain Rating Scale), disability (Oswestry Disability 
Questionnaire) and rate of recovery (0-100%) at base-
line, after two sessions and at discharge. Functional 
recovery was defined as ≥50% reduction in Oswestry 
Disability Index (ODI). The authors concluded that a 
change of ≥2 points on the 11-point scale is associat-
ed with functional recovery at discharge. This study 
offers Level II prognostic evidence that, in preselect-
ed patients with LBP treated with SMT, a 2-point re-
duction in pain score after the second visit predicts a 
higher likelihood of functional improvement. 
In a secondary analysis of data from a prospective, 
multicenter, randomized controlled trial (RCT), Don-
aldson et al9 studied outcomes in patients with LBP 
who were matched, unmatched, or indifferent to their 
preference of thrust versus nonthrust manual thera-
py intervention. Prior to randomization, patients in-
dicated their preference of an exercise program plus 
two sessions of either thrust or nonthrust manual 
therapy. As part of the RCT, 77 participants were al-
located to thrust manipulation and 77 participants 
were allocated to nonthrust manipulation. Outcomes 
of disability (Oswestry Disability Index), pain per-
ception (11-point Numerical Pain Rating Scale), care 
intensity, fear-avoidance behaviors (FABQ) and per-
ception of extent of recovery were measured. There 
were no statistically significant differences in any 
of the outcomes between patient preference groups. 
The authors concluded that there were no statistical 
differences in disability or pain in patients who were 
matched, unmatched, or indifferent to their assigned  Diagnosis &amp; Treatment of Low Back Pain | Recommendations | Physical Medicine &amp; Rehabilitation

intervention. This study provides Level II prognostic 
evidence that, in patients with LBP, patient prefer-
ence for specific manipulation technique did not af-
fect outcomes.
Fritz et al10 investigated the value of posterior-anterior 
mobility testing for predicting disability outcomes 
in patients with LBP in a randomized controlled 
trial. Participants underwent an initial assessment 
with posterior-anterior mobility testing and were 
classified as presence or absence of hypomobility 
and hypermobility. Participants were randomized to 
receive an intervention of manipulation (n=70) or 
stabilization exercise (n=61) for 4 weeks. Disability 
(Oswestry Disability Questionnaire) was recorded 
upon study enrollment and after the 4-week 
treatment. Three-way repeated measures analyses of 
variance were performed to assess interaction effects 
of mobility categorization and intervention on change 
in disability. The authors concluded that patients 
with LBP and hypomobility had better outcomes with 
manipulation while those with hypermobility were 
more likely to benefit from stabilization exercise. This 
study offers Level I prognostic evidence that patients 
with hypomobility had better functional outcomes 
when receiving SMT and those with hypermobility had 
better functional outcomes when receiving exercise.
Haas et al11 conducted a randomized controlled trial to 
evaluate the effect of number of spinal manipulation 
treatment visits with or without physical modalities 
on pain and disability outcomes in patients with LBP. 
Patients were randomized to a treatment interven-
tion of spinal manipulation only or spinal manipula-
tion plus physical modalities (soft tissue therapy, hot 
packs, electrotherapy, or ultrasound). Patients were 
randomly assigned number of visits per week (1, 2, 3, 
or 4) for 3 weeks. Pain intensity and disability (Mod-
ified Von Korff Scales) were recorded. There were no 
significant effects of treatment intervention type. 
There were significant effects of number of treatment 
sessions per week (3-4 sessions per week) on pain and 
disability at 4 weeks. The authors concluded that relief 
was substantial for patients receiving 3 to 4 sessions 
per week for 3 weeks. This study offers Level II prog-
nostic evidence that, in patients with LBP who receive 
SMT, the optimal number of treatments is 3 to 4 times 
a week for 3 weeks. 
Hoehler et al12 investigated the predictive value of a 
modified Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inven-
tory (MMPI) for response to spinal manipulation in 
patients with acute or chronic LBP. Patients referred 
for spinal manipulative therapy (n=90) complet-ed questionnaires and a modified version of MMPI. 
They reported improvement in pain immediately af-
ter treatment and again several days later (reported as 
much better, somewhat better, no change, somewhat 
worse or much worse). Other variables such as age, 
sex and duration of pain were also included in analy-
sis to study predictive value. Immediately after treat-
ment, there were no significant correlations between 
psychological measures and extent of relief. Several 
days after treatment, the percentage of patients re-
porting improvement was lower; lack of improvement 
was associated with hypochondriasis, hysteria and 
functional LBP. The authors concluded that underly-
ing psychosomatic factors may predispose the condi-
tion to recur. This study provides Level III prognostic 
evidence that MMPI scores indicating hysteria, hypo-
chondriasis or higher LBP scores are associated with 
recurrence of pain after manipulation and not associ-
ated with immediate response to SMT.
In an analysis of data from a randomized controlled 
trial, Niemisto et al13 investigated the predictive value 
of sociodemographic data for response to treatment 
for chronic (&gt;3 months) LBP. Patients were random-
ized to receive spinal manipulation therapy (SMT), 
exercise and physician consultation (n=102) or phy-
sician consultation only (n=102). Questionnaires were 
completed to record potential risk factors such as so-
ciodemographics, characteristics of LBP, disability, 
quality of life, work ability, psychological variables 
(Modified Somatic Perception Questionnaire) and 
physical activity at work. Patients were clustered into 
groups based on improvement in pain intensity (VAS) 
and disability (Oswestry Questionnaire) at one-year 
follow-up. Results indicated that severe affective dis-
tress was a risk factor for poor response to SMT. Risk 
factors for poor response to the physician consulta-
tion approach included &gt;25-day sick leave during 
the previous year, poor life control and generalized 
somatic symptoms. The authors concluded that psy-
chosocial differences are important determinants for 
treatment outcomes. This study offers Level II prog-
nostic evidence that, in patients with LBP, severe af-
fective distress is associated with a poor response to 
treatment outcome with SMT.
Underwood et al14 conducted an analysis of the UK 
Back Pain Exercise And Manipulation (UK BEAM) Tri-
al to identify characteristics predictive of response 
to treatment of LBP. The UK BEAM Trial (n=1334) 
found that compared treatment packages of spinal 
manipulation (up to 8 sessions over 12 weeks), ma-
nipulation plus exercise (6 weeks manipulation and 6 
weeks of exercise) and exercise alone (9 group class- Diagnosis &amp; Treatment of Low Back Pain | Recommendations | Physical Medicine &amp; Rehabilitation

Back Book. Disability (Roland Morris Disability Ques-
tionnaire), back pain beliefs (Fear Avoidance Beliefs 
Questionnaire), psychological state (Distress and 
Risk Assessment Method), treatment expectations 
and other demographic characteristics were obtained 
before randomization and at 3-month and one-year 
follow-up. None of the studied baseline characteris-tics predicted response (disability per Roland Morris 
Disability Questionnaire) to treatment. The authors 
concluded that there were no characteristics that pre-
dicted response to the UK BEAM treatment packages. 
This study offers Level II prognostic evidence that, in 
patients with subacute LBP receiving SMT, there were 
no predictors (including pain duration) for response 
to treatment.
Future Directions for Research
1. There has been a lot of work done to look at the CPR for response to acute LBP 
developed by Flynn et al1, with conflicting results. It is possible that a large ran-
domized controlled trial with specific attention to subgroups may identify cer-
tain populations that are responders, as there have been conflicting outcomes 
to date.
2. There is very little work done for clinical predictors in chronic LBP. In addition, 
there have been several well conducted studies looking at response to thrust 
versus nonthrust, mobility versus stability, socioeconomic and psychological fac-
tors and number of visits. Repeated high quality studies looking at these ques-
tions could be useful for generating higher levels of recommendations either for 
or against.FLASK

QQPM&amp;R Question 4. In patients undergoing treatment for low back pain, what are 
outcomes, including duration of pain, intensity of pain, functional outcomes and 
return-to-work status, for exercise therapy alone versus exercise with cognitive 
behavioral therapy (CBT)? 
Recommendation: 
There is conflicting evidence that addition of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) to an exer -
cise program results in significant improvement in pain and function compared to exercise 
alone in patients with chronic low back pain.
 Grade of Recommendation: I  
Steenstra et al1 conducted a randomized controlled 
trial to assess the effectiveness of graded activity as 
part of a return-to-work (RTW) program for patients 
with LBP. Patients enrolled in a multistage RTW 
program who were absent from work greater than 8 
weeks due to LBP were randomized to receive graded 
activity (n=55) or usual care treatment according 
to Dutch occupational physician guidelines for LBP 
(n=57). All these patients were treated initially from 
2 to 6 weeks following injury in a pain management 
program and failed. The graded activity used an 
operant-conditioning behavioral approach in 2 one-
hour sessions per week for a maximum of 26 sessions 
and ended when the participant fully returned to 
work. Outcome measures included severity of pain, 
functional status, total number of days on sick leave 
during follow-up and the number of days off work 
until first RTW for more than 28 days. Graded activity 
prolonged RTW and did not improve pain or functional 
status. The authors concluded that graded activity was 
not effective for any of the outcome measures. This 
study offers Level I evidence that, in patients with 
LBP, graded activity is not effective for improving 
return to work, disability, or pain compared to usual 
care according to Dutch guideline care. 
Lindstrom et al2 studied the effectiveness of graded 
activity to restore occupational function in patients 
with LBP. Blue-collar workers with subacute,  
nonspecific, mechanical LBP, absent from work 
for at least 8 weeks due to LBP were randomized 
to the graded activity group (n=51) or control 
group (n=52). The graded activity program used an 
operant-conditional behavioral approach based on 
measurements of functional capacity and a work-
place visit while the control group continued to be 
traditionally treated by their regular physicians. The 
patients in the graded activity group returned to 
work significantly earlier than those in the control group. The authors concluded that the patients with 
subacute,  nonspecific, mechanical LBP in the graded 
activity group had faster restoration of occupational 
function and reduced long-term sick leave compared 
to those who received traditional care. This study 
provides Level I therapeutic evidence that, in patients 
with subacute LBP, a graded activity program is 
associated with decreased health care utilization, 
increased return to work and decreased sick leave at 2 
years as compared to usual care. 
Johnson et al3 conducted a multicenter randomized 
controlled trial to study the effect of a group exercise and 
education program on pain and disability in patients 
with persistent LBP, as well as its cost-effectiveness 
and whether patient preference influences outcomes. 
Patients who had LBP persisting 3 months after initial 
consultation to one of 9 family medical practices in the 
United Kingdom were randomized into an intervention 
or control group. The control group (n=118) received 
an educational booklet and audio-cassette along with 
usual care. The intervention group (n=116), in addition 
to the same resources as the control group, received 
8 2-hour group sessions over 6 weeks that included 
exercise and education from a physiotherapist using 
a cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) approach. All 
participants were sent a questionnaire that measured 
pain severity (100-mm VAS), disability (Roland-
Morris Disability Questionnaire) and general health 
(EQ-5D) at 3, 9 and 15 months postrandomization and 
at 6 and 12 months post-treatment. Twelve months 
post-treatment, 196 subjects (84%) completed 
follow-up. Both groups had significant improvements 
in pain and disability, but there were no significant 
differences between groups. The incremental cost-
effectiveness ratio was $8,650 per quality adjusted 
life year. Patients in the intervention group who had 
expressed a preference for the intervention before 
randomization had significant improvements in pain  Diagnosis &amp; Treatment of Low Back Pain | Recommendations | Physical Medicine &amp; Rehabilitation

and disability compared to those in the intervention 
group who had initially expressed a preference for 
the control group. The authors concluded that the 
intervention with exercise and education with CBT 
had only a small effect in reducing LBP and disability 
over a one-year period. However, they recommended 
further investigation regarding the impact of patient 
preference for treatment on outcomes. This study 
offers Level I therapeutic evidence that, in patients 
with LBP, addition of group-exercise-based CBT 
produces no meaningful improvement at 15 months 
compared to educational pack alone unless patients 
had preference for treatment. 
In a parallel-group, randomized, superiority 
controlled study, Monticone et al4 investigated the 
effect of a CBT-based multidisciplinary intervention 
program targeted against fear-avoidance beliefs 
in patients with chronic (&gt;3 months) LBP. Patients 
referred to a specialized rehabilitation institute in 
Italy for chronic LBP were randomized to receive 
the intervention treatment with exercise or exercise 
alone. Both groups participated in 2 60-minute 
exercise sessions per week for 5 weeks and were 
encouraged to continue home exercise twice weekly 
for a year. The intervention group (n=45) additionally 
received a 60-minute CBT session each week for 5 
weeks plus a 60-minute session with a psychologist 
once per month for a year. The control group (n=45) 
did not receive any resources in addition to the 
exercise program alone. Participants were asked to 
complete questionnaires pretreatment, immediately 
post-treatment and 12- and 24-months post-
treatment that measured disability (Roland-Morris 
Disability Questionnaire), fear-avoidance behaviors 
(Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia), pain (numerical 
rating scale) and the Short-Form Health Survey. 
All participants completed the follow-up. Results 
revealed significant improvements in all outcomes 
in the intervention group while the control group 
experienced no significant changes. The authors 
concluded that the multidisciplinary program was 
superior to the exercise program in reducing disability, 
fear-avoidance beliefs and pain and enhancing the 
quality of life of patients with chronic LBP for at least 
one year after the conclusion of the intervention. This 
study offers Level I therapeutic evidence that CBT 
via a psychologist with exercise results in significant 
improvement in pain, function and fear-avoidance 
behaviors at one year versus exercise alone.
Vibe Fersum et al5 aimed to compare the effect of 
classification-based cognitive functional therapy 
versus traditional manual therapy and exercise on pain and disability outcomes in patients with LBP. 
Participating patients with chronic LBP (&gt;3 months) 
in outpatient practices in a Norwegian university 
town were randomized into an intervention group or 
control group. The participants in the intervention 
group (n=62) received 12 weeks of individualized 
sessions that included a cognitive component, specific 
movement exercises to normalize maladaptive 
movement behaviors identified, integration of 
daily functional activities that the patient had 
been avoiding and a physical activity program. The 
participants in the control group (n=59) underwent 
joint mobilization or manipulation per best current 
practice and were instructed to complete general 
exercises or motor control exercises at home. Follow-
up questionnaires included perceived function 
(Oswestry Disability Index), pain (Pain Intensity 
Numerical Rating Scale), anxiety and depression 
(Hopkins Symptoms Checklist), fear-avoidance 
beliefs (Fear-Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire), total 
lumbar spine range of motion, patient satisfaction, 
sick-leave days and care-seeking. A total of 51 and 
43 participants completed follow-up assessments in 
the intervention and control groups, respectively. The 
patients in the intervention group had clinically- and 
statistically-significantly greater improvements in 
disability and pain intensity compared to the control 
group. The authors concluded that the classification-
based cognitive functional therapy resulted in superior 
outcomes compared to traditional manual therapy 
and exercise in patients with chronic LBP. In critique, 
less than 80% of study patients completed follow-up. 
Due to this reason, the work group downgraded the 
level of evidence for this study. This potential Level 
I study provides Level II therapeutic evidence that 
physical therapy based cognitive functional therapy 
provides improvements in pain, function and fear-
avoidance behaviors at 1 year compared to standard 
physical therapy. 
Friedrich et al6 conducted a randomized controlled 
trial to investigate the long-term effect of a com-
bined exercise and motivation program versus ex-
ercise alone on disability outcomes in patients with 
chronic (&gt;4 months) LBP in Austria. All participants 
completed a questionnaire at baseline to measure dis-
ability (13-item questionnaire by Greenough and Fra-
ser), pain intensity (101-point numerical rating scale) 
and working ability. The participants randomized 
to the control group (n=49) were prescribed ten 25-
min exercise sessions with follow-up assessments 
at 3.5 weeks (73.5%), 4 months (83.7%), 12 months 
(71.4%) and 5 years (61.2%). In addition to the same 
exercise prescription, the participants randomized  Diagnosis &amp; Treatment of Low Back Pain | Recommendations | Physical Medicine &amp; Rehabilitation

ommendations address a subset of low back pain care as opposed to low back pain in its entirety. This clinical guideline is not intended to be a fixed treatment protocol; it is anticipated that there will be patients who require more or less treatment than what is outlined. This clinical guideline should not be construed as including all proper methods of care or excluding other acceptable methods of care reasonably directed to obtaining the same results. The ultimate judgment regarding any specific procedure or treatment is to be made by the physician and patient in light of all circumstances presented by the patient and the needs and resources particular to the locality or institution.148
to the intervention group (n=44) also received ex-
tensive counseling, reinforcement techniques from 
the therapist and encouragement to post a treatment 
contract and complete an exercise diary. The inter-
vention group had follow-up at 3.5 weeks (86.4%), 
4 months (97.7%), 12 months (77.3%) and 5 years 
(59.1%). Disability scores improved in both groups 
at all follow-up points, but the cumulative effect in 
the intervention group was more than twice than the 
control group. The patients in the intervention group 
experienced a steady decrease in pain intensity from 
baseline to 5-year follow-up while the control group 
only had a decrease in pain intensity from baseline 
to 4-month follow-up. The authors concluded that 
the combined exercise and motivation program was 
superior to exercise alone. In critique, follow-up of 
less than 80% was a factor in downgrading the lev-
el of evidence for this study from Level I to Level II. 
This study provides Level II therapeutic evidence that 
the addition of a motivational program to an exercise 
program provides improvements in pain and working 
ability at one year compared to exercise alone. 
Monticone et al7 investigated the effect of a multidis-
ciplinary rehabilitation program compared to usu-
al care on outcomes in patients with chronic LBP in 
a randomized controlled pilot study. Patients with 
chronic LBP (&gt;3 months) were randomly assigned to 
the intervention group or a control group to receive 
usual care. The control group (n=10) participated 
in rehabilitation with passive spinal mobilization, 
stretching, muscle strengthening and postural con-
trol. The participants in the intervention group (n=10) 
participated in a multidisciplinary program includ-
ing spinal stabilizing exercises and CBT in addition 
to usual care. Participants completed a questionnaire 
to measure disability (Oswestry Disability Index), ki-
nesiophobia (Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia), cata-
strophizing (Pain Catastrophizing Scale), pain (Pain 
Numerical Rating Scale) and quality of life (Short-Form Health Survey) at baseline, immediately after 
the 8-week trial and 3-months post-treatment. The 
authors concluded that the multidisciplinary program 
with CBT and exercise was superior to exercise alone 
in reducing disability, kinesiophobia, catastrophizing 
and enhancing quality of life in patients with chron-
ic LBP. Due to the small sample size, the work group 
downgraded this potential Level I study. This study 
provides Level II evidence that CBT plus stabilization 
exercise plus usual care is better than usual care alone 
at 3 months’ follow-up for patients with chronic LBP. 
Sahin et al8 conducted a randomized controlled trial 
to compare outcomes in patients with chronic LBP 
who participated in a program with exercise, physi-
cal therapy and back school (n=75) compared to ex-
ercise and physical therapy alone (n=75). The back 
school program, taught by a physiatrist, included 
education on the function of the back, life skills and 
discussion of problems and problem-solving skills. 
All participants completed questionnaires to measure 
pain (VAS) and functional status (Oswestry Low Back 
Pain Disability Questionnaire) at baseline, immedi-
ately after the 2-week trial and 3 months after treat-
ment. Both groups experienced improvements in pain 
and functional status immediately after treatment. 
At 3-month follow-up, the participants who partic-
ipated in back school had significantly greater im-
provements in pain and functional status compared to 
those who participants in exercise and physical thera-
py alone. The authors concluded that, in patients with 
chronic LBP, the addition of back school was more 
effective than exercise and physical treatment alone. 
This study provides Level I evidence that, in patients 
with chronic LBP, pain and disability scores improved 
for both PT plus exercise group as well as PT plus ex-
ercise combined with CBT. At 3-month follow-up, the 
addition of CBT resulted in statistically significant but 
not clinically significant improvement compared to 
the group without CBT. 
Future Directions for Research
There were several high-quality studies with heterogeneity across outcome 
measures, cohorts of patients and types of interventions. It is clear that in some 
cases, CBT offered a distinct benefit. Future research will need to focus on de-
tails of comparative effectiveness study design to identify the specific variables 
that contribute to success.FLASK Diagnosis &amp; Treatment of Low Back Pain | Recommendations | Physical Medicine &amp; Rehabilitation

QQPM&amp;R Question 5. In patients undergoing treatment for low back pain, what are 
outcomes, including duration of pain, intensity of pain, functional outcomes and 
return-to-work status, for a lumbar stabilization exercise program versus a general 
fitness program? 
Definition: Lumbar stabilization exercises are focused on facilitating and strengthening specific mus-
cles that directly or indirectly control spinal joint function, especially the abdominal, gluteal and spinal 
extensor muscle groups. General fitness programs are not focused on specific muscle groups; by defi-
nition the goal is to improve the overall general fitness of the patient by using a combination of aerobic 
conditioning with stretching/strengthening of all major muscle groups.
Recommendation: 
It is suggested that a specific stabilization exercise program is equivalent to a general exercise 
program. 
 Grade of Recommendation: B  
Aluko et al1 conducted a preliminary randomized con-
trolled trial to compare outcomes in patients with LBP 
completing regular trunk exercises with or without 
additional core stability exercises. Thirty-three pa-
tients with LBP for ≤6 weeks were randomized to re-
ceive regular core stability exercises (n=17) or regular 
exercise plus 8 specific stabilization exercises (n=16) for 6 weeks. Trunk sagittal acceleration (Lumbar Mo-
tion Monitor), pain (pain VAS) and disability (Roland 
Morris Disability Questionnaire) were measured at 
baseline, 3 weeks, 6 weeks and 3 months. Outcomes 
improved in both groups, but there were no statis-
tical differences between groups. The authors con-

ercises does not provide additional benefits for acute 
LBP compared with exercise alone at short-term fol-
low-up. Due to the small sample size, the work group 
downgraded this study. This potential Level I study 
offers Level II therapeutic evidence that, compared to 
general exercise program, stabilization adds no bene-
fit in terms of pain or disability. 
Koumantakis et al2 compared outcomes in patients 
with subacute or chronic back pain after completing 
an exercise program with versus without addition-
al stabilization exercises in a randomized controlled 
trial. Patients with recurrent nonspecific back pain 
were randomized into an exercise-only group (n=26) 
or stabilization-enhanced exercise group (n=29). All 
participants received The Back Book along with twice 
weekly 45-60 minute sessions and encouraged to re-
peat the assigned exercises at home for 30 minutes 3 
times per week. Outcomes of pain (Short-Form Mc-
Gill Pain Questionnaire), disability (Roland-Morris 
Disability Questionnaire) and cognitive status (Pain 
Self-Efficacy Questionnaire, Tampa Scale of Kinesi-
ophobia, Pain Locus of Control Scale) were record-
ed at baseline, immediately after intervention and 
3-months after intervention. All outcomes improved 
with times in both groups. Disability improved sig-
nificantly more in the general exercise group com-
pared to the stabilization-enhanced group. Otherwise, 
there were no statistically significant differences in 
outcomes between groups. The authors conclud-
ed that the addition of stabilization exercises do not 
appear to provide additional benefit to patients with 
subacute or chronic LBP without spinal instability. In 
critique, the sample size is small and less than 80% 
of patients completed follow-up. In addition these 
are a mixture of subacute and chronic patients that 
are not subgrouped and the distribution across inter-
ventions is uncertain. Due to these reasons, the work 
group downgraded the study from Level I to Level II. 
This study provides Level II therapeutic evidence that 
a general exercise and stabilization program results 
in similar pain relief and functional improvement in 
patients with low baseline disability. 
Unsgaard-Tondel et al3 compared outcomes of motor 
control exercises, sling exercises and general exercis-
es for the treatment of LBP in a randomized controlled 
trial. Patients with chronic  nonspecific LBP (n=109) 
were randomized to one of 3 intervention groups: 
low-load ultrasound-guided motor control exercises 
(n=36), high-load sling exercises (n=36), or general 
exercises (n=37). All participants received an educa-
tional booklet on LBP, were encouraged to stay active 
in their daily lives and participated in their assigned therapy once a week for 8 weeks. Outcomes included 
pain (Numeric Pain Rating Scale), self-reported ac-
tivity limitation (Oswestry Disability Index), function 
(Fingertip-to-Floor Test) and fear-avoidance beliefs 
and were recorded at baseline, after treatment and at 
one-year follow-up. There were no significant dif-
ferences in outcomes between groups. The authors 
concluded that there is no evidence of benefits of the 
studied motor control exercises or sling exercises 
compared to general exercises for chronic LBP. In cri-
tique of the methodology, the work group downgrad-
ed this potential Level I study due to the small sample 
size without power analysis and overall mild disability 
at baseline. This study provides Level II evidence that 
Pilates as a form of stabilization exercise are equal to 
general exercise program for patients with chronic 
LBP and relatively low-level baseline disability. 
Mostagi et al4 aimed to compare pain and function-
ality outcomes of Pilates versus general exercise in 
patients with chronic LBP in a randomized controlled 
trial. Patients with non-specific chronic LBP were 
randomized to participate in Pilates (n=11) or gener-
al exercise (n=11) twice weekly for 8 weeks. Outcome 
measures of pain (VAS), functionality (Quebec Back 
Pain Questionnaire) and flexibility (kinematic anal-
ysis measuring the hip joint angle) were measured 
at baseline, immediately after treatment and after 
three-month follow-up. Follow-up rate was 91%; 
77% of patients were included in analysis. The par-
ticipants in the general exercise group had improved 
functionality at both follow-up time points com-
pared to baseline. There were no significant pain or 
functionality differences between groups otherwise. 
The authors concluded that there were no differences 
in pain and functionality after patients with chronic 
LBP completed general exercise versus Pilates, but 
the subjects in the Pilates group had increased func-
tionality and flexibility. The work group downgraded 
this study due to small sample size and less than 80% 
follow-up. This study provides Level II evidence that 
Pilates is equivalent to general exercise program for 
patients with chronic LBP. 
Rasmussen-Barr et al5 tested the hypothesis that 
stabilizing treatment has more long-term effective-
ness than manual treatment for patients with LBP in 
a randomized trial. Patients with LBP greater than 6 
weeks were randomized to receive 6 weeks of either 
stabilizing training (n=22) or manual therapy (n=20). 
Stabilizing training consisted of training on how to 
activate and control deep abdominal and lumbar mul-
tifidus muscles. Manual therapy included a combina-
tion of muscle stretching, traction, soft tissue mobili- Diagnosis &amp; Treatment of Low Back Pain | Recommendations | Physical Medicine &amp; Rehabilitation

zation and mobilization of thoracic and upper lumbar 
segments if needed. Pain (VAS), general health (VAS), 
functional disability (Oswestry Low-Back Pain Ques-
tionnaire) and perceived difficulty (Disability Rating 
Index) were measured at baseline (n=42), after treat-
ment (n=41) and at 3-month follow-up (n=33) and 
12-month follow-up (n=31). Pain and disability im-
proved in both groups. While there was a small differ-ence favoring stabilization, this was not clinically sig-
nificant. In critique, this study had a small sample size 
and less than 80% follow-up. Due to these reasons, 
the work group downgraded this study. This potential 
Level I study provides Level II therapeutic evidence 
that, in patients with subacute and chronic LBP, SMT 
and stabilization exercise provide similar improve-
ments in pain and function at one year. 
Future Directions for Research
There were several high quality studies with heterogeneity across outcome mea-
sures, cohorts of patients and types of interventions. Future research will need 
to focus on details of comparative effectiveness study design to identify the spe-
cific variables that contribute to success.FLASK

ment and The Back Book, the exercise program group 
(n=310) with up to nine community classes over 12 
weeks in addition to “best care,” the spinal manip-
ulation group (n=353) with 8 sessions over 12 weeks 
in addition to “best care,” or the combined group 
(n=333) which included 6 weeks of manipulation and 6 
weeks of exercise in addition to “best care.” Disability 
(Roland Morris disability questionnaire) was record-
ed at baseline and at 3- and 12-month follow-up. All 
groups experienced improvement in disability scores 
at all time-points. The authors concluded that “rel-
ative to ‘best care’ in general practice, manipulation 
followed by exercise achieved a moderate benefit at 
three months and a small benefit at 12 months; spinal 
manipulation achieved a small to moderate benefit at 
3 months and a small benefit at 12 months; and exer-
cise achieved a small benefit at 3 months but not 12 
months.” Due to less than 80% follow-up, the work 
group downgraded this study from Level I to Lev-
el II. Length of symptoms prior to treatment beyond 
4 weeks was unknown. Therefore the final results 
were evaluated over an unknown duration of baseline 
chronicity. This study offers Level II therapeutic evi-
dence that, in patients with LBP, educational booklet, 
educational booklet plus exercise, educational book-
let plus manipulation alone, and educational booklet 
plus manipulation and exercise provide similar im-
provements in pain and function at one year (baseline 
scores indicate mild disability). In a randomized controlled trial, Hsieh et al2 assessed 
the effectiveness of back school, joint manipulation, 
myofascial therapy and combined joint manipulation 
and myofascial therapy in patients with subacute 
LBP. Patients with LBP for more than 3 weeks but 
less than 6 months were randomly allocated into one 
of four treatment groups for 3 weeks: back school 
(n=48), joint manipulation (n=49), myofascial 
therapy (n=51), or combined joint manipulation and 
myofascial therapy (n=52). Pain (VAS) and Roland-
Morris activity scales were assessed at baseline, 
immediately after the 3-week treatment period and 
6 months after completion of treatment. All groups 
had improvements in outcomes immediately after 
treatment – with no differences between groups. The 
authors concluded that back school or combined joint 
manipulation and myofascial therapy were as effective 
as joint manipulation or myofascial therapy alone for 
the treatment of subacute LBP. The inclusion criteria 
are a weakness in this study, as the outcomes of 
patients with pain ranging from 3 weeks to 6 months 
can be substantially variable, although in this case it 
did not seem to make any difference. This study offers 
Level I therapeutic evidence that, in patients with LBP 
from 3 weeks to 6 months, myofascial therapy, joint 
manipulation, combination therapy (myofascial and 
joint manipulation) and back school provided similar 
improvement in pain and function at 6 months.
Future Directions for Research
There is a need for well-conducted studies to evaluate the benefit of SMT alone 
compared to SMT and exercise in the treatment of LBP. FLASK

QQPM&amp;R Question 7. In patients undergoing treatment for low back pain, what are 
the outcomes, including duration of pain, intensity of pain, functional outcomes 
and return-to-work status, for bed rest versus active exercise? 
Recommendations: 
It is suggested that, for patients with acute low back pain, those that exercise more at base-
line and use exercise to facilitate recovery are predicted to have better functional outcomes 
over time than patients who do not exercise or use bed rest to help with recovery. 
 Grade of Recommendation: B  
For patients with acute low back pain, it is suggested that advice to remain active within limits 
of pain compared to short periods of bed rest from 3 to 7 days all result in similar outcomes in 
pain and function at short- and medium-term follow-up. 
 Grade of Recommendation: B  
Work Group Consensus Statement: 
In the absence of reliable evidence for patients with nonspecific back pain, based on abundant 
data for other spinal disorders that result in back pain, it is the work group’s opinion that remaining 
active is preferred and likely results in better short-term outcomes than does bed rest.
Oleske et al1 evaluated the effect of personal, med-
ical and job factors on recovery from work-related 
low back disorders in an observational longitudinal 
study. Active employees at 2 automotive plants with 
a work-related low back disorder were included in the 
study (n=352). Participants completed a structured 
interview related to LBP, health habits, job factors and 
medical interventions at enrollment and at 1, 2, 6 and 
12 months afterwards. From the interview, 106 items 
were selected as independent variables and compared 
with the dependent variable of recovery from LBP 
(Oswestry Disability Questionnaire). Better recovery 
was associated with lower stress levels and exercise 
outside of work. Cigarette smoking and bedrest were 
associated with higher disability levels. The authors 
concluded that personal modifiable factors are ma-
jor influences in the recovery from work-related, low 
back disorders. This study provides Level II evidence 
that more exercise at baseline is a prognostic factor 
for better improvement than bedrest to help recovery. 
Hagen et al2 conducted a randomized controlled study 
to evaluate the effect of a light mobilization program on the duration of sick leave. Patients who were on 
sick leave 8-12 weeks due to LBP were randomized to 
a control group (n=220) to receive conventional pri-
mary health care or an intervention group (n=237). 
The intervention group was invited to a spine clinic 
for an approximately 3-hour visit with a physician 
and physiotherapist. Participants in the intervention 
group were encouraged to remain active and were giv-
en additional information about LBP and radiographs. 
All participants completed questionnaires at 3, 6 and 
12 months. At all 3 time points, a greater percentage 
of the intervention group had returned to full-du-
ty work compared to the control group. The authors 
concluded that early intervention, information and 
recommendations to stay active significantly reduced 
sick leave for patients with LBP. This study provides 
Level II evidence that, in subacute LBP patients (8 to 
12 weeks LBP), one visit offering reassurance and en-
couragement to increase activity level versus a reg-
ular primary care visit resulted in significantly more 
patients who returned to work at one year. Diagnosis &amp; Treatment of Low Back Pain | Recommendations | Physical Medicine &amp; Rehabilitation
Recommendations were developed based on a specific definition, inclusion/exclusion criteria, and the resulting literature which excluded conditions 
such as presence of a neurological deficit or leg pain experienced below the knee, among others. Given the exclusion criteria, these guideline rec-
ommendations address a subset of low back pain care as opposed to low back pain in its entirety. This clinical guideline is not intended to be a fixed treatment protocol; it is anticipated that there will be patients who require more or less treatment than what is outlined. This clinical guideline should not be construed as including all proper methods of care or excluding other acceptable methods of care reasonably directed to obtaining the same results. The ultimate judgment regarding any specific procedure or treatment is to be made by the physician and patient in light of all circumstances presented by the patient and the needs and resources particular to the locality or institution.154
Rozenberg et al3 conducted a randomized controlled 
trial to compare LBP outcomes after 4 days of bed 
rest versus normal daily activity. Patients with acute 
LBP or an acute-on-chronic episode of LBP with 
current symptoms for &lt;72 hours were randomized 
into two treatment groups. Patients in the bed rest 
group (n=137) were encouraged to stay in bed for at 
least 16 hours of a 24-hour day for 4 days. Patients in 
the normal activity group (n=140) were instructed to 
continue normal daily activity as able and to spend no 
more than 12 hours per 24-hour day in bed. Medical 
treatment was otherwise the same across groups; 
physical therapy, bracing and chiropractic care were 
not allowed in either group for 3 months during the 
trial. Outcomes were measured with the VAS and Eifel 
index (French version of Roland Morris) plus a global 
assessment score. A total of 277 out of 281 patients 
were analyzed with intention-to-treat analysis, 
which satisfied power calculation. Compliance rates 
were 72% and 90% in the bed rest and usual activity 
groups, respectively. At one week and 3 months, both 
groups improved, with no significant difference in 
pain or function scores. The authors concluded that 
normal activity is at least equivalent to bed rest. This 
study provides Level I evidence that, for patients 
with acute LBP of less than 3 days in duration, 
implementation of bed rest for 4 days versus usual 
care results in similar outcomes for pain and function 
at short- and medium-term follow-up. 
Wiesel et al4 aimed to objectively analyze the roles of 
bedrest and medication for the treatment of LBP. Two hundred male basic combat trainees (average age 23 
years) were randomly allocated to an experimental 
group or control group in a 3-section study. The first 
part of the study focused on bedrest (n=80); the sec-
ond and third parts focused on medication treatment 
(n=45 and n=75). During the first section of the study, 
all participants described their pain at baseline and 
were given a quantifiable score each day. The experi-
mental group was admitted to the hospital for bedrest 
treatment until their LBP subsided. The control group 
was assigned restricted-duty without exercise, but 
entailed standing on their feet. The primary outcome 
was return to full duty which occurred when pain was 
resolved and physical exam had returned to normal. 
The bed rest group returned to duty significantly fast-
er than the ambulatory group (6.6 days in the bed rest 
group compared to 11.8 days in the light duty group). 
The authors concluded that bedrest, as compared with 
ambulation, will decrease the amount of time lost 
from work by 40% to 50%; decrease discomfort by 
60%; and, in combination with analgesic medication, 
will further decrease the amount of pain. In critique 
of the methodology, the workgroup downgraded this 
potential Level I study due to the use of non-validat-
ed outcome measures and an unrealistic form of bed 
rest used (hospitalization). This study provides Level 
II evidence that bed rest, in the form of hospitaliza-
tion, results in sooner return to full duty than treat-
ment with light duty in young male combat trainees. 
Outcomes by 2 weeks appeared to be the same. 
Future Directions for Research
The work group recommends future randomized controlled trials to evaluate 
the effect of bed rest on LBPFLASK

Recommendation: 
There is insufficient evidence to provide any reliable predictors of outcomes to an exercise 
program for the treatment of either acute or chronic low back pain.

Underwood et al1 conducted an analysis of the UK 
Back pain Exercise And Manipulation (UK BEAM) Tri-
al to identify characteristics predictive of response to 
treatment of LBP. The UK BEAM Trial (n=1334) found 
that compared treatment packages of spinal manipu-
lation (up to 8 sessions over 12 weeks), manipulation 
plus exercise (6 weeks manipulation and 6 weeks of 
exercise) and exercise alone (9 group classes over 12 
weeks) against usual care, including The Back Book. 
Disability (Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire), 
back pain beliefs (Fear Avoidance Beliefs Question-
naire), psychological state (Distress and Risk As-
sessment Method), treatment expectations and oth-
er demographic characteristics were obtained before 
randomization and at 3-month and one-year fol-
low-up. None of the studied baseline characteris-
tics predicted response (disability per Roland Morris 
Disability Questionnaire) to treatment. The authors concluded that there were no characteristics that pre-
dicted response to the UK BEAM treatment packages. 
This study offers Level II prognostic evidence that, in 
patients with subacute LBP receiving SMT, there were 
no predictors (including pain duration) for response 
to treatment.
Cecchi et al2 prospectively enrolled patients with 
chronic LBP to be treated with an exercise program 
devised by a physical therapist based on the individual 
assessment of each patient. Six sessions were provid-
ed along with education and the patients were encour-
aged to continue with a home exercise program. At one 
year, 211 of 225 patients were contacted for follow-up 
and evaluated for predictors of improvement. The only 
predictive factor of functional outcome at discharge 
was less intense pain at baseline assessment. At one-

health, no history of prior treatment and low drug use 
predicted higher long-term response rates. This is a 
Level I prognostic study to indicate that in patients 
with chronic LBP, short-term favorable response to an exercise program is predicted by less intense pain 
at baseline. Younger age, better mental health, no 
prior history of treatment and lower drug use predict 
better long-term functional outcomes at one year.
Future Directions for Research
Establishing clinical predictors to exercise for the treatment of LBP would be 
very practical and useful for both the patient and provider. Prospective trials or 
post hoc reviews of registry data could be used to improve our understanding 
of these predictors. Great care will need to be taken in study design to ensure 
that LBP is defined in a consistent, measurable and evaluable manner and that 
homogeneous exercise programs are developed and applied across studies to 
improve the strength of the evidence.FLASK

QQInterventional Question 1. In patients with low back pain, do fluoroscopically-
guided epidural steroid injections decrease the duration of pain, decrease the 
intensity of pain, increase the functional outcomes of treatment and improve the 
return-to-work rate?
There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against the use of caudal 
epidural steroid injections in patients with low back pain.
 Grade of Recommendation: I  
Southern et al1 investigated the efficacy of fluoro-
scopic caudal epidural steroid injections for the treat-
ment of chronic lumbar discogenic pain. Patients with 
chronic low back pain (LBP) with evidence of disc pa-
thology without stenosis (n=97) received at least one 
fluoroscopically-guided caudal epidural injection 
with 12 mg of betamethasone and 8 cc of 0.5% lido-
caine. Disability (Roland Morris Disability Question-
naire, RMDQ), pain (Visual Numeric Pain Scale, VNS) 
and patient satisfaction (North American Spine So-
ciety, NASS, patient satisfaction questionnaire) were 
assessed before and after the injection. Eighty-four 
patients were included in follow-up analysis. Patients 
were classified as procedure failure (if a discography and/or surgery was needed after injection) or success 
(score of 1-2 on NASS patient satisfaction, &gt;50% re-
duction in VNS and &gt;2-point change in RMDQ score). 
After at least one year, 19 patients were classified as 
successes and 65 as failures. Patient satisfaction was 
45%. The patients classified as successes had signifi-
cantly lower baseline pain scores. The authors con-
cluded that patient satisfaction exceeds reported rate 
of efficacy of fluoroscopically-guided caudal epidur-
al steroid injections in patients with chronic lumbar 
discogenic pain. This study provides Level IV evidence 
that roughly 20% of patients with chronic discogen-
ic LBP will experience at least 50% reduction in pain

There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against the use of interlaminar 
epidural steroid injections in patients with low back pain.
 Grade of Recommendation: I   
Lee et al2 conducted an observational study to deter-
mine the effect of a fluoroscopic interlaminar epidur-
al steroid injection (ESI) for axial LBP. Patients with 
LBP (n=81) at a single facility received an interlaminar 
ESI and followed-up within the first month and again 
1-2 years later via telephone interview. The proce-
dure was classified as effective if the patient’s report-
ed pain score was reduced by &gt;50%. Sixty-three of 81 
procedures were considered effective at short-term 
follow-up. Thirty-seven (37%) reported greater than 6 months’ symptom relief. There were no significant 
outcome predictors. The authors concluded that the 
therapeutic trial of a fluoroscopic interlaminar ESI 
was effective for axial LBP. This study provides Level 
IV evidence that interlaminar epidural steroid injec-
tions in patients with LBP can be expected to provide 
patient-reported pain relief in roughly 40% of pa-
tients at 6 months or greater. Ninety percent of these 
patients received one or two ESI.

Schwarzer et al1 investigated the relationship between 
pain provocation and the analgesic response in lum-
bar zygapophyseal joint blocks. Patients with LBP for 
greater than 3 months underwent at least one intraar-
ticular, fluoroscopically-guided injection of lidocaine 
into the zygapophyseal joints. Ten minutes after in-
jection, each patient was asked to perform previously 
painful movements and rate the pain as “worse,” “no 
change,” “partial,” “definite” or “complete” relief. If 
the pain relief was less than complete, the same pro-
cedure was completed using the next segmental level. 
Two weeks later, confirmatory blocks using 0.5% bu-
pivacaine were completed for each patient and classi-fied as a positive response if the patient experienced 
&gt;50% improvement in pain (VAS). Analysis of the 203 
joints revealed that reproduction of pain correlated 
with either definite or complete relief of pain after a 
single analgesic block, only with liberal criteria. The 
authors concluded that the validity of pain provoca-
tion alone as a criterion standard in patients under-
going diagnostic lumbar zygapophyseal joint blocks 
should be questioned. This study provides Level I evi-
dence that pain reproduction during a zygapophyseal 
joint injection is not predictive of the zygapophyse-
al joint as the pain generator. The positive predictive 
value was 16%.
In patients selected for facet joint procedures using diagnostic criteria of physical exam and 
a response to a single diagnostic intra-articular injection with 50% relief, it is suggested that 
intra-articular injection of steroids provides no clinically meaningful improvement at 6 months 
 Grade of Recommendation: B  
Carette et al2 conducted a randomized controlled 
study to investigate the effectiveness of corticosteroid 
injections into the facet joints to treat chronic LBP. 
Patients with LBP for at least 6 months who report-
ed immediate pain relief after a diagnostic injection of 
local anesthetic into the facet joints were randomized 
to receive 20 mg methylprednisolone acetate (n=49) 
or isotonic saline (n=48) under fluoroscopic guidance. 
Pain severity (Visual Analog Scale [VAS] and McGill 
pain questionnaire), back mobility and limitation 
of function (modified Sickness Impact Profile) were 
recorded one, 3 and 6 months after injection. There 
were no statistically significant differences between 
groups after one and three months. The methylpred-
nisolone group had greater improvements in pain and 
disability after 6 months, but the differences were re-
duced when concurrent interventions were taken into 
account. The authors concluded that injecting meth-
ylprednisolone acetate into the facet joints is of little 
value in the treatment of patients with chronic LBP. 
This study provides Level II evidence that, in patients 
selected for facet joint injections with steroid using a 
single diagnostic intra-articular block with 50% re-
lief, the outcome of pain relief is similar in the steroid 
group to the saline group. In a double-blind randomized controlled trial, 
Lakemeier et al3 compared the effectiveness of 
intra-articular facet joint steroid injections and 
radiofrequency denervation for the treatment 
of chronic LBP. Patients with LBP for at least 24 
months who had hypertrophy of the facet joints 
L3/L4-5/S1 on magnetic resonance imaging and 
experienced at least 50% pain reduction after a test 
injection of local anesthetics were included in this 
study. Participants were randomized to receive 
radiofrequency denervation (n=27) or intra-articular 
steroid infiltration (n=29). Participants completed the 
RMDQ, VAS and Oswestry Disability Index at baseline 
and after 6 months. Both groups had improvements 
with no significant differences between groups. This 
study provides Level II evidence that, in patients who 
receive a 50% reduction in pain with a single intra-
articular facet joint injection of local anesthetic, 
intra-articular steroids provide similar results to a 
radiofrequency ablation. Neither provides clinically 
meaningful improvements at 6 months.  Diagnosis &amp; Treatment of Low Back Pain | Recommendations | Medical &amp; Psychological Treatment

Schulte et al4 aimed to investigate the clinical im-
provement after a standard facet joint injection ther-
apy protocol and determine the best time for repet-itive injection therapy. Patients with chronic LBP 
diagnosed with lumbar facet joint syndrome (n=39) 
were treated with a standardized protocol of fluo-
roscopically-guided injection therapy. Patients who 
reported at least 50% reduction of pain after initial 
injection of 1 ml crystalline prednisolone acetate (50 
mg) mixed with 2 ml lidocaine (1%) received an in-
jection using only lidocaine and phenol solution (5%, 
1 ml each joint) the next day. Participants completed 
questionnaires that contained the pain disability in-
dex, Macnab criteria (excellent, good, fair or poor) 
and VAS for pain at baseline and after 6 months. Pain 
was reduced up to 6 months. Patients reported as ex-
cellent or good by 62% of patients after 1 month, 41% 
of patients after three months and 36% of patients af-
ter six months. The authors concluded that facet joint 
injection therapy using a standardized protocol is 
safe, effective and easy to perform and recommended 
repetitive injection after 3 months. This study pro-
vides Level IV evidence that, in patients who receive a 
50% reduction in pain with a single periarticular facet 
joint injection of local anesthetic and steroids, periar-
ticular injection of phenol produced excellent to good 
response using Macnab criteria and roughly half of 
patients reported a poor outcome at 6 months. 
There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against the use of steroid in-
jections into the zygapophyseal joint in patients with chronic back pain and a physical exam 
suggestive of facet-mediated pain.

Chaturvedi et al5 evaluated the efficacy of facet joint 
infiltrations for the treatment of chronic LBP. Patients 
with LBP for greater than 3 months (n=44) received 
facet joint injections under fluoroscopic guidance 
(n=39) or CT guidance (n=5). Pain was assessed one 
hour after the procedure and at 1, 4, 12 and 24 weeks. 
Significant pain relief was reported after one hour 
(81.8%), one week (86.3%), 4 weeks (93.3%), 12 weeks 
(85.7%) and 24 weeks (62.5%). The authors conclud-
ed that the minimally invasive facet nerve block was safe, resulted in long-term success rates over 60% 
and should be considered an alternative treatment for 
non-radicular back pain. This study provides Level IV 
evidence that, in patients with greater than 3 months 
of LBP and symptoms and physical exam suggestive 
of facet-mediated pain, intra-articular steroid injec-
tions into the facet joints produces significant pain re-
lief in 90% of patients at 12 weeks and 2/3 of patients 
at 24 weeks. Roughly 15% of patients required more 
than one injection. Diagnosis &amp; Treatment of Low Back Pain | Recommendations | Medical &amp; Psychological Treatment

Future Directions for Research
1. The work group recommends future randomized controlled trials of various 
facet joint interventions including therapeutic injections and radiofrequency 
neurotomy in patients diagnosed with facet joint pain using dual diagnostic 
blocks with 80% relief. 
2. The work group recommends, in patients with suspected facet mediated pain, 
more than one comparison trial between outcomes of patients undergoing dual 
diagnostic blocks with a single local anesthetic versus dual diagnostic blocks 
with local anesthetics with different durations of action and pain relief commen-
surate with the local anesthetic used. FLASK

QQInterventional Question 3. In patients with low back pain, do medial branch 
blocks have a role in defining treatment for low back pain? 
a. Does duration of pain, intensity of pain, functional outcomes and return-to-
work status vary when candidates for neurotomy are determined by single vs 
comparative medial branch blocks? 
b. Is there a threshold for the magnitude of relief from diagnostic facet nerve 
blocks that predict outcomes to neurotomy? 
c. Does duration of pain, intensity of pain, functional outcomes and return-to-
work status vary when candidates for neurotomy are determined by diagnostic 
facet nerve blocks vs intra-articular facet joint injections? 
d. Is there a therapeutic utility of medial branch blocks?
e. Does technical accuracy of medial branch blocks (eg, contrast use) affects its 
validity and effectiveness of subsequent neurotomy?
There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against the use of SPECT imag-
ing in the diagnosis of zygapophyseal joint pain.

receive intra-articular (n=23) or medial branch nerve 
blocks (n=23) with lidocaine and triamcinolone. 
Pain (Numeric Pain Intensity Score) and disability 
(Oswestry Disability Index Score) were measured after 
the injection and after 12 weeks. The intra-articular 
group experienced significantly greater improvements 
in pain and disability. The authors concluded that 
intra-articular lumbar facet joint injections are more 
effective than medial branch nerve blocks in SPECT-
positive patients. In critique of the methodology, the 
work group downgraded this potential Level I study as the diagnostic utility of SPECT imaging was negated 
by injecting bilateral joints and/or bilateral medial 
branch blocks in every patient. This study provides 
Level II evidence that, in patients with LBP and positive 
SPECT imaging showing uptake in the facet joint, 
intra-articular injection of steroid provides at least 
a 50% reduction in pain in roughly 60% of patients 
and steroid injection around the medial branch nerves 
provides at least a 50% reduction in pain in roughly 
25% of patients.
There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against the use of uncontrolled 
medial branch blocks vs. pericapsular blocks for the diagnosis of zygapophyseal joint pain

Birkenmaier et al2 aimed to compare the predictive 
value of uncontrolled medial branch blocks versus 
pericapsular blocks for predicting successful out-
comes of cryodenervation. Patients with LBP for at 
least 3 months were randomized to receive medial 
branch blocks or pericapsular blocks. The patients 
who had a positive response (≥50% improvement in 
LBP for at least 3 hours) were enrolled in the study 
(n=13 in each group). Percutaneous medial branch 
cryodenervation was performed, under fluoroscopic 
guidance, with local anesthesia and 1% mepivacaine 
by use of a Lloyd Neurostat 2000. Pain (VAS), limita-
tion of activity (Macnab) and overall satisfaction were 
recorded at baseline and after 2 and 6 weeks as well as 3 and 6 months. Patients who received diagnostic me-
dial branch blocks had statistically significantly bet-
ter pain relief at 6 weeks and 3 months compared to 
those who received pericapsular blocks. The authors 
concluded that, although both blocks worked, uncon-
trolled medial branch blocks are superior to pericap-
sular blocks in selecting patients for facet joint cryo-
denervation. From a diagnostic perspective, this study 
provides Level III evidence that a single medial branch 
block is a better predictor of an outcome of pain re-
lief following cryodenervation of the medial branch 
nerves than a pericapsular local anesthetic injection.

Kaplan et al3 conducted a randomized controlled trial 
to investigate the effectiveness of conventional medial 
branch blocks for zygapophysial joint pain. In the first 
phase, healthy, asymptomatic adults with no history 
of lumbar pain (n=18) received a fluoroscopically-
guided intra-articular zygapophysial joint injection of 
contrast until pain was elicited. Participants recorded 
pain (VAS) immediately after pain was elicited, every 
hour for the first 6 hours and every day for 7 days. 
In the second phase of this study, the participants 
who incurred pain provocation that lasted less than 
48 hours were randomly allocated to receive medial 
branch nerve injections with 2.0% lidocaine (n=10) 
or saline (n=5). Thirty minutes after injection, the 
participants underwent the same joint injection that 
elicited pain the previous week and recorded pain in 
the same manner. All patients who received saline 
medial branch injections experienced pain on repeat 
capsular distention. Of the individuals who received 
2% lidocaine medial branch blocks, eight felt no pain. 
The authors concluded that the 2% lidocaine was 
significantly more effective on anesthetization of the 
zygapophysial joint when uptake was avoided during 
these injections. The workgroup felt that this type 
of study was not adequately described in the defined 
Levels of Evidence Table and, as a consensus, rated this as Level I. This study provides Level I evidence 
that medial branch blockade with local anesthetic 
effectively anesthetizes the zygapophyseal joint. 
Venous uptake may negatively affect the response to 
medical branch blockade. 
Rocha et al4 studied the prevalence of LBP after con-
trolled medial branch blocks in a prospective, con-
trolled, diagnostic study. Patients with chronic LBP 
for at least 3 months underwent a saline injection fol-
lowed by a controlled medial branch block (0.5 ml of 
lidocaine at 2%, without epinephrine). Pain (VAS) was 
recorded before and after the injection. Patients who 
reported &gt;50% improvement of pain after the block-
ade (n=54) were included in follow-up after one day, 
one week and one, 2 and 3 months. After 3 months, 18 
participants (33%) experienced return of lumbar pain. 
The authors concluded that patient diagnosis with a 
controlled medial branch block was effective but not 
associated with any demographic variables. This study 
provides Level IV evidence that, in patients undergo-
ing medial branch blocks, using a cutoff of a 50% pain 
reduction, 2/3 of the patients who responded to this 
block will have continued reduction in pain 3 months 
after the block.
Thermal radiofrequency ablation is suggested as a treatment for patients with low back pain 
from the zygapophyseal joints. The outcomes of this procedure become more reliable when 
more stringent diagnostic criteria are used. The relief from these ablations is durable for at least 
6 months following the procedure.

Level I. This study provides Level I evidence that me-
dial branch blockade with local anesthetic effectively

blockade. 
Nath et al5 conducted a randomized controlled study 
to determine the effectiveness of percutaneous ra-
diofrequency zygapophysial joint neurotomy in pa-
tients with lumbar zygapophysial joint pain. Patients 
with LBP for at least 2 years who had at least 80% 
pain relief after controlled medial branch blocks were 
randomized to receive an active treatment with 2 mL 
of bupivacaine (n=20) or sham with the same pro-
cedure without radiofrequency (n=20). The degree 
and duration of pain (VAS) was recorded every hour 
for 6 hours after the injection, the following day and 
6-month follow-up. The active treatment group had 
significantly greater improvements in pain, quality 
of life, analgesic consumption and global perception 
of improvement compared to the sham group. The 
authors concluded that radiofrequency facet dener-
vation can be used as a treatment for chronic LBP in 
carefully-selected patients. This study provides Level 
I evidence that, in patients undergoing dual diagnos-
tic comparative medial branch blocks with 80% relief, 
radiofrequency ablation of the medial branch nerves 
provides clinically and statistically significant im-
provements in pain, quality of life variables and an-
algesic consumption compared to sham at 6 months. 
Van Kleef et al6 investigated the effectiveness of per-
cutaneous radiofrequency denervation of the lumbar 
zygapophysial joints in the treatment of LBP origi-
nating from the lumbar zygapophysial joints. Patients 
with LBP for at least one year who had a positive re-
sponse to a diagnostic nerve blockade were random-
ized to receive a 60-second 80°C radiofrequency le-
sion of the dorsal ramus of the segmental nerve roots 
L3-L5 (n=15) or a control group of the same proce-
dure without radiofrequency current (n=16). Physical 
impairment, global perceived effect, pain (VAS) and 
disability (Oswestry disability scale) were recorded 
before the treatment and 8 weeks after treatment. 
Success was defined as ≥50% pain reduction on global 
perceived effect and ≥2-points reduction on the VAS 
scale. The radiofrequency group experiences statis-
tically significantly greater improvements in pain, 
global perceived effect and disability. There were 
more successes in the radiofrequency group at 3, 6 and 
12 months compared to the sham group. The authors 
concluded that radiofrequency lumbar zygapophysial 
joint denervation significantly reduces pain and func-
tional disability on a short-term and long-term basis in a select group of patients with chronic LBP. In cri-
tique of the methodology, the work group downgrad-
ed this potential Level I study due to poor inclusion 
criteria and no concealment prior to randomization. 
This study provides Level II evidence that, in patients 
who have at least a 50% reduction in pain from diag-
nostic medial branch blocks, radiofrequency ablation 
provides better improvements in pain and functional 
outcomes than sham. 
Civelek et al7 compared the effectiveness of facet joint 
injections and facet joint radiofrequency denervation 
in patients with chronic LBP. Patients with LBP who 
did not respond to conservative treatment and diag-
nosed with lumbar facet syndrome were randomized 
to receive a facet joint injection (n=50) or facet joint 
radiofrequency denervation at 80°C temperature for 
120 seconds (n=50). The facet joint injection consist-
ed of a medial branch block of the posterior primary 
ramus with 1 cc of methyl-prednisolone acetate (40 
mg) (diluted with 1 cc SF) combined with 2 cc bupiva-
caine hydrochloride (diluted with 2 cc SF). Pain (NVS), 
patient satisfaction (NASS) and general health status 
(EQ-5D) were recorded at baseline as well as 3, 6 and 
12 months. The patients who received facet joint ra-
diofrequency denervation experienced statistically 
significantly greater improvements in pain at one, 6 
and 12 months. The authors concluded radiofrequen-
cy denervation should be used for the treatment of 
chronic LBP if pain recurs or if pain relief is not expe-
rienced after the first line facet joint injection. In cri-
tique of the methodology, the work group downgrad-
ed this potential Level I study due to poor selection 
criteria for facet joint pain. This study provides Level 
II evidence that, in patients without diagnostic blocks 
with suspected facet pain, radiofrequency ablation 
shows better improvements in pain at 6 months and 
1 year when compared with a medial branch steroid 
injection.
Kroll et al8 conducted a prospective, randomize, 
double-blind study to compare the efficacy of 
continuous radiofrequency thermocoagulation 
with pulsed radiofrequency in the treatment of 
lumbar facet syndrome. Patients were randomly 
allocated to receive continuous radiofrequency 
thermocoagulation at 80°C for 75 seconds (n=13) or 
pulsed radiofrequency at 42°C with a pulse duration 
of 20 ms and pulse rate of 2 Hz for 120 seconds 
(n=13). Pain (VAS) and disability (Oswestry Low Back 
Pain and Disability Questionnaire) were assessed at 
baseline and after 3 months. There were no significant 
differences between groups in relative percentage of 
improvement in pain or disability. The patients in the  Diagnosis &amp; Treatment of Low Back Pain | Recommendations | Medical &amp; Psychological Treatment

continuous radiofrequency thermocoagulation group 
experienced significant improvement in pain and 
disability over time while the pulsed radiofrequency 
group did not experience any significant changes 
over time. The authors concluded that continuous 
radiofrequency resulted in greater improvement over 
time compared to pulsed radiofrequency. In critique, 
the work group downgraded this potential Level I 
study due to lack of follow-up and small sample size. 
This study provides Level II evidence that thermal 
radiofrequency ablation produces clinically and 
statistically significant improvements in pain and 
function at 3 months when compared with pulse 
radiofrequency.
Tekin et al9 compared the effectiveness of conven-
tional radiofrequency and pulsed radiofrequency de-
nervation to medial branches of dorsal rami in the 
treatment of facet joint pain. Patients with chronic 
LBP for more than six months who responded to a di-
agnostic medial branch block (0.3 mL lidocaine 2%) 
with greater than 50% pain reduction on VAS were 
enrolled. Participants were randomly allocated into 
a control group to receive local anesthetic (n=20), or 
treatment groups to receive 80°C conventional radiof-
requency group (n=20), or 2 Hz pulsed radiofrequency 
(n=20). Pain (VAS) and disability (Oswestry Disability 
Index) were recorded before and after the procedure 
as well as 6 months and one year after the procedure. 
Pain and disability improved immediately after the 
procedure in all groups, with lower scores in both 
treatment groups compared to the control group. The 
decrease in pain was maintained at 6- and 12-month 
follow-ups in the conventional radiofrequency group, 
but not the pulsed radiofrequency denervation group. 
The authors concluded that both treatments were 
safe and effective, but conventional radiofrequency 
resulted in long-lasting facet joint pain relief. In cri-
tique of the methodology, the work group downgrad-
ed this potential Level I study due to poor inclusion 
criteria. This study provides Level II evidence that, in 
patients diagnosed with facet pain using a single me-
dial branch block and 50% relief, thermal radiofre-
quency ablation provides statistically significant im-
provements in pain and function when compared to 
pulsed radiofrequency ablation and sham.
In a double-blind randomized controlled trial, 
Lakemeier et al10 compared the effectiveness of 
intra-articular facet joint steroid injections and 
radiofrequency denervation for the treatment 
of chronic LBP. Patients with LBP for at least 24 
months who had hypertrophy of the facet joints 
L3/L4-5/S1 on magnetic resonance imaging and experienced at least 50% pain reduction after a 
test injection of local anesthetics were included in 
this study. Participants were randomized to receive 
radiofrequency denervation (n=27) or intra-articular 
steroid infiltration (n=29). Participants completed the 
RMDQ, VAS and Oswestry Disability Index at baseline 
and after 6 months. Both groups had improvements 
with no significant differences between groups. This 
study provides Level II evidence that, in patients who 
receive a 50% reduction in pain with a single intra-
articular facet joint injection of local anesthetic, 
intra-articular steroids provide similar results to a 
radiofrequency ablation. Neither provides clinically 
meaningful improvements at 6 months. 
In a double-blind randomized controlled trial, 
Leclaire et al11 evaluated the efficacy of percutaneous 
radiofrequency articular facet denervation for the 
treatment of LBP. Patients with LBP for more than 3 
months and positive response after fluoroscopically-
guided intra-articular facet injections were enrolled. 
Participants were randomized into a treatment group 
to receive fluoroscopically-guided percutaneous 
radiofrequency articular facet denervation (n=36) or 
control group to receive sham therapy of the same 
procedure without denervation (n=34). Pain (VAS) and 
disability (Oswestry and RMDQ scales) were recorded 
at baseline and after 4 and 12 weeks. The treatment 
group had significantly greater improvement in 
RMDQ scores compared to the control group at 4 
weeks, with no differences in Oswestry or VAS. There 
were no differences between groups at 12 weeks in any 
outcomes. The authors concluded that radiofrequency 
facet joint denervation may provide short-term 
improvement in functional disability in patients 
with chronic LBP, but the efficacy has not been 
established. In critique of the methodology, the work 
group downgraded this potential Level I study due 
to poor inclusion criteria. This study provides Level 
II evidence that patients who reported relief from 
their back pain within one week of an intra-articular 
steroid injection and undergo radiofrequency ablation 
with the active tip of the needle placed perpendicular 
to the nerve, report no improvement in pain at 3 and 
12 months when compared with sham RF.
MacVicar et al12 investigated the effectiveness of lum-
bar medial branch radiofrequency neurotomy for the 
treatment of chronic LBP. Patients who experienced 
complete relief of pain after controlled diagnostic me-
dial branch blocks (n=106) were treated with radiof-
requency neurotomy performed by 2 trained practi-
tioners. Pain relief of 80-100% for at least 6 months 
with complete return to work and return to activities  Diagnosis &amp; Treatment of Low Back Pain | Recommendations | Medical &amp; Psychological Treatment

of daily living without need for further health care 
was classified as a successful outcome. Successful 
outcomes were achieved in 58% and 53% of patients 
at two different practices. The authors concluded that 
lumbar radiofrequency neurotomy can be an effective 
treatment for chronic back pain when performed in a 
rigorous manner in appropriately-selected patients. 
The study provides Level IV evidence that the major-
ity of patients selected by comparative lumbar facet nerve blocks for radiofrequency neurotomies have 
80–100% relief from their LBP with the restoration of 
activities and no other health care for a median dura-
tion of 15 months. Further, patients that experienced 
successful relief from their LBP after the first radiof-
requency neurotomies will likely experience a similar 
response to repeat radiofrequency neurotomies for 
the same condition. 
Future Directions for Research
The work group recommends randomized controlled trials comparing the re-
sponse to medial branch radiofrequency ablation outcomes to various diagnos-
tic methods of diagnosing zygapophyseal joint pain, including intra-articular fac-
et joint injections and medial branch blocks with varying response rates using 
different local anesthetics.FLASK

QQInterventional Question 4. In patients with low back pain due to lumbar facet joint 
arthropathy, does fluoroscopically-guided neurotomy decrease the duration of 
pain, decrease the intensity of pain, increase the functional outcomes of treatment 
and improve the return-to-work rate?
Thermal radiofrequency ablation is suggested as a treatment for patients with low back pain 
from the zygapophyseal joints. The outcomes of this procedure become more reliable when 
more stringent diagnostic criteria are used. The relief from these ablations is durable for at 
least 6 months following the procedure.
 Grade of Recommendation: B  
Nath et al1 conducted a randomized controlled study 
to determine the effectiveness of percutaneous ra-
diofrequency zygapophysial joint neurotomy in pa-
tients with lumbar zygapophysial joint pain. Patients 
with LBP for at least 2 years who had at least 80% 
pain relief after controlled medial branch blocks were 
randomized to receive an active treatment with 2 mL 
of bupivacaine (n=20) or sham with the same pro-
cedure without radiofrequency (n=20). The degree 
and duration of pain (VAS) was recorded every hour 
for 6 hours after the injection, the following day and 
6-month follow-up. The active treatment group had 
significantly greater improvements in pain, quality 
of life, analgesic consumption and global perception 
of improvement compared to the sham group. The 
authors concluded that radiofrequency facet dener-
vation can be used as a treatment for chronic LBP in 
carefully-selected patients. This study provides Level 
I evidence that, in patients undergoing dual diagnos-
tic comparative medial branch blocks with 80% relief, 
radiofrequency ablation of the medial branch nerves 
provides clinically and statistically significant im-
provements in pain, quality of life variables and an-
algesic consumption compared to sham at 6 months.
Van Kleef et al2 investigated the effectiveness of per-
cutaneous radiofrequency denervation of the lumbar 
zygapophysial joints in the treatment of LBP origi-
nating from the lumbar zygapophysial joints. Patients 
with LBP for at least one year who had a positive re-
sponse to a diagnostic nerve blockade were random-
ized to receive a 60-second 80°C radiofrequency le-
sion of the dorsal ramus of the segmental nerve roots 
L3-L5 (n=15) or a control group of the same proce-
dure without radiofrequency current (n=16). Physical 
impairment, global perceived effect, pain (VAS) and 
disability (Oswestry disability scale) were record-
ed before the treatment and eight weeks after treat-ment. Success was defined as ≥50% pain reduction on 
global perceived effect and ≥2-points reduction on 
the VAS scale. The radiofrequency group experienc-
es statistically significantly greater improvements 
in pain, global perceived effect and disability. There 
were more successes in the radiofrequency group at 
3, 6 and 12 months compared to the sham group. The 
authors concluded that radiofrequency lumbar zyga-
pophysial joint denervation significantly reduces pain 
and functional disability on a short- and long-term 
basis in a select group of patients with chronic LBP. In 
critique of the methodology, the work group down-
graded this potential Level I study due to poor inclu-
sion criteria and no concealment prior to random-
ization. This study provides Level II evidence that, 
in patients who have at least a 50% reduction in pain 
from diagnostic medial branch blocks, radiofrequen-
cy ablation provides better improvements in pain and 
functional outcomes than sham. 
Civelek et al3 compared the effectiveness of facet joint 
injections and facet joint radiofrequency denervation 
in patients with chronic LBP. Patients with LBP who 
did not respond to conservative treatment and diag-
nosed with lumbar facet syndrome were randomized 
to receive a facet joint injection (n=50) or facet joint 
radiofrequency denervation at 80°C temperature for 
120 seconds (n=50). The facet joint injection consist-
ed of a medial branch block of the posterior primary 
ramus with 1 cc of methyl-prednisolone acetate (40 
mg) (diluted with 1 cc SF) combined with 2 cc bupiv-
acaine hydrochloride (diluted with 2 cc SF). Pain (Vi-
sual Numeric Pain Scale), patient satisfaction (NASS) 
and general health status (EQ-5D) were recorded at 
baseline as well as 3, 6 and 12 months. The patients 
who received facet joint radiofrequency denervation 
experienced statistically significantly greater im-
provements in pain at 1, 6 and 12 months. The au- Diagnosis &amp; Treatment of Low Back Pain | Recommendations | Medical &amp; Psychological Treatment

thors concluded radiofrequency denervation should 
be used for the treatment of chronic LBP if pain re-
curs or if pain relief is not experienced after the first 
line facet joint injection. In critique of the methodol-
ogy, the work group downgraded this potential Level I 
study due to poor selection criteria for facet joint pain. 
This study provides Level II evidence that, in patients 
without diagnostic blocks with suspected facet pain, 
radiofrequency ablation shows better improvements 
in pain at 6 months and one year when compared with 
a medial branch steroid injection.
Kroll et al4 conducted a prospective, randomize, 
double-blind study to compare the efficacy of 
continuous radiofrequency thermocoagulation 
with pulsed radiofrequency in the treatment of 
lumbar facet syndrome. Patients were randomly 
allocated to receive continuous radiofrequency 
thermocoagulation at 80°C for 75 seconds (n=13) or 
pulsed radiofrequency at 42°C with a pulse duration 
of 20 ms and pulse rate of 2 Hz for 120 seconds 
(n=13). Pain (VAS) and disability (Oswestry Low Back 
Pain and Disability Questionnaire) were assessed at 
baseline and after 3 months. There were no significant 
differences between groups in relative percentage of 
improvement in pain or disability. The patients in the 
continuous radiofrequency thermocoagulation group 
experienced significant improvement in pain and 
disability over time while the pulsed radiofrequency 
group did not experience any significant changes 
over time. The authors concluded that continuous 
radiofrequency resulted in greater improvement over 
time compared to pulsed radiofrequency. In critique, 
the work group downgraded this potential Level I 
study due to lack of follow-up and small sample size. 
This study provides Level II evidence that thermal 
radiofrequency ablation produces clinically and 
statistically significant improvements in pain and 
function at 3 months when compared with pulse 
radiofrequency.
Tekin et al5 compared the effectiveness of conven-
tional radiofrequency and pulsed radiofrequency de-
nervation to medial branches of dorsal rami in the 
treatment of facet joint pain. Patients with chronic 
LBP for more than 6 months who responded to a di-
agnostic medial branch block (0.3 mL lidocaine 2%) 
with greater than 50% pain reduction on VAS were 
enrolled. Participants were randomly allocated into 
a control group to receive local anesthetic (n=20), or 
treatment groups to receive 80°C conventional radiof-
requency group (n=20), or 2 Hz pulsed radiofrequency 
(n=20). Pain (VAS) and disability (Oswestry Disability 
Index) were recorded before and after the procedure as well as 6 months and one year after the procedure. 
Pain and disability improved immediately after the 
procedure in all groups, with lower scores in both 
treatment groups compared to the control group. The 
decrease in pain was maintained at 6- and 12-month 
follow-ups in the conventional radiofrequency group, 
but not the pulsed radiofrequency denervation group. 
The authors concluded that both treatments were 
safe and effective, but conventional radiofrequency 
resulted in long-lasting facet joint pain relief. In cri-
tique of the methodology, the work group downgrad-
ed this potential Level I study due to poor inclusion 
criteria. This study provides Level II evidence that, in 
patients diagnosed with facet pain using a single me-
dial branch block and 50% relief, thermal radiofre-
quency ablation provides statistically significant im-
provements in pain and function when compared to 
pulsed radiofrequency ablation and sham.
In a double-blind randomized controlled trial, 
Lakemeier et al6 compared the effectiveness of 
intra-articular facet joint steroid injections and 
radiofrequency denervation for the treatment 
of chronic LBP. Patients with LBP for at least 24 
months who had hypertrophy of the facet joints 
L3-4, L4-5, L5-S1 on magnetic resonance imaging 
and experienced at least 50% pain reduction after 
a test injection of local anesthetics were included in 
this study. Participants were randomized to receive 
radiofrequency denervation (n=27) or intra-articular 
steroid infiltration (n=29). Participants completed the 
RMDQ, VAS and Oswestry Disability Index at baseline 
and after 6 months. Both groups had improvements 
with no significant differences between groups. This 
study provides Level II evidence that, in patients who 
receive a 50% reduction in pain with a single intra-
articular facet joint injection of local anesthetic, 
intra-articular steroids provide similar results to a 
radiofrequency ablation. Neither provides clinically 
meaningful improvements at 6 months. 
In a double-blind randomized controlled trial, 
Leclaire et al7 evaluated the efficacy of percutaneous 
radiofrequency articular facet denervation for the 
treatment of LBP. Patients with LBP for more than 3 
months and positive response after fluoroscopically-
guided intra-articular facet injections were enrolled. 
Participants were randomized into a treatment group 
to receive fluoroscopically-guided percutaneous 
radiofrequency articular facet denervation (n=36) or 
control group to receive sham therapy of the same 
procedure without denervation (n=34). Pain (VAS) and 
disability (Oswestry and RMDQ scales) were recorded 
at baseline and after 4 and 12 weeks. The treatment  Diagnosis &amp; Treatment of Low Back Pain | Recommendations | Medical &amp; Psychological Treatment

group had significantly greater improvement in 
Roland-Morris scores compared to the control group 
at 4 weeks, with no differences in Oswestry or VAS. 
There were no differences between groups at 12 
weeks in any outcomes. The authors concluded that 
radiofrequency facet joint denervation may provide 
short-term improvement in functional disability in 
patients with chronic LBP, but the efficacy has not 
been established. In critique of the methodology, the 
work group downgraded this potential Level I study 
due to poor inclusion criteria. This study provides 
Level II evidence that patients who reported relief from 
their back pain within one week of an intra-articular 
steroid injection and undergo radiofrequency ablation 
with the active tip of the needle placed perpendicular 
to the nerve, report no improvement in pain at 3 and 
12 months when compared with sham radiofrequency 
denervation.
MacVicar et al8 investigated the effectiveness of lum-
bar medial branch radiofrequency neurotomy for the treatment of chronic LBP. Patients who experienced 
complete relief of pain after controlled diagnostic me-
dial branch blocks (n=106) were treated with radiof-
requency neurotomy performed by 2 trained practi-
tioners. Pain relief of 80-100% for at least 6 months 
with complete return to work and return to activities 
of daily living without need for further health care 
was classified as a successful outcome. Successful 
outcomes were achieved in 58% and 53% of patients 
at 2 different practices. The authors concluded that 
lumbar radiofrequency neurotomy can be an effective 
treatment for chronic back pain when performed in a 
rigorous manner in appropriately-selected patients. 
The study provides Level IV evidence that the major-
ity of patients selected by comparative lumbar facet 
nerve blocks for radiofrequency neurotomies have 
80–100% relief from their LBP with the restoration of 
activities and no other health care for a median dura-
tion of 15 months. Further, patients that experienced 
successful relief from their LBP after the first radiof-
requency neurotomies will likely experience a similar 
response to repeat radiofrequency neurotomies for 
the same condition.

QQInterventional Question 5. In patients with low back pain, do fluoroscopically-
guided sacroiliac joint injections (SIJI) decrease the duration of pain, decrease the 
intensity of pain, increase the functional outcomes of treatment and improve the 
return-to-work rate? 
a. Does duration of pain, intensity of pain, functional outcomes and return-to-
work status vary when candidates for neurotomy are determined by single vs. 
comparative SIJI?
b. Is there a benefit to performing lateral branch blocks as compared with 
intra-articular diagnostic injections as a predictor to response to lateral branch 
neurotomy?
c. Is there a threshold for the magnitude of relief from diagnostic SIJI that predict 
improvement in duration of pain, intensity of pain, functional outcomes and return-
to-work status from SIJ neurotomy?
Intra-articular steroid joint injections may be considered in patients with suspected SI joint pain
 Grade of Recommendation: C  
Chakraverty et al1 reported hospital audit results on 
the outcomes of patients who underwent spinal in-
jection and interventional procedures for presumed 
facet joint or sacroiliac joint pain. Retrospective chart 
audits were performed of patients with chronic LBP 
from 7 different hospitals. Patients were diagnosed 
with either intra-articular facet joint injections, me-
dial branch blocks, or intra-articular sacroiliac joint 
injections. Pain was recorded using a VAS; pain relief of 
at least 50% indicated response to the diagnostic pro-
cedure. Patients were treated with lumbar facet injec-
tion (n=42), medial branch block (n=10), intra-artic-
ular sacroiliac injection with local anesthesia (n=52), 
intra-articular facet injection with corticosteroid 
(n=34), radiofrequency denervation of medial branch 
(n=38), intra-articular sacroiliac injection with cor-
ticosteroid (n=33), or sacroiliac ligament prolother-
apy (n=19). Thirty percent of patients who received 
an intra-articular corticosteroid injection reported 
greater than 50% pain relief at 6-month follow-up. 
The authors concluded that both radiofrequency de-
nervation and sacroiliac prolotherapy showed good 
long-term outcomes at one year. There appears to be 
a continuing role for intra-articular corticosteroid in-
jections. Sacroiliac ligament prolotherapy is worthy of 
further study. This study provides Level IV evidence 
that patients with mechanical LBP who receive a 50% reduction in pain following a diagnostic sacroiliac 
joint injection may experience up to 6 months of at 
least 50% improvement from their LBP following SIJI 
of local anesthetic and corticosteroid. 
Cusi et al2 investigated the effectiveness of prolother-
apy in the treatment of deficient load transfer of the 
sacroiliac (SI) joint. Patients diagnosed with persistent 
suboptimal stability of the SI joint with LBP for at 
least 6 months were enrolled (n=25). Participants un-
derwent three injections of prolotherapy with 6 weeks 
between each injection. Disability (Roland-Morris) 
and pain (Quebec Back Pain Disability Scale) were re-
ported 24 hours before each injection and one week 
after each injection as well as at follow-up after 3, 12 
and 24 months. Results revealed improvements at 3-, 
12- and 24-month follow-up. The authors conclud-
ed that prolotherapy resulted in positive outcomes for 
a majority of the patients who attended the 3-month 
follow-up visit. This study provides Level IV evidence 
that, in patients with sacroiliac joint pain diagnosed 
using clinical criteria who undergo three prolothera-
py injections, 76% of patients will receive improve-
ments in pain and function at 12 months, though this 
declines to 1/3 of patients at 24 months.

fluoroscopically-guided therapeutic SI joint injections 
for sacroiliac joint syndrome in a retrospective study. 
Patients with LBP who failed to improve after at least 
4 weeks of physical therapy and who had a positive 
response to a fluoroscopically-guided diagnostic SI 
joint injection were included. Participants received 
up to four total therapeutic fluoroscopically-guided 
SI joint injections of 2.0 ml of betamethasone sodium 
phosphate and acetate suspension, 6 mg/ml and 0.5 
ml 2% lidocaine hydrochloride. Pain (VAS), disability 
(Oswestry), work status and medication usage were 
recorded at baseline and an average of 94.4 weeks after 
the last injection. There were statistically significant improvements in disability, pain and work status over 
time. The authors concluded that fluoroscopically-
guided SI joint injections are clinically effective for the 
treatment of SI joint syndrome. This study provides 
Level IV evidence that patients with LBP and reduced 
function due to sacroiliac joint dysfunction having an 
80% improvement from a diagnostic sacroiliac joint 
injection followed by an intra-articular steroid joint 
injection experienced a clinically and statistically 
significant reduction in pain and disability scores. The 
average number of injections was 2.1.

Work Group Narrative: There are other studies in the literature that show clinical benefits from 
cooled lateral branch radiofrequency neurotomies for the treatment of sacroiliac joint pain that 
were not included in our systematic review. These studies were omitted from our review because 
they either did not fulfill our initial definition or inclusion criteria, or were published after our litera-
ture search closed.

ries. Pain relief (VAS), function (pain disability in-
dex) and global patient satisfaction were analyzed. 
Three to 4 months after the procedure, function and 
pain scores significantly improved functional capac-
ity and patient satisfaction. This study provides Lev-
el IV evidence that, in patients who experience a 50% 
reduction in LBP with dual diagnostic intra-articular 
injections, cooled radiofrequency ablation of the lat-
eral branch nerves and L5 dorsal ramus reduces pain 
by approximately 50% in half the patients. 
Karaman et al2 evaluated the safety and efficacy 
of cooled radiofrequency for sacral lateral-branch 
denervation. Patients with chronic sacroiliac pain who 
reported at least 75% pain relief from two diagnostic 
joint blockages were included in this observational study. Participants (n=15) received fluoroscopically-
guided cooled radiofrequency denervation on the 
dorsal ramus and the S1-3 lateral branches. Pain (VAS) 
and physical function (Oswestry Disability Index) were 
recorded after one, 3 and 6 months. Eighty percent of 
the participants reported at least 50% reduction in 
pain scores at 6 months. The authors concluded that 
cooled radiofrequency for sacroiliac denervation was 
effective and safe in the short to intermediate term. 
This study provides Level IV evidence that, in patients 
who reported a 75% reduction in pain with dual 
diagnostic intra-articular SI joint injections, cooled 
radiofrequency neurotomy of the lateral branch 
nerves and L5 dorsal ramus produced a least a 50% 
improvement in pain in roughly 80% of patients. 
Future Directions for Research
1. The work group recommends future research on comparative studies be-
tween lateral branch blocks and intraarticular sacroiliac joint injections for the 
diagnosis of sacroiliac joint pain versus pain from the posterior sacroiliac com-
plex.
2. The work group recommends randomized controlled trials of radiofrequency 
denervation of the lateral branch nerves following lateral branch blocks.
3. The work group recommends randomized controlled trials comparing the var-
ious nerve ablation techniques of the lateral branch nerves for SI joint pain.FLASK

Recommendations were developed based on a specific definition, inclusion/exclusion criteria, and the resulting literature which excluded conditions 
such as presence of a neurological deficit or leg pain experienced below the knee, among others. Given the exclusion criteria, these guideline rec-

This clinical guideline is not intended to be a fixed treatment protocol; it is anticipated that there will be patients who require more or less treatment than what is outlined. This clinical guideline should not be construed as including all proper methods of care or excluding other acceptable methods of care reasonably directed to obtaining the same results. The ultimate judgment regarding any specific procedure or treatment is to be made by the physician and patient in light of all circumstances presented by the patient and the needs and resources particular to the locality or institution.174

QQInterventional Question 7. In patients with low back pain, does spinal cord 
stimulation decrease the duration of pain, decrease the intensity of pain, increase 
the functional outcomes of treatment and improve the return-to-work rate?
There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against the use of spinal 
cord stimulation as a treatment for low back pain. 
 Grade of Recommendation: I  
Vallejo et al1 investigated the effectiveness of spinal 
cord stimulation for relieving discogenic pain in a 
prospective observational study. Patients with intrac-
table discogenic LBP were enrolled. A control group 
was formed of patients with insurance denial, medical 
reasons, or failed trial (n=4) while the remaining par-
ticipants underwent spinal cord stimulation implan-
tation (n=9). Pain (Numerical Rating Scale), disability 
(Oswestry Disability Index) and opioid use were re-
corded at intervals for twelve months. At 12 months, 
there was no change in pain in the control group, but 
significant improvements were observed in the spi-
nal cord stimulation group. Disability decreased, but 
there were no differences in average disability be-tween groups at 12 months. There was a 69% reduc-
tion in opioid consumption in the spinal cord stimu-
lation group and 54% increase in opioid consumption 
in the control group. The authors concluded that spi-
nal cord stimulation may effectively improve pain and 
disability and reduce opioid usage in patients with 
discogenic pain. In critique of the methodology, the 
work group downgraded this potential Level II article 
to Level III due to the small sample size. This study 
provides Level III evidence that, in patients with dis-
cogenic LBP diagnosed with provocative discography, 
spinal cord stimulation produces clinically and statis-
tically significant improvements in pain and function.
Future Directions for Research
The work group recommends randomized controlled trials utilizing spinal cord 
stimulation in patients with LBP.FLASK

QQInterventional Question 8.  In patients with low back pain, does continuous delivery 
of intrathecal opioids decrease the duration of pain, decrease the intensity of pain, 
increase the functional outcomes of treatment and improve the return-to-work 
rate and are there risks associated with its use?
A systematic review of the literature yielded no studies to adequately address this question.

QQInterventional Question 9.  In patients with low back pain, is provocative lumbar 
discography more accurate than other diagnostic modalities in identifying the disc 
as a source of pain?
There is high-level evidence that provocative discography without manometric measure-
ments correlates with pain reproduction in the presence of moderate to severe disc degen-
eration on MRI/CT discography. 
 Grade of Recommendation: A  
Chen et al1 retrospectively investigated the relation-
ship between magnetic resonance (MR) findings and 
pain response during discography. Patients with LBP 
for at least a year who underwent MRI and provoca-
tion discography were included (n=93). The MR im-
ages were interpreted by two experienced radiologists 
and included the grading of disc degeneration (DD) 
per Pearce grade I-V, the presence of high-intensity 
zone (HIZ) and the presence of endplate abnormali-
ties (Modic changes). Discography was reviewed by 
2 experienced radiologists who classified disc mor-
phology as Type I cotton ball; Type II, lobular; Type 
III, irregular; Type IV, fissured; or Type V, ruptured. 
Concordant pain (numeric rating scale) reported by 
the patient during discography was considered pos-
itive. There were statistically significant correlations 
between concordant pain and Type IV-V discs on 
discography, Grade IV-V DD on MR imaging, pres-
ence of HIZ and endplate abnormalities. The authors concluded that DD grades on MR imaging were asso-
ciated with discographic grades. This study provides 
Level I evidence that provocative discography without 
manometric pressure measurements correlates with 
grade IV-V DD, the presence of HIZ and endplate ab-
normalities on MRI.
Weishaupt et al2 aimed to determine the effectiveness 
of MR imaging abnormalities in predicting symptom-
atic disc derangement by investigating the relation-
ship with discography as the standard. Fifty patients 
with chronic LBP underwent MR imaging followed by 
lumbar discography with pain provocation test. MR 
images were evaluated for DD, high-signal-intensity 
zone and endplate abnormalities. Standard discogra-
phy was conducted and pain provocation was rated as 
concordant, noncordant or painless. The abnormali-
ties on MR images were compared with disc morpho-
logic characteristics and pain response on discogra- Diagnosis &amp; Treatment of Low Back Pain | Recommendations | Medical &amp; Psychological Treatment

phy. When comparing abnormalities and considering 
only moderate and severe type I and type II endplate 
abnormalities, all injected discs caused concordant 
pain with provocation (sensitivity, 38%; specificity, 
100%; PPV, 100%). The authors concluded that DD 
and presence of HIZ may not correlate to painful DD, 
but moderate and severe endplate type I and type II 
abnormalities on MR imaging may predict painful 
disc derangement in patients with LBP. This study 
provides Level I evidence that provocative discogra-
phy without manometry correlates with pain in the 
presence of moderate to severe endplate abnormali-
ties on MRI. It did not correlate with HIZ and DD. 
Vanharanta et al3 investigated the relationship be-
tween radiographic findings on CT and pain provoca-
tion discography. Patients with LBP (n=91) underwent 
discography and CT/discography. Disc deterioration 
on discogram was classified as normal, slight, mod-
erate or severe. Pain on provocation discography was 
classified as no pain, dissimilar, similar or exact re-
production of clinical pain. The authors conclud-
ed that as disc deterioration increased, discography 
was more likely to be painful and that CT/Discogra-
phy is a reasonable tool to demonstrate why injection 
into a disc is provoking a patient’s clinical pain. This 
study provides Level I evidence that provocative dis-
cography without manometry correlates with pain in 
the presence of DD on CT scan post discography. The 
absence of pain on provocative discography without 
manometry correlates with a normal disc on CT scan 
post discography.
Collins et al4 compared magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI) findings and lumbar provocative discogra-
phy in order to more precisely define the role in each 
pain diagnosis due to degenerative disc disease. Pa-
tients being considered for surgical treatment due to spinal pain for more than 4 months that was not re-
lieved with conservative therapy were enrolled. After 
patients were examined by MRI, they underwent dis-
cography and reported pain provoked. Seventy-three 
levels were studied by discography in 29 subjects; 13 of 
which reproduced the patient’s symptoms. The dis-
cography findings correlated with MRI in 65 (89.5%) 
subjects. The authors concluded that, of the patients 
who underwent surgery, an annular bulge was present 
in the majority. There were no specific features found 
on the MR images to differentiate symptomatic from 
asymptomatic damaged discs. This study provides 
Level III evidence that provocative discography with-
out manometric pressure measurements correlated 
with DD on MRI scan 90% of the time. Seventy-five 
percent of patients who had a positive discography 
did well with surgical fusion.
Lim et al5 investigated the relationship between mag-
netic resonance (MR) and CT discography findings 
with pain response on provocative discography. Pa-
tients with discogenic back pain (n=47) were enrolled 
in the study and underwent MR imaging followed by 
CT discography. MR images were evaluated for DD, 
endplate abnormalities, facet joint osteoarthritis and 
high intensity zone. Pain during discography was re-
corded as concordant or discordant. In a total of 97 
discs analyzed, there was a significant correlation be-
tween concordant pain and grade 4 or 5 DD, high in-
tensity zone, combination of the above two findings, 
fissured and ruptured disc at discogram and contrast 
beyond inner annulus on CT discogram. The authors 
concluded that these findings are typical with concor-
dant pain at discography. This study provides Level III 
evidence that provocative discography without ma-
nometry correlates with concordant pain in the pres-
ence of grade 4-5 DD on MRI. The presence of annular 
tearing on discography and postdiscography CT scan 
also correlates with painful disc.
There is high-level evidence that provocative discography without manometric pressure mea-
surements correlates with the presence of endplate abnormalities on MRI imaging.

and Type IV-V discs on discography, Grade IV-V DD

study provides Level I evidence that provocative dis-
cography without manometry correlates with pain in 
the presence of moderate to severe endplate abnor-
malities on MRI. It did not correlate with HIZ and DD.
Bony vibration provocation may be considered to correlate with the presence of pain in patients 
who have pain on provocation discography without manometric pressure measurements. There 
is no correlation with the segmental level of pain.

Yrjama and Vanharanta6 aimed to find a noninvasive 
tool for examining the intradiscal source of pain in pa-
tients with low back disorders. Patients with LBP un-
derwent an evaluation using an electrical tool to pro-
duce bony vibration to the lumbar spinal processes. 
Participants indicated when pain was induced when 
the vibrator, a standard electric toothbrush shaft with 
a blunt head instead of a brush, compressed the lum-
bar spinal processes. Immediately following the eval-
uation, participants underwent discography evalua-
tion under fluoroscopy with local anesthesia. Results 
of pain provocation were compared between methods. 
The sensitivity and specificity of the vibration test 
was 0.71 and 0.63, respectively. The authors conclud-
ed that this non-invasive bony-vibration stimulation 
test is easy, quick, inexpensive and reliable for ex-
amining intradiscal pain. In critique of the method-
ology, the work group noted that the bony vibration 
provocation test was not used to identify a segmental 
level of pain. For that reason, along with nonconsec-
utive patients and small sample size, the work group 
downgraded the level of evidence for this potential 
Level III study. This study provides Level IV evidence 
that bony vibration provocation test may correlate 
with the presence of pain on provocative discography 
without manometry, although does not identify the segmental level of pain.
With the same purpose of identifying a non-invasive 
method for spine diagnostics, Yrjama et al7 aimed to 
compare findings on ultrasound, bony vibration stim-
ulation and discography. Patients with LBP were en-
rolled in the study (n=38). Participants were evaluated 
with ultrasound (discs were classified as Grade 0, 1, 2, 
or 3 based on annular ruptures), bony vibration stim-
ulation (induced pain was recorded after compression 
with a commercial electric toothbrush) and discogra-
phy (induced pain was recorded after standard fluo-
roscopically-guided injections). The sensitivity and 
specificity of the vibration provocation test in cases 
of intradiscal ultrasound findings was 0.90 and 0.75, 
respectively; however, the sensitivity and specificity 
was only 0.50 and 0.50 in ultrasound findings of total 
annular ruptures. The authors concluded that a com-
bination of ultrasound and the bony vibration test are 
useful screening tests when evaluating LBP. In cri-
tique of the methodology, the work group downgraded 
the level of evidence for this potential Level III study 
as the quality of evoked pain was not defined, there 
was no correlation between the segment of pain and 
discography findings, a poor reference standard was 
used and due to nonconsecutive patients and small  Diagnosis &amp; Treatment of Low Back Pain | Recommendations | Medical &amp; Psychological Treatment

that ultrasound and vibration screening may possibly 
indicate that the spine is the source  non-specific LBP.
Yrjama et al8 later compared magnetic resonance im-
aging (MRI) and bony vibration test with discographic 
pain provocation findings in patients with LBP. Partic-
ipants (n=33) underwent evaluation by MRI, bony vi-
bration test and fluoroscopically-guided discography. 
The sensitivity and specificity of the bony vibration 
test was 0.88 and 0.50, respectively. The authors con-
cluded that the addition of bony vibration stimulation to MRI evaluation can provide more information on 
the origin of LBP compared to MRI alone. In critique 
of the methodology, the work group downgraded the 
level of evidence for this potential Level III study due 
to lack of a definition for evoked pain, poor reference 
standard, nonconsecutive patients and a small sample 
size. This study provides Level IV evidence that bony 
vibration provocation test may correlate with the 
presence of pain on provocative discography without 
manometry, although does not identify the segmental 
level of pain.
There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against the use of axial loaded 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the diagnosis of low back pain.

Hanna and Tommy9 investigated the relationship be-
tween high-intensity zones (HIZ) and pressure-con-
trolled discography and aimed to determine if detec-
tion of HIZ was affected by axial load. Patients with 
chronic LBP were enrolled (n=41) and underwent 
pressure-controlled discography, CT, magnetic reso-
nance imaging (MRI) and axial loaded MRI. Presence 
of HIZ was compared between MRI methods and pro-
voked pain was recorded as none, unfamiliar, simi-
lar, or exact, on discography. There were no signifi-cant correlations between HIZ and the pain response 
at discography. The sensitivity, specificity, positive 
predictive value and negative predictive value of HIZ 
in detecting discs with “exact pain” on discography 
was 0.49, 0.69, 0.39 and 0.76, respectively. The au-
thors concluded that HIZ was not influenced by axial 
load. This study provides Level I evidence that pres-
sure-controlled provocative discography does not 
correlate with the presence of abnormal findings on 
axial loaded MRI.
There is conflicting evidence that pressure controlled provocative discography correlates with 
nuclear T2 signal intensity on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with low back pain.
 Grade of Recommendation: I   
O’Neill et al10 aimed to determine the accuracy of 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the diagno-
sis of discogenic pain in an observational report of 
patients with chronic LBP. Participants (n=143) un-
derwent MRI which were evaluated for high intensity 
zone (HIZ), nuclear signal, disc height, disc contour 
and bony marrow intensity change. Participants were 
then evaluated using fluoroscopically-guided dis-
cography using a syringe with an integrated pressure 
transducer; pain provocation was classified as posi-
tive or negative at each disc. Moderate loss of nucle-
ar signal combined with disc bulge has a sensitivity of 79.8% and specificity of 79.3% for the diagnosis 
of discogenic pain. The authors concluded that MRI 
parameters are correlated with each other and with 
discography findings. This study provides Level I evi-
dence that pressure-controlled provocative discogra-
phy correlates with pain in the loss of nuclear T2 sig-
nal intensity on MRI.

Participants (n=48) underwent MRI, discography 
and biochemical analysis for inflammatory markers. 
Pfirrmann grading of MRI, concordant pain (VAS) on 
discography and levels of biochemical inflammatory 
markers were compared. The authors concluded that there are only weak correlations between demograph-
ic, discogram and radiographic variables. This study 
provides Level I evidence that pressure-controlled 
provocative discography does not correlate with Pfir-
rmann scores on MRI.
There is conflicting evidence that provocative discography without manometric pressure mea-

considered positive. There were statistically signifi-
cant correlations between concordant pain and Type 
IV-V discs on discography, Grade IV-V DD on MR im-
aging, presence of HIZ and endplate abnormalities. 
The authors concluded that DD grades on MR imaging 
were associated with discographic grades. This study

Saifuddin et al12 retrospectively studied the relation-
ship between magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
and discography findings to determine the sensitiv-
ity of MRI in detecting painful annular tears mani-
fested by the high-intensity zone (HIZ). Patients 
with LBP underwent MRI followed by discography 
(n=58). MR images were evaluated for annular tears 
based on presence of HIZ. Presence and site of dis-
rupted annulus and concordant pain reproduction on 
discography were classified as a positive MRI. A HIZ 
observed on MRI with normal discography was clas-
sified as a false-positive. Of the 152 discs examined 
by discography, 27 HIZ were identified on MRI; 24 
were associated with pain reproduction on discogra-
phy. The authors concluded that the high-intensity 
zone is a marker of a painful posterior annular tear, 
but its usefulness is limited by low sensitivity. This 
study provides Level I evidence that provocative dis-
cography without manometry correlates with pain in 
the presence of an HIZ on MRI. Provocative discogra-
phy without manometry also identified painful discs 
without an HIZ. Diagnosis &amp; Treatment of Low Back Pain | Recommendations | Medical &amp; Psychological Treatment

QQInterventional Question 10. In patients with low back pain, is anesthetic lumbar 
discography more accurate than other diagnostic modalities in identifying the 
disc as a source of pain?
There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against the use of anesthetic 
discography.
 Grade of Recommendation: I  
Alamin et al1 prospectively compared the findings 
from standard pressure-controlled provocative dis-
cography and functional anesthetic discogram in pa-
tients with chronic LBP. Patients with chronic LBP in 
consideration for surgery (n=52) underwent mag-
netic resonance imaging (MRI) followed by standard 
pressure-controlled provocative discography. Pain 
(VAS) and concordancy were reported. If the disc was 
assessed as positive (greater than 5/10 on VAS and 
“similar” or “exact” pain reproduction), functional 
anesthetic discogram was performed. The functional anesthetic discogram evaluation involved two sepa-
rate fluoroscopically-guided injections of 4% lido-
caine and placebo (normal saline) into one or more 
discs of the lumbar spine while the patient was in a 
position or activity that typically caused pain. Pain 
scores were compared at baseline and after each in-
jection. Forty-six percent of the patients had discor-
dant results of the pressure-controlled provocative 
discography and functional anesthetic discogram. The 
authors concluded that the findings from the func-
tional anesthetic discogram differed from those of  Diagnosis &amp; Treatment of Low Back Pain | Recommendations | Medical &amp; Psychological Treatment

standard pressure-controlled provocative discogra-
phy in 46% of the cases reported. This study provides 
Level III evidence that there is a poor correlation be-
tween the findings on provocation discography with 
manometry and functional anesthetic discography. 
Putzier et al2 compared the results of provocative dis-
cography, discoblock (disc analgesia) and magnetic 
resonance (MR) imaging findings. Patients with LBP 
for at least 6 months who had MR imaging with de-
generative disc disease Pfirrmann grade III or IV, with 
or without Modic changes and with or without high in-
tensity zones (HIZ) were included (n=26). Participants 
underwent MR discogram without an MRI-pressure 
measurement syringe and reported pain (Numerical 
Rating Scale, Dallas Discogram Scale) immediately 
after injection. If there was no concordant pain (pain 
endpoint) or fast/markedly manually-registered 
elastic resistance (pressure endpoint) after 2.0 ml 
contrast was applied, patients were categorized as the 
contrast agent leak out through the annulus was reg-
istered in discogram (anatomic endpoint) or not (vol-
ume endpoint). Concordant pain was evoked in 35% of 
the idiopathic degenerated discs and discoblock was 
positive in 64%. Discoblock correlated with concor-
dant pain and Modic changes/discography endpoint. 
The authors concluded that discoblock correlates 
with concordant pain on provocative discography as 
well as presence of Modic changes and can be added to 
surgery decision-making in patients with idiopathic 
degenerated discs. This study provides Level III ev-
idence that single injection anesthetic discography 
correlates with a concordant response on provocative 
discography without manometry. 
Derby et al3 compared data from a multicenter 
prospective review against published results of 
pain relief following injection of local anesthetic 
into lumbar discs that caused concordant pain 
during provocation testing. Patients who underwent 
stand-alone analgesic discography (n=33), routine 
provocative discography followed by injection of 
local anesthetic (n=120), or provocation discography 
followed by injection of local anesthetic through a 
catheter (n=28) were included in the prospective data review from 3 separate facilities. Two cohorts were 
drawn from a previously published study of patients 
who underwent conventional, pressure-controlled 
provocation discography without anesthetic (n=23) or 
provocative discography using an equal combination 
of local anesthetic and contrast (n=47) were also 
included. Subjective pain relief was compared for 
each protocol. None of the patients who received 
pressure-controlled provocation discography 
without anesthetic had pain relief. Less than 10% of 
the patients who underwent provocative discography 
using an equal combination of local anesthetic and 
contrast had pain relief. The authors concluded that 
the stand-alone analgesic discography, provocative 
discography followed by injection of local anesthetic 
and provocative discography with injection of local 
anesthetic through a catheter have similar results 
in confirming painful annular tears by concordant 
pain provocation and 80% or greater pain relief after 
injection of local anesthetic to the lumbar disc. This 
study provides Level IV evidence that local anesthetic 
plus contrast produces similar results to contrast 
alone in the performance of pressure-controlled 
provocative discography. The addition of local 
anesthetic reduces postdiscogram pain. 
Ohtori et al4 conducted a randomized controlled study 
to compare discography and discoblock for the diag-
nosis of discogenic LBP. Patients with LBP and evi-
dence of DD on MRI were randomized to be evaluated 
by discography or discoblock. Surgery was performed 
if the procedure response was positive (n=15 in each 
group). Pain (VAS, Japanese Orthopedic Association 
Score) and disability (Oswestry Disability Index) were 
recorded before and 3 years after surgery. The patients 
who were evaluated with discoblock had significantly 
greater improvements in outcomes compared to those 
evaluated with discography. The authors concluded 
that discoblock with bupivacaine into the painful disc 
was useful for the diagnosis of discogenic LBP com-
pared with discography. This study provides Level IV 
evidence that pain and functional outcomes after sur-
gical fusion are improved more in patients who had 
a single positive anesthetic discogram compared to 
provocation discography without manometry.

QQInterventional Question 11. In patients with low back pain, does intradiscal 
injection decrease the duration of pain, decrease the intensity of pain, increase 
the functional outcomes of treatment and improve the return-to-work rate?
Intradiscal steroids are suggested to provide short-term improvements in pain and func -
tion in patients with Modic changes.
 Grade of Recommendation: B  
Cao et al1 conducted a double-blind, randomized, 
controlled, prospective clinical study to evaluate the 
effectiveness of intradiscal injection regimens for the 
treatment of LBP. Patients with degenerative chronic 
discogenic LBP and endplate Modic changes on mag-
netic resonance imaging (MRI) who received discog-
raphy but did not accept surgical operation were cat-
egorized into Group A (Modic change Type I and Type 
I-predominated mixed Type I/II) or Group B (Mod-
ic change Type II and Type II-predominated mixed 
Type I/II). Each group was randomized into one of 
3 subgroups: (A1/B1) intradiscal injection of normal 
saline, (A2/B2) intradiscal injection of diprospan, or 
(A3/B3) intradiscal injection of diprospan mixed with 
songmeile (cervus and cucumis polypeptide). Pain 
(VAS) and disability (Oswestry Disability Index) were 
recorded 3 and 6 months after the procedure. There 
were no significant differences in outcomes between 
Group A and Group B. There were no significant 
changes in pain or disability in subgroups 1 after 3 or 6 
months. Subgroups 2 and 3 had significant improve-
ments in pain and disability at both follow-up points, 
with no significant differences between groups. The 
authors concluded that intradiscal injection of corti-costeroid could be a short-term efficient alternative 
for discogenic LBP in patients with endplate Mod-
ic changes on MRI unwilling to accept surgery. This 
study provides Level I evidence that intradiscal ste-
roid injections can provide pain relief in patients with 
single level Modic changes and positive provocative 
discography with contrast contained within the disc 
space for up to 6 months. 
Fayad et al2 investigated the relationship between the 
severity of Modic changes on magnetic resonance im-
aging (MRI) and clinical response to intradiscal cor-
ticosteroid injections in patients with chronic LBP. 
Patients with chronic LBP with inflammatory Modic 
changes on MRI who had no response to conservative 
treatment for 3 months were included. Patients were 
classified as Modic type I with pure edema endplate 
changes (n=37), Modic I-2 with mixture of Modic 
type I and type II changes but predominantly edema 
changes (n=25) and Modic II-1 with predominantly 
fatty changes (n=12). All participants received a lum-
bar intradiscal injection of corticosteroids and report-
ed pain intensity (VAS) before and one, three and six 
months after injection. Modic I and Modic I-2 groups  Diagnosis &amp; Treatment of Low Back Pain | Recommendations | Medical &amp; Psychological Treatment

had significantly greater reductions in pain scores 
after one month compared to the Modic II-1 group. 
The authors concluded that intradiscal injection of 
corticosteroids can provide short-term treatment for 
patients with chronic LBP and predominantly inflam-matory endplate changes. This study provides Level 
III evidence that intradiscal steroid injections provide 
short-term pain relief in patients with Modic changes.
There is insufficient evidence that intradiscal steroids provide improvements in pain or function 
in patients with discogenic low back pain.
 Grade of Recommendation: I  
Khot et al3 conducted a randomized trial of patients 
with chronic discogenic LBP to determine the ef-
fect of intradiscal steroid injections in clinical out-
comes after one year. Patients with concordant pain 
on discography were randomized to receive an in-
jection into the disc space of normal saline (n=60) or 
methylprednisolone (n=60). Patients reported pain 
(VAS) and disability (Oswestry Disability Index) for 12 
months post-injection (46 of 60 in the steroid group 
and 52 of 60 in the saline group). There were no sig-
nificant differences in percent change in disability or 
change in pain score between the groups. The authors 
concluded that intradiscal steroid injections do not 
improve clinical outcomes in patients with discogenic 
back pain. The work group downgraded this potential 
Level I study due to low follow-up. This study pro-
vides Level II evidence that intradiscal steroids pro-
vide no benefit over intradiscal saline in patients with 
discogenic LBP. Yavuz et al4 investigated the effectiveness of intra-
discal steroid injections in patients with chronic LBP. 
Patients with chronic LBP due to degenerative disc 
disease (n=18) underwent provocative discography 
to identify the discogenic pain level followed by in-
jection of 1 cc betamethasone. Patients reported pain 
(VAS) and disability related to LBP (Quebec Back Pain 
Disability Scale scores) before as well as 2 weeks and 
3 months after injection. There was a significant re-
duction in pain intensity and significant improvement 
in disability at 2 weeks and 3 months compared to 
baseline. The authors concluded that intradiscal ste-
roid injection may provide short- and mid-term ef-
fectiveness in reducing pain intensity and improving 
LBP-related disability. This study provides Level IV 
evidence that intradiscal steroids result in improved 
pain and function in patients with chronic LBP and 
MRI findings of dark disc, an HIZ or annular tearing 
on discography.
There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against the use of intradiscal 
bone marrow concentrate in patients with discogenic low back pain.
 Grade of Recommendation: I  
Pettine et al5 evaluated the safety and feasibility 
of intradiscal bone marrow concentrate injections 
for the treatment of discogenic LBP. Candidates 
for surgery (failed conservative treatment) with 
discogenic LBP for at least 6 months and evidence of 
degenerative disc pathology on magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) with modified Pfirmann grade of 
IV-VII were included (n=26). Participants received 
a fluoroscopically-guided injection of intradiscal 
bone marrow concentrate into the nucleus pulposus 
of the symptomatic disc(s). Patients were clinically 
evaluated and reported disability (Oswestry Disability 
Index) and pain (VAS) prior to injection and 3, 6, 12 and 24 months after treatment. Twenty-four patients 
avoided surgery for 12 months; 21 avoided surgery 
throughout the 24-month follow-up period. Pain 
and disability improved in the patients who avoided 
surgery. The authors concluded that autologous 
bone marrow concentrate is a safe and feasible non-
surgical treatment option for discogenic pain through 
two years. This study provides Level IV evidence that 
intradiscal injection of autologous bone marrow 
concentrate may provide reductions in back pain and 
disability at 2 years in patients with discogenic back 
pain. Diagnosis &amp; Treatment of Low Back Pain | Recommendations | Medical &amp; Psychological Treatment

There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against the use of intradiscal 
platelet rich plasma in patients with discogenic low back pain.
 Grade of Recommendation: I  
In a double-blind, randomized controlled study, 
Tuakli-Wosornu et al6 evaluated the effect of a 
single injection of autologous platelet-rich plasma 
(PRP) on pain and function. Patients with chronic 
lumbar discogenic pain for at least 6 months who 
were unresponsive to conservative treatment were 
randomized to receive intradiscal PRP (n=36) or 
contrast (n=22) after provocative discography. Pain 
(Numeric Rating Scale, NRS) and physical function (Functional Rating Index, FRI) were recorded after 
one, 4 and 8 weeks, 6 months and one year. The 
authors concluded that patients who received PRP had 
significant improvements in FRI and NRS Best Pain at 
8 weeks compared to control; the FRI improvements 
remained significant at one year. This study provides 
Level II evidence that intradiscal platelet-rich plasma 
may provide improvements in pain and function as 
compared with intradiscal contrast. 
There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against the use of intradiscal 
Methylene Blue in patients with discogenic low back pain.
 Grade of Recommendation: I  
Peng et al7 conducted a randomized placebo-
controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of 
intradiscal methylene blue for the treatment of 
chronic discogenic LBP. Patients with discogenic LBP 
longer than 6 months who underwent discography 
were randomized to receive injection of intradiscal 
methylene blue (n=36) or placebo (n=36). Pain 
(Numerical Rating Scale) and functional recovery 
(Oswestry Disability Index) were recorded 6, 12 and 
24 months after randomization. The participants who 
received methylene blue had significantly greater improvements in pain and disability at 24-month 
follow-up compared to the placebo group. There were 
no adverse effects or complications in the methylene 
blue group. The authors concluded that methylene 
blue injections into painful discs is a safe, effective 
and minimally-invasive method for the treatment 
of intractable and incapacitating discogenic LBP. 
This study provides Level I evidence that Intradiscal 
Methylene Blue provides improvements in pain and 
function when compared with intradiscal normal 
saline in patients with chronic discogenic LBP.
Future Directions for Research
The work group recommends:
• High-level randomized controlled trials using platelet rich plasma and stem 
cells in patients with disc degeneration
• Another RCT of intradiscal steroids in patients with Modic changes
• High-level randomized controlled trials Methylene Blue in patients with disc 
degenerationFLASK

electrothermal therapy or biacuplasty decrease the duration of pain, decrease the 
intensity of pain, increase the functional outcomes of treatment and improve the 
return-to-work rate?
Intradiscal electrothermal annuloplasty is suggested to provide improvements in pain and 
function at up to two years. This treatment is limited in its effectiveness with roughly 40-50% of 
patients receiving a 50% reduction in pain.
 Grade of Recommendation: B  
Pauza et al1 conducted a randomized controlled trial 
to investigate the effectiveness of intradiscal elec-
trothermal therapy (IDET) for the treatment of dis-
cogenic LBP. Patients with discogenic LBP greater 
than 6 months were randomized after provocation 
discography to receive IDET (n=37) or sham treat-
ment of introducing a needle onto the disc in the same 
environment as the real procedure (n=27). IDET was 
performed using a standard protocol, in which a flexi-
ble electrode was navigated into the posterior annulus 
of the painful disc and heated to 90°C. After heating 
and removing the electrode, 1 cc of bupivacaine 0.75% 
mixed with antibiotic was injected into the disc. Pain 
and disability (VAS, Oswestry Disability Scale and 
Short Form-36) were recorded before treatment and 
six months after treatment. Eighty-five percent and 
89% of participants were included in follow-up anal-
ysis in the IDET group and sham group, respective-
ly. Both groups experienced improvements, but the 
treatment group had significantly greater improve-
ments compared to the sham group. The authors con-
cluded that the efficacy of IDET cannot be completely 
attributed to a placebo effect. This study provides Lev-
el I evidence that IDET provides significant improve-
ments in pain and function as compared with sham 
at 6 months. Forty percent of treatment patients re-
ceived at least a 50% reduction in pain.
Bogduk et al2 prospectively evaluated the efficacy of 
intradiscal electrothermal anuloplasty (IDETA) for the 
treatment of LBP. Patients with LBP related to inter-nal disc disruption who underwent discography and 
met inclusion criteria were allocated to a treatment 
group to receive IDETA (n=36) or comparison group if 
their insurer did not approve IDETA (n=17). The treat-
ment group underwent IDETA following standard 
procedure in which an electrode was placed within 
one to 3 electrode diameters from the outer surface of 
the annulus fibrous and heater to 80-90°C. Cefalozin 
was prophylactically administered intravenously be-
fore the procedure and intrasdiscally after the proce-
dure. The comparison group completed a 36-month 
physical therapy program. Pain (VAS), return to work 
and opioid consumption were assessed at baseline, 3 
months, 12 months and 2 years after treatment. The 
comparison group did not experience significant im-
provement in their pain at any follow-up point. The 
treatment group experienced significant improve-
ments in median pain scores which was sustained at 
all follow-up points. The authors concluded that IDE-
TA results in long-term results, 54% of patients can 
reduce their pain by half and one in five patients can 
expect to achieve complete relief of pain. This study 
provides Level II evidence that, in patients who had 
IDETA, pain and functional outcomes remained im-
proved at 2 years.

2-level symptomatic DD with posterior or posterolat-
eral annular tears per provocative discography with 
CT were included. Participants were randomized to 
a treatment group to receive IDET (n=38) or place-
bo group to receive sham treatment (n=19). After the 
IDET catheter was positioned to cover at least 75% of 
the annular tear, the treatment group received elec-
trothermal energy while the placebo group did not. 
Low Back Outcome Scores, Oswestry Disability Index, 
Short Form-36, Zung Depression Index and Modified Somatic Perceptions Questionnaire were measured 
before treatment and after 6 months. There were no 
significant improvements in either group. The au-
thors concluded that IDET provides no significant 
benefit over placebo but the procedure itself appeared 
safe. The work group downgraded this potential Lev-
el II study due to the small sample size that does not 
meet the power statement. This study provides Level 
III evidence that IDET provides no improvements in 
pain and function as compared with sham.
Biacuplasty is an option to produce clinically and statistically significant improvements in pain 
at 6 months in patients with discogenic low back pain.
 Grade of Recommendation: C  
Desai et al4 aimed to investigate the effectiveness 
of intradiscal biacuplasty compared to convention-
al medical management for the treatment of lumbar 
discogenic pain in a multicenter randomized con-
trolled trial. Patients who underwent provocation dis-
cography and diagnosed with lumbar discogenic pain 
were randomized to receive intradiscal biacuplasty 
plus conventional medical management (n=29) or 
individualized conventional medical management in-
cluding physical therapy, pharmacological manage-
ment, interventional procedures and lifestyle chang-
es (n=34). Pain (VAS), disability (Oswestry Disability 
Index), physical functioning (Short Form-36), de-
pression (Beck Depression Inventory), Patient Global 
Impression of Change, EQ-5D and back pain-related 
medication usage were assessed at baseline and af-
ter 6 months. Patients were classified as responders 
if they experienced a 2-point or 30% decrease in VAS 
scores. The intradiscal biacuplasty group experienced 
significantly greater pain reduction compared to con-
ventional medical management alone. Differences 
in other outcomes favored intradiscal biacuplasty. 
The authors concluded that intradiscal biacuplasty 
is more effective for discogenic pain treatment than 
conventional medical management alone. This study 
provides Level I evidence that biaculoplasty provides 
statistically significant improvements in pain, but 
no statistically significant improvement in function 
as compared with conservative management at 6 
months. 
Kapural et al5 investigated the effectiveness of intra-
discal biacuplasty, a bipolar cooled radiofrequency 
system, for the treatment of degenerative disc disease. 
Patients with chronic LBP for more than 6 months and concordant pain on provocative discography un-
derwent intradiscal biacuplasty (n=15). Biacuplasty 
was performed under fluoroscopy using 2 radiofre-
quency probes. Pain disability (Oswestry and Short 
Form-36) and pain (VAS) were assessed at baseline 
and after one, 3 and 6 months. There were no com-
plications related to the procedure. Pain and disability 
improved at one month and remained improved af-
ter 6 months. The authors concluded that intradiscal 
biacuplasty improves pain measures in patients with 
discogenic pain. This study provides Level IV evidence 
that biacuplasty produces clinically and statistical-
ly significant improvements in pain in patients with 
discogenic LBP. 
Fukui and Rohof6 aimed to study the effect of biannular 
pulsed radiofrequency disc method in patients with 
discogenic LBP. Patients with chronic discogenic LBP 
that did not respond to conservative nonoperative 
care (n=15) underwent the pulsed radiofrequency 
technique involving 2 electrodes placed bilaterally 
in the annulus in the disc to apply a radiofrequency 
current for 12 minutes. Pain intensity (Numeric 
Rating Scale) and disability (Roland-Morris Disability

one week and one, 3 and 6 months after treatment. 
Pain and disability improved significantly at the 
6-month follow-up compared to baseline. The authors 
concluded that the biannular pulsed radiofrequency 
technique using Diskit needles is a safe and minimally 
invasive treatment option for patients with chronic 
discogenic LBP. This study provides Level IV evidence

In a prospective observational study, Karaman et al7 
evaluated the efficacy and safety of TransDiscal Bi-
acuplasty. Patients with chronic discogenic LBP for 
at least 6 months, DD or internal disc disruption and 
positive discography who did not respond to conser-
vative treatment were included. Participants (n=15) 
underwent the procedure in which 2 radiofrequency 
probes were passed through introducers and fitted 
into the disc with the probe tip in the posterior annu-
lus. TransDiscal Biacuplasty was applied for 15 min-
utes with the software set at a temperature of 45°C 
and Ramp Rate of 2.0°C/min. Patients were recom-
mended to wear lumbar braces for 6-8 weeks after the 
intervention. Physical function (Oswestry Disability Index), pain (VAS) and patient satisfaction were re-
corded at baseline and one, 3 and 6 months after treat-
ment. At 6-month follow-up, 57.1% of patients had 
at least 50% reduction in pain at 6-month follow-up 
and 78.6% reported reduction of at least 2 points in 
VAS. A total of 78.6% reported 10-point improvement 
in physical function. There were no reported compli-
cations related to treatment. The authors concluded 
that TransDiscal Biacuplasty is effective and safe. This 
study provides Level IV evidence that biacuplasty pro-
duces clinically and statistically significant improve-
ments in pain and function in patients with discogen-
ic LBP.
There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against the use of percutane-
ous intradiscal radiofrequency thermocoagulation.
 Grade of Recommendation: I  
Kvarstein et al8 conducted a randomized double-blind 
controlled trial to evaluate the long-term safety and 
efficacy of percutaneous intradiscal radiofrequen-
cy thermocoagulation with the discTRODE probe. 
Patients with chronic LBP, evidence of moderate 
structural DD on MRI and concordant pain on pres-
sure-controlled provocation discography were ran-
domized to receive intra-annular percutaneous in-
tradiscal radiofrequency thermocoagulation (n=10) or 
sham (n=10). Pain intensity (Numeric Rating Scale), 
Oswestry Disability Index and SF-36 were recorded at baseline and after 6 and 12 months There were no 
significant differences between groups at either fol-
low-up point. The authors concluded that there is no 
evidence of percutaneous intradiscal radiofrequen-
cy thermocoagulation. The work group downgraded 
this potential Level I study due to the small sample 
size; the study was discontinued due to no beneficial 
effects shown. This study provides Level II evidence 
that percutaneous intradiscal radiofrequency ther-
mocoagulation provides no improvements in pain and 
function as compared with sham.
Future Directions for Research
The work group recommends a randomized controlled trial for biacuplasty.FLASK

QQInterventional Question 13. In patients with low back pain, do trigger point 
injections decrease the duration of pain, decrease the intensity of pain, increase 
the functional outcomes of treatment and improve the return-to-work rate?
There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against the use of trigger 
point injections in the treatment of low back pain. The type of injectate does not influence 
outcomes. 
 Grade of Recommendation: I  
In a randomized, double-blind study, Garvey et al1 
investigated the efficacy of trigger-point injection 
therapy for the treatment of LBP. Patients who failed 
four weeks of conservative treatment were included 
in this study LBP (n=63). Patients were randomized 
to receive an injection of lidocaine (n=13), lidocaine 
combined with a steroid (n=14), a single dry-needle 
stick (n=20), or vapocoolant spray with acupressure 
(n=16). Patients rated their level of pain on a scale of 
1 to 10, with 10 being the worst pain experienced, 2 
weeks after injection. Patients reported improvement 
in pain in the lidocaine injection group (40%), lido-
caine plus steroid group (45%), acupuncture group 
(61%) and vapocoolant and acupressure (66%). The 
authors concluded that trigger-point therapy is a use-
ful adjunct in treatment of low-back strain, but the 
injected substance is not the critical factor. The work 
group downgraded this potential Level I study due to 
the short follow-up. This article provides Level II ev-
idence that trigger point therapies reduce pain in 40-
60% of patients at 2 weeks. The type of medication 
used for injection does not affect the outcome.De Andrés et al2 conducted a double-blind randomized 
controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of type-A bot-
ulinum toxin for LBP relief. Patients with LBP due to 
myofascial pain syndrome were enrolled (n=27). Each 
patient received a fluoroscopically-guided injection of 
type-A botulinum toxin to a randomly-selected side 
of the back and a control drug (NaCl 0.8% or bupiv-
acaine 0.25%) injected to the opposite side. Patients 
completed questionnaires at baseline and after 15, 30 
and 90 days to record pain (VAS), disability (Oswestry 
Disability Index) and other lifestyle and psychologi-
cal characteristics. There were no significant changes 
in pain, daily life activities, or psychologic status be-
tween injections. The authors concluded that type-A 
botulinum toxin can provide post-intervention pain 
relief, but only with small differences compared to 
control treatments. The work group downgraded this 
potential Level I study due to the small sample size. 
This article provides Level II evidence that trigger 
point injections with either botulinum toxin A or bu-
pivacaine or normal saline provide similar results; 
none provide clinically meaningful improvements in 
pain or function. Recommendations were developed based on a specific definition, inclusion/exclusion criteria, and the resulting literature which excluded conditions 
such as presence of a neurological deficit or leg pain experienced below the knee, among others. Given the exclusion criteria, these guideline rec-
ommendations address a subset of low back pain care as opposed to low back pain in its entirety. This clinical guideline is not intended to be a fixed 
treatment protocol; it is anticipated that there will be patients who require more or less treatment than what is outlined. This clinical guideline should

results. The ultimate judgment regarding any specific procedure or treatment is to be made by the physician and patient in light of all circumstances

QQSurgical Question 1.  In patients with low back pain, does surgical treatment vs. 
medical/interventional treatment alone decrease the duration of pain, decrease 
the intensity of pain, increase the functional outcomes of treatment and improve 
the return-to-work rate?
A systematic review of the literature yielded no studies to adequately address this question.
A systematic review of the literature yielded no studies to adequately address this question.Work Group Narrative: Several frequently-referenced studies evaluating surgical treatment com-
pared to medical/interventional treatment were excluded because they did not meet inclusion cri-
teria. Patient populations with prior surgical treatment or pain below the knee without subgroup 
analysis were primary factors for eliminating these studies.
Future Directions for Research
The work group recommends undertaking additional randomized controlled 
trials comparing surgical treatment to medical/interventional treatment in pa-
tients with low back pain (LBP) only without history of prior lumbar surgery. FLASK
QQSurgical Question 2.  In patients with low back pain, are there predictive factors 
which determine the benefit of initial treatment with surgical intervention versus 
initial medical/interventional treatment?

QQSurgical Question 3.  In patients undergoing fusion surgery for low back pain, 
which fusion technique results in the best outcomes for the following: decreased 
duration of pain, decreased intensity of pain, increased functional outcomes of 
treatment and improved return-to-work rate? 
a. Posterolateral fusion without internal fixation versus
b. Posterolateral transverse fusion with internal fixation versus
c. Stand-alone (anterior) interbody fusion versus
d. Transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF) or posterior lumbar interbody 
fusion (PLIF) versus
e. Circumferential fusion (anterior interbody, lateral techniques) 
There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against a particular fusion 
technique for the treatment of low back pain. 
 Grade of Recommendation: I  
Madan et al1 described a comparative study of 74 LBP 
patients who received either instrumented circumfer-
ential fusion through a posterior approach (PLIF and 
posterolateral fusion, n=35) or instrumented anteri-
or lumbar interbody fusion (ALIF) using the Hartshill 
horseshoe cage (n=39). Although the article states 
that study data was collected prospectively, it is un-
clear whether the study was carried out in this man-
ner. Therefore, the work group evaluated this study as 
a retrospective analysis. Outcomes were assessed us-
ing the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), quality of life 
questionnaire (subjective), pain drawing, visual ana-
log scale (VAS), disability benefit, compensation sta-
tus and psychological profile using the Modified So-
matic Perception Questionnaire (MSPQ) and the Zung 
Depression Scale (ZDS). At follow-up, 74% of patients 
in the circumferential fusion group and 72% in ALIF 
group reported a satisfactory outcome (p &lt;0.05) and 
80% of patients in both groups reported satisfactory 
outcomes according to ODI criteria. Return to work, 
compensation and disability rates were also similar 
between groups. Authors reported 4 complications 
in the circumferential fusion group, including 3 in-
fections and 1 patient with persistent iliac crest do-
nor site pain for 4 months. Rates of complications in 
the ALIF group were similar with infections in 2 pa-
tients and severe sciatica due to impingement from 
the screw necessitating another operation in 1 patient. 
The authors concluded that ALIF with the Hartshill 
horseshoe cage and circumferential fusion using in-
strumented PLIF are both acceptable in the treatment 
of discogenic back pain. This study provides Level III 
therapeutic evidence that there were no differences in outcomes between circumferential fusion and ALIF 
using Hartshill fixation at 2 years follow-up.
Vamvanij et al2 performed a retrospective analysis of 
various fusion techniques in 56 patients with chron-
ic LBP. Patients received either posterolateral fusion 
(PLF) with iliac crest autograft and translaminar fac-
et screw augmentation (Group 1, n=16), anterior ret-
roperitoneal interbody fusion (ALIF) with allograft 
(Group 2, n=11), PLF with iliac crest autograft sup-
plemented with pedicle screw rod fixation (Group 3, 
n=13), or ALIF with threaded fusion cages and poste-
rior facet fusion with iliac crest autograft (Group 4, 
n=16) and followed for a mean of 4.2 years. Pain in-
tensity, medication required, activity tolerance and 
work status were evaluated on a 4-point scale (excel-
lent, good, fair, poor). The Dallas Pain Questionnaire 
(DPQ) was used to evaluate the degree of pain inten-
sity on daily activities. At follow-up, solid fusion was 
achieved in 50% of patients in Group 1, 60% in Group 
2, 69% in Group 3 and 88% in Group 4. In Groups 1-4, 
a satisfactory result was achieved in 38%, 36%, 46% 
and 63%, respectively. Group 4 had significantly low-
er DPQ scores compared to Groups 1 and 2 (p&lt;0.05) at 
follow-up. Thirty-one percent of patients in Groups 
1 and 2 returned to work and 38% in Groups 3 and 4 
returned to work by follow-up. There were no dif-
ferences in compensation status and disability peri-
ods between patients who were able and those unable 
to go back to work in any group. Complications rates 
were not discussed. The authors concluded that ALIF 
using cages with posterior facet fusion offered the 
highest fusion rate, pain relief and clinical success.  Diagnosis &amp; Treatment of Low Back Pain | Recommendations | Medical &amp; Psychological Treatment

In critique, this study had limited statistical analysis 
and subgroup populations were small. Due to these 
limitations, the work group downgraded the study 
from Level III to Level IV. This study provides Level 
IV therapeutic evidence that circumferential fusion is correlated with better outcomes compared to both in-
strumented PLF and ALIF with allograft, but similar 
in outcomes to PLF with autograft supplemented by 
pedicle screw rod fixation.
Future Directions for Research
The work group recommends the undertaking of: 
1. Large database observational studies, such as multi-center registry studies, 
examining various fusion techniques in patients with LBP only. 
2. Randomized controlled trials examining various fusion techniques in patients 
with LBP only. 
3. Economic studies evaluating the cost-effectiveness of various fusion tech-
niques in patients with LBP only. Given the dearth of literature supporting supe-
riority of fusion technique in LBP patients, economic analysis studies are needed 
to further investigate the costs associated with various techniques. FLASK

At follow-up, solid fusion was achieved in 50% of patients in Group 1, 60% in Group 2, 69% in Group 3 and 88% in Group 4. Fifty percent of patients who achieved solid fusion had satisfactory results compared to only 28% of patients with pseu-darthorisis (p &lt;0.05). Return to work was also signifi-cantly higher in patients with successful fusion com-pared to those without, 43% versus 17% (p&lt;0.05). In Groups 1-4, a satisfactory result was achieved in 38%, 36%, 46% and 63%, respectively. Group 4 had signifi-cantly lower DPQ scores compared to Groups 1 and 2 (p&lt;0.05) at follow-up. Thirty-one percent of patients in Groups 1 and 2 returned to work and 38% in Groups 3 and 4 returned to work at follow-up. There were no differences in compensation status and disability pe-riods between patients who were able and those un-able to go back to work in any group. Complications rates were not discussed. The authors concluded that ALIF using cages with posterior facet fusion offered the highest fusion rate, pain relief and clinical suc-cess. In critique, this study had limited statistical analysis and subgroup populations were small. Due to these weaknesses, the work group downgraded the study from Level III to Level IV. This study provides Level IV therapeutic evidence that there is a correla-tion between solid fusion and functional outcomes.

Work Group Narrative: The majority of literature evaluating sacroiliac joint dysfunction includes 
patients with prior lumbar surgery (which is a frequently recognized predisposing factor for the 
development of sacroiliac dysfunction) and/or lower limb pain (which is a common clinical find-
ing in patients with sacroiliac dysfunction). This review examined only evidence in the subset 
of patients without prior lumbar surgery and without pain below the knee. Additional literature 
comparing surgical treatment to medical/interventional treatment including patients with prior 
lumbar surgery or pain below the knee were not included in our systematic review. Therefore, a 
definitive statement favoring sacroiliac fusion over medical/interventional treatment in patients 
suffering with LBP from an SI source cannot be made.

industry funded) to confirm the superiority of surgical treatment for SJD in

Introduction
The cost of low back pain (LBP) in our society has 
reached staggering proportions. Some studies esti-
mate that LBP costs as much as all cancer care in the 
United States.1 Overall cost of LBP might be as much 
as 100 billion dollars per year including indirect costs 
such as lost productivity.2 There is enormous practice 
variation as it relates to the management of LBP. Uti-
lization of advanced imaging differs widely and uti-
lization of interventional treatments and surgery are 
also sources of variation.3-5 Cost-effectiveness and 
cost-utility research permits valid comparison of dif-
ferent approaches to managing LBP. The purpose of 
this section of the guideline is to summarize the evi-
dence on cost-utility analysis as it relates to the man-
agement of LBP.
A cost-utility analysis is a specific type of cost-
effectiveness evaluation that compares 2 or more 
alternative treatment strategies in terms of both 
cost and outcome. Outcomes are measured in terms 
of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained using 
a preference-based health-related quality of life 
(HR-QOL) outcome tool, such as the EQ-5D (EuroQol 
Group).6-7 An alternative , the SF-6D, which consists 
of 11 items from the short form 36 item Health Survey 
(SF-36)8, is also used in some studies.9 Preference-
based HR-QOL is reported as a number from 0 (death) 
to 1 (perfect health). QALYs gained are determined by 
multiplying the number of years in a given health state by the preference-based HR-QOL score. For example, 
a single year spent in perfect health would be 1 QALY.10
In order to compare the cost-utility of two interven-
tions, A and B, it is important to calculate the incre-
mental cost-utility ratio: Cost of B – Cost of A/ (QALYs 
gained from B-QALYs gained from A).10 In general, 
a treatment is considered to be cost-effective in our 
society when a treatment costs less than $100,000/ 
QALY gained.11
Calculating costs is often challenging. Costs are not 
the same as charges. Direct costs are health costs that 
involve physician time/expertise, facility cost and 
material costs (eg, implant costs). Indirect costs re-
fer to loss of productivity or costs associated with a 
patient’s inability to function (need for home health 
aide or nurse).10 In general, a comprehensive eco-
nomic analysis should include both direct (inpatient 
and outpatient) health costs along with indirect costs, 
which can sometimes be much greater over time than 
direct costs alone.
In this section of the guideline, we have included only 
papers that provided valid cost-utility analyses. In 
some of the sections, there were no papers that sat-
isfied the criteria of a true cost-utility analysis and 
therefore no recommendation could be issued. It is 
important to note that cost-utility is largely depen-
dent upon the country and health system in which the 
research was performed. Diagnosis &amp; Treatment of Low Back Pain | Recommendations | Medical &amp; Psychological Treatment

QQCost-Utility Question 1. Who is the most cost-effective spinal care provider for 
evaluating patients with low back pain:
a. Chiropractor versus
b. Physical Therapist versus
c. Primary Care Provider (including nonphysician providers) versus
d. Neurologist versus
e. Physiatrist versus
f. Spine Surgeon versus
g. Anesthesiologists/Pain Medicine Physician versus
h. Radiologist
A systematic review of the literature yielded no studies to adequately address this question.
Work Group Narrative: Differential utilization of advanced imaging among providers would be expect -
ed to influence cost of evaluating patients with LBP, but a thorough review of the literature did not iden-
tify any true cost-utility studies that permitted any recommendation to be made regarding the effect of 
provider on the cost-utility. One study1 found that the cost of evaluating LBP was higher for orthopedic 
spine surgeons compared with general practitioners; however, there were no outcomes assessed and 
therefore no conclusion could be made regarding cost-effectiveness or cost-utility. Diagnosis &amp; Treatment of Low Back Pain | Recommendations | Medical &amp; Psychological Treatment

Future Directions for Research
Future studies would need to compare different providers by collecting all health 
resource cost data including indirect costs (eg, loss of work productivity) as well 
as measurement of health utility using a validated health preference quality of 
life tool such as the EQ-5D in order to generate true cost-utility comparisons.FLASK

QQCost-Utility Question 2. What is the cost-utility of diagnostic imaging studies/
workup in the evaluation of low back pain (acute, subacute and chronic), in terms 
of influencing/altering treatment or in terms of leading to pain reduction and 
functional improvement? 
a. X-rays (lumbar standing, lumbar flexion-extension, entire spine)
b. CT scan / CT myelogram
c. MRI (conventional or dynamic/upright/weight bearing)
There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against the cost-effectiveness 
of the use of routine ordering of lumbar spine radiographs for low back pain lasting greater than 
6 weeks in the absence of red flags. 
 Grade of Recommendation: I  
Kendrick et al1 and Miller et al2 reported on a 
multicenter randomized controlled trial in the United 
Kingdom with a patient preference arm to test the 
hypotheses that lumbar spine radiography in primary 
care patients with LBP is not associated with improved 
outcomes, is not associated with changes in patient 
management and is not cost-effective compared 
with usual care. Patients with LBP ≥6 months were 
randomized to receive general care from their general 
practitioner (n=211) or a lumbar spine radiograph 
with explanation from their general practitioner 
(n=210). Participants completed questionnaires 
and interviews at baseline, 3 and 9 months, which 
included the Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire 
(RMDQ) score, a VAS for pain, EuroQol-5 (EQ-5D) and 
use of health services. An intention-to-treat analysis 
and economic evaluation with a societal perspective 
were completed. Additionally, 55 participants entered 
a patient preference arm of the study and were given 
the option to choose to have an x-ray (58%). Kendrick 
et al1 concluded that, in the studied population, lumbar 
spine radiography is not associated with improved functioning, severity of pain or overall health status 
and is associated with an increased in workload for the 
general practitioner. In critique of the methodology, 
the work group downgraded this potential Level I 
article due to the heterogeneous patient population. 
This study provides Level II evidence that cost 
per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained is 
redundant and no significant difference between the 
EQ-5D scores for the groups was found. Additional 
QALYs cannot be gained at any cost using lumbar 
spine radiography. Lumbar spine radiographs for the 
evaluation of LBP lasting &gt;6 weeks in the absence of 
red flags is not cost-effective. Miller et al2 concluded 
that lumbar spine radiography is associated with 
increased patient satisfaction, but not improvement 
in clinical outcomes. The work group downgraded this 
potential Level I study due to the heterogeneous patient 
population. This study provides Level II evidence that 
radiography is likely to be cost-effective only when 
satisfaction is valued relatively highly. Strategies to 
enhance satisfaction for patients with LBP without 
using lumbar radiography should be pursued. Diagnosis &amp; Treatment of Low Back Pain | Recommendations | Medical &amp; Psychological Treatment

Diagnosis &amp; Treatment of Low Back Pain | Recommendations | Cost-Utility201
Work Group Narrative: A thorough review of the literature failed to yield any true cost-utility studies 
that permit any recommendations to be made regarding treatment effect cost-utility of the use of MRI, 
CT scan, or CT-myelogram; and the same review yielded limited evidence regarding the use of plain 
radiographs. Additional literature that evaluated diagnostic imaging studies in the evaluation of low 
back pain that did not meet this guideline’s inclusion criteria were not included in our systematic re-
view. Therefore, a definitive statement of the cost-utility of diagnostic imaging studies/workup for all 
patients with LBP cannot be made. 
Future Directions for Research
Intuitively, it would not be expected that diagnostic imaging would provide a 
positive cost-utility in terms of influencing physical treatment, pain reduction, 
or functional improvement in patients with LBP. The work group recommends 
prospective studies evaluating implementation of patient education programs 
regarding the utility of imaging in order to align patient expectations with imag-
ing utility,  improve patient satisfaction and reduce cost.FLASK

QQCost-Utility Question 3. Does the use of ordering physician-owned diagnostic and 
treatment facilities affect the cost of low back pain related healthcare services?
A systematic review of the literature yielded no studies to adequately address this question.
Work Group Narrative: Although a systematic review of the literature revealed no publications directly 
answering the question of whether physician ownership alters the cost-utility of diagnostic or treatment 
services for patients with LBP, some publications have suggested a possible connection. Although 
methodological deficiencies in these publications (including the absence of rigorous cost-utility anal -
yses) excludes them from forming an evidence base for recommendations in this guideline, they serve 
as a foundation for future research in this area.
Future Directions for Research
It is thought that financial incentives may, in some cases, influence clinical 
decision-making. Physician ownership of diagnostic or treatment facilities 
could theoretically increase rates of referral and utilization of those facilities by 
the owning physicians or colleagues. In the case of patients with LBP, early or 
frequent ordering of diagnostic imaging or of therapeutic interventions when not 
clearly indicated could produce higher overall costs in the care of these patients. 
The work group recommends prospective comparative studies to understand 
how physician owned treatment facilities might influence the cost-utility of the 
care of patients with LBP. FLASK Diagnosis &amp; Treatment of Low Back Pain | Recommendations | Medical &amp; Psychological Treatment

Participants completed questionnaires which includ-

and cost per QALY were assessed over 12 months. All 
three treatments improved the average QALY com-
pared to usual care alone. The authors concluded 
that spinal manipulation is a cost-effective addition 
to “best care” for back pain in general practice and 
may have a better value for money alone compared to 
manipulation with exercise. This study provides Lev-

later (n=1,183 included in analysis). If patients did not 
consent to randomization, they received immediate 
acupuncture and were included in the nonrandom-
ized acupuncture group (n=3,846 included in analy-
sis). Trained physicians administered a maximum of 
15 needle acupuncture sessions to each participant. All 
participants completed a questionnaire at baseline and 
after 3 months. Fifty randomly selected participants 
also completed the questionnaire after 6 months. The 
participants in the acupuncture group experienced 
better improvements in function. No life-threatening 
side effects were reported. A cost analysis evaluation 
using a societal perspective (n=2,388) found that the 
probability that acupuncture was cost-effective was 
close to 100%. The authors concluded that acupunc-
ture added to routine care was associated with clinical 
outcome improvements and was relatively cost-ef-
fective. This paper provides Level II evidence that 
acupuncture plus usual care is cost-effective com-
pared to usual care.
Ratcliffe et al2 conducted a randomized controlled 
trial and cost-effectiveness analysis to evaluate the 
cost-effectiveness of acupuncture in 241 patients 
with non-specific LBP in England. Participants were 
randomized at a ratio of 2:1 into an acupuncture group 
(n=160) or usual care only group (n=81). Bodily pain 
was reported on the SF-36 at baseline, 3, 12 and 24 months. Health care utilization details were collect-
ed from provider notes, admission documentation 
and patient questionnaires. Cost-effectiveness anal-
ysis was completed on participants who completed 
the questionnaire at all four time points. During the 
2-year analysis, total cost was higher for the acupunc-
ture group compared to the usual care group, but the 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was positive for 
the acupuncture group. The authors concluded that 
a short course of acupuncture offers a modest health 
benefit for a minor cost compared to usual care for the 
treatment of LBP. In critique of the methodology, the 
work group downgraded this potential Level II study 
due to the limited sensitivity analyses performed. This 
study provides Level III evidence that acupuncture is 
cost-effective when compared to usual care.
In a randomized controlled trial in the United 
Kingdom, Thomas et al3 tested the hypothesis that 
patients with nonspecific LBP would gain more long-
term pain relief for equal or less cost with acupuncture 
added to conventional primary care, compared to 
conventional care only. Participants were randomized 
into an acupuncture group (n=159) or usual care group 
(n=80) and completed the bodily pain dimension 
of the SF-36 at baseline, 3, 12 and 24 months. Cost-
effectiveness was measured using the SF-6D (derived 
from SF-36), EuroQoL 5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) and 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Four patients 
reported minor side effects such as pain at the site of 
needling. At 24 months, the acupuncture service was 
found to be cost-effective. The authors concluded that 
acupuncture in a general practice environment was 
associated with improvement in clinical outcomes 
and was cost-effective over a 2-year period. The work 
group downgraded this potential Level II study due to 
the limited sensitivity analyses performed. Therefore, 
this study provides Level III evidence that acupuncture 
is cost-effective when compared to usual care. Diagnosis &amp; Treatment of Low Back Pain | Recommendations | Medical &amp; Psychological Treatment

Jellema et1 al assessed the cost-effectiveness of a 
psychological-based program compared to usual 
care for the treatment of LBP in the Netherlands. A 
total of 314 participants from 41 general practices 
were enrolled in this cluster-randomized controlled 
trial with an economic evaluation. The participants 
in the intervention group (n=143) participated in 
a 20-minute discussion regarding psychosocial 
prognostic factors related to LBP. The participants in the control group (n=171) received usual care. 
Outcomes such as functional disability (Roland-Morris 
disability questionnaire), perceived recovery (Likert 
scale) and health-related quality of life (EuroQol) 
were collected at baseline and after 12 months. Using 
cost diaries and follow-up information from general 
practitioners, an economic evaluation from a societal 
perspective was conducted. There were no statistically 
significant differences in clinical outcomes between  Diagnosis &amp; Treatment of Low Back Pain | Recommendations | Medical &amp; Psychological Treatment

groups. The complete case analysis and sensitivity 
analyses resulted in inconsistent results regarding 
cost-effectiveness of the intervention. The authors 
concluded that Dutch general practitioners should 
not replace usual care with this new intervention at 
this time. In critique of the methodology, the work 
group downgraded this potential Level II study due to 
missing data and uncertainty of applying the results to 
environments outside of the Netherlands. This study 
provides Level III evidence that a very specific minimal 
intervention strategy exploring psychological factors 
was not cost-effective compared to usual care, which 
was not protocolized. 
Lamb et al2,3 conducted a multicenter randomized 
controlled trial and cost-effectiveness analysis 
from 7 English regions to assess the clinical and 
cost-effectiveness of a group cognitive behavioral 
intervention program added to best practice for the 
treatment of LBP. A total of 701 patients with LBP for 
at least 6 weeks were randomized into a control group 
(n=233) to receive usual care advice (which included 
The Back Book) or an intervention group (n=468) to 
receive usual care advice plus cognitive behavioral 
intervention. This intervention included an individual 
assessment along with 6 1.5-hour group sessions 
over a 2-day course. Questionnaires were completed 
at 3, 6 and 12 months. At 12 months, an intention-
to-treat analysis included 199 (85%) participants 
in the control group and 399 (85%) participants 
in the intervention group. The intervention group 
had significantly greater improvement in RMDQ 
scores and modified Von Korff disability scores. The 
additional quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained 
from the intervention was 0.099 with an incremental 
cost per QALY of £1786 and a &gt;90% probability 
of cost-effectiveness. The authors concluded that 
the intervention resulted in long-term (one-year) 
effectiveness and cost-effectiveness in treating 
subacute and chronic LBP at a low cost to the health-
care provider. This study provides Level III evidence 
that addition of cognitive behavioral approach may be 
cost-effective for patients with LBP.
These results were supported by a cost-utility study 
by Norton et al4 that aimed to evaluate the cost-utility 
of CBT for the treatment of LBP in the United States. 
Commercial health plan members with LBP for at least 6 weeks who independently sought care from a 
general practitioner received standard education and 
were subsequently randomized to a control group or 
treatment group as part of the Back Skills Training 
Trial (BSTT). The control group consisted of a com-
prehensive strategy of multiple approaches to LBP. 
The treatment group received an individual assess-
ment and up to 6 group CBT sessions. All participants 
completed questionnaires that included the EuroQol 
5-dimension (EQ-5D) after one year used to estimate 
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). A Markov decision 
tree model was used to estimate cost-effectiveness 
of the CBT intervention at one and 10 years, using 
costs from the US commercial payer perspective. The 
10-year cost-effectiveness was estimated using the 
probability of distribution into 3 possible health states 
(improved, not improved and dead). After the first 
year, the incremental cost-utility of CBT was $7,197 
per QALY and $5,855 per QALY after 10 years. The au-
thors concluded that CBT is a cost-effective approach 
for treatment of chronic LBP. Although this study was 
not used to develop the final recommendation for this 
question, it provides supplemental evidence by ap-
proaching the question from the perspective of the US 
payers with findings similar to those of Lamb et al.2,3
Whitehurst et al5 compared the cost-utility and 
cost-effectiveness of a brief pain management pro-
gram (BPM) and physical therapy (PT) for the treat-
ment of LBP in the United Kingdom. All participants 
received one 40-minute session plus up to 6 addition-
al 20-minute sessions of the assigned treatment from 
a physiotherapist. Patients randomized to receive the 
BPM (n=201) received a management plan that ad-
dressed known psychosocial risk factors for LBP and 
included general exercises that were not back-specif-
ic (no physical therapy). Participants randomized into 
the PT group (n= 201) received the same amount and 
time of sessions from a physiotherapist that focused 
on manual physiotherapy and back-specific exercis-
es. There were no significant differences in outcomes 
or health care costs between groups. The incremen-
tal cost-per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) was 
£2,362. The authors concluded that PT is a cost-ef-
fective treatment for LBP and suggested that BPM 
could be a possible additional care approach. This 
study provides Level III evidence that a psychological 
based program administered by physical therapists is 
slightly less cost-effective compared to usual care.  Diagnosis &amp; Treatment of Low Back Pain | Recommendations | Medical &amp; Psychological Treatment

treatment approach using directional preference/centralization matched exercise 
more cost-effective than usual care (home care vs medication vs nonspecific 
physical therapy exercise vs nonspecific physical therapy modalities) long-term at

Apeldoorn et al1 compared the cost-effectiveness 
of usual care physical therapy versus a modified 
version of Delitto’s classification-based approach 
for the treatment of LBP in the Netherlands. 
Patients randomized to the control group (n=82) 
received usual physical therapy such as resistive 
strengthening, stretching and postural exercises. 
Patients randomized into the intervention group 
(n=74) were classified to receive direction-specific 
exercises, spinal manipulation, or stabilization 
exercises based on a standard treatment protocol. 
Global perceived effect (7-point Likert scale), pain 
intensity (11-point numerical rating scale), functional status (10-item ODI) and health-related quality of 
life (EuroQol) were recorded at baseline and after 
one year. Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were 
calculated and costs were collected from a societal 
perspective. The participants in the intervention 
group had significantly greater global perceived 
effect, but there were no differences between groups 
in any of the other outcome measures. There was no 
significant difference in cost between groups. The 
authors concluded that the intervention was not cost-
effective compared to physical therapy. This study

Cost-Utility of Medical/Interventional Treatment versus Surgical Treatment Questions
QQCost-Utility Question 13. Is the surgical management (including fusion and lumbar 
disc replacement and spinal cord stimulators) of patients with low back pain more 
cost-effective than medical/interventional treatments? 
There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against the cost-utility of 
surgical therapies versus medical/interventional therapies for low back pain.

Johnsen et al1 assessed the cost-effectiveness of to-
tal disc replacement (TDR) compared to multidisci-
plinary rehabilitation (MDR) in a randomized clinical 
trial of patients with chronic LBP &gt;1 year in Norway. 
Patients randomized to the TDR group (n=86) re-
ceived a disc prosthesis using fluoroscopic guidance. 
Patients randomized to the MDR group (n=87) partic-
ipated in an interdisciplinary outpatient program that 
included exercise and cognitive intervention. Out-
comes recorded included EuroQol 5D (EQ-5D), Short 
Form 6D (SF-6D) and costs at 6 weeks and 3, 6, 12 
and 24 months. Cost analyses were conducted using a 
societal perspective. The authors concluded that TDR 
was cost-effective when using EQ-5D, but not with 
SF-6D. This study provides Level III evidence that 
total disc replacement versus multidisciplinary re-
habilitation results in conflicting evidence regarding 
the cost-utility of total disc replacement based on the 
specific tool used to assess QALYs. The intention to 
treat versus per protocol analysis also provided con-
flicting results.Rivero-Arias et al2 conducted an economic evaluation 
of a randomized controlled trial by Fairbank et al3 to 
compare the cost-effectiveness of surgical spine sta-
bilization with a rehabilitation program in patients 
with chronic LBP in the United Kingdom. Participants 
were randomized to receive spinal stabilization sur-
gery (n=176) or an intensive rehabilitation program 
(n=173). The rehabilitation program included exer-
cise and education-based on principles of cognitive 
behavior therapy for a total of 75 hours. All partici-
pants completed the EuroQoL 5D (EQ-5D), which was 
used to estimate quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). 
Results revealed that spinal stabilization surgery had 
higher associated mean total cost per patient com-
pared to the rehabilitation group, with no significant 
difference between groups in mean QALYs gained. 
The authors concluded that surgical stabilization of 
the spine may not be a cost-effective use of scarce 
health care resources, but that this could change. The 
work group determined that this study provides Level 
III evidence that surgical stabilization is not cost-ef-
fective when compared to an intensive rehabilitation 
program.

8. Patients treated one way with no comparison group of patients treated in another way. Diagnosis &amp; Treatment of Low Back Pain | Recommendations | Medical &amp; Psychological Treatment
Recommendations were developed based on a specific definition, inclusion/exclusion criteria, and the resulting literature which excluded conditions 
such as presence of a neurological deficit or leg pain experienced below the knee, among others. Given the exclusion criteria, these guideline rec-
ommendations address a subset of low back pain care as opposed to low back pain in its entirety. This clinical guideline is not intended to be a fixed treatment protocol; it is anticipated that there will be patients who require more or less treatment than what is outlined. This clinical guideline should not be construed as including all proper methods of care or excluding other acceptable methods of care reasonably directed to obtaining the same results. The ultimate judgment regarding any specific procedure or treatment is to be made by the physician and patient in light of all circumstances presented by the patient and the needs and resources particular to the locality or institution.214

Appendix D: Protocol for NASS Literature Searches
One of the most crucial elements of evidence analysis, 
to support the development of recommendations for 
appropriate clinical care or use of new technologies, 
is the comprehensive literature search.  Thorough as-
sessment of the literature is the basis for the review of 
existing evidence, which will be instrumental to these 
activities.
Background
Since the quality of a literature search directly affects 
the quality of recommendations made NASS adheres 
to a protocol to ensure that all NASS searches are con-
ducted consistently to yield the most comprehensive 
results 
Protocol for NASS Literature Searches
When it is determined that a literature search is need-
ed, NASS research staff will work with the requesting 
parties and our contracted medical librarian to run a 
comprehensive search employing at a minimum the 
following search techniques:
1. A preliminary search of the evidence will be con-
ducted using the following clearly defined search 
parameters (as determined by the content ex-
perts). In addition to the project goal and clinical 
question(s) of interest, the following parameters 
are to be provided to research staff to facilitate 
this systematic literature search:  
• Time frames for search
• Foreign and/or English language
• Order of results (chronological, by journal, 
etc.)
• Key search terms and connectors, with or 
without MeSH terms to be employed
• Age range
• Must answer the following questions:
• Should duplicates be eliminated between 
searches?
• Should searches be separated by term or as 
one large package?
• Should human studies, animal studies or ca-
daver studies be included?
This preliminary search should encompass a 
search of the Cochrane database when access is 
available.
2.  Search results with abstracts will be compiled by 
the medical librarian in both Endnote software 
and a PubMed account, whenever possible.  The medical librarian typically responds to requests 
and completes the searches within 2-5 business 
days.  Results will be forwarded to the Research 
staff, who will share it with the appropriate NASS 
staff member or requesting party(ies).  (Research 
staff has access to Endnote software and will 
maintain a database of search results for future 
use/documentation.) 
3. NASS staff shares the search results with an ap-
propriate content expert (NASS Committee mem-
ber or other) to assess relevance of articles and 
identify appropriate articles to review and on 
which to run a “related articles” search.
4. Based on the content expert’s review, NASS Re-
search staff will then coordinate with the medical 
librarian to conduct the second level searching to 
identify relevant “related articles.” 
5. The medical librarian will forward results to Re-
search staff to again share with appropriate NASS 
staff member.
6. NASS staff shares related articles search results 
with an appropriate content expert (NASS Com-
mittee member or other) to assess relevance of 
this second set of articles and identify appropri-
ate articles to review and on which to run a second 
“related articles” search.
7. NASS Research staff will work with the medical li-
brarian to obtain the 2nd related articles search re-
sults and any necessary full-text articles for review.
8. NASS members reviewing full-text articles should 
also review the references at the end of each arti-
cle to identify additional articles which should be 
reviewed, but may have been missed in the search. 
Protocol for Expedited Searches
Numbers 1, 2 and 3 should minimally be followed for 
any necessary expedited search. Following #3, de-
pending on the time frame allowed, deeper searching 
may be conducted as described by the full protocol or 
request of full-text articles may occur. If full-text ar-
ticles are requested, #8 should also be included. Use of 
the expedited protocol or any deviation from the full 
protocol should be documented with explanation.
Following these protocols will help ensure that NASS 
recommendations are (1) based on a thorough review 
of relevant literature; (2) are truly based on a uniform, 
comprehensive search strategy; and (3) represent the 
current best research evidence available.  Research 
staff will maintain a search history in Endnote, for 
future use or reference.</content><images /></page>
