Overview
Ouch!!! Gotcha!
Pain, although often uncomfortable, is a protective mechanism that alerts us to potential or actual harm to the body's tissues.
Here, the peripheral nervous system sent a pain message to the brain that a bee sting occurred on the nose.
Let's take a look at an instant replay to see how this communication works.
The pain receptors in the skin detect tissue damage from the bee sting. Then, the peripheral nerves send a pain signal to the brain. The brain analyzes the pain signal.
Ouch!!!
In turn, the brain delivers a message back to the muscles of the arm to react.
Hasta la beesta, babee!
As you can tell, it's a very effective system.
